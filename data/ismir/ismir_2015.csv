Dannenberg+Carnegie Mellon University>USA>education,"Optical music recognition (OMR) is the recognition of images of musical scores. Recent research has suggested aligning the results of OMR from multiple scores of the same work (multi-score OMR, MS-OMR) to improve accuracy. As a simpler alternative, we have developed features which predict the quality of a given score, allowing us to select the highest-quality score to use for OMR. Furthermore, quality may be used to weight each score in an alignment, which should improve existing systems’ robustness. Using commercial OMR software on a test set of MIDI recordings and multiple corresponding scores, our predicted OMR accuracy is weakly but significantly correlated with the true accuracy. Improved features should be able to produce highly consistent results."

RITML supports transfer learning by training models with respect to a given template model that can provide prior information for regularisation. With this feature we use information from larger datasets to build better models for more specific datasets, such as user groups from different cultures or of different age. We then evaluate what model parameters, in this case acoustic features, are relevant for the specific models when compared to the general user data. We to this end introduce the new CASimIR dataset, the first openly available relative similarity dataset with user attributes. With two age-related subsets, we show that transfer learning with RITML leads to better age-specific models. RITML here improves learning on small datasets. Using the larger MagnaTagATune dataset, we show that RITML performs as well as state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of general similarity estimation."

In this work, we provide evidence that musical genres can to a large extent be objectively modeled via a combination of musical attributes. We employ a data-driven approach utilizing a subset of 48 hand-labeled musical attributes comprising instrumentation, timbre, and rhythm across more than one million examples from Pandora Internet Radio’s Music Genome Project. A set of audio features motivated by timbre and rhythm are then implemented to model genre both directly and through audio-driven models derived from the hand-labeled musical attributes. In most cases, machine learning models built directly from hand-labeled attributes outperform models based on audio features. Among the audio-based models, those that combine audio features and learned musical attributes perform better than those derived from audio features alone."

Tralie+Duke University>USA>education|Duke University>USA>education;Paul Bendich+Duke University>USA>education|Duke University>USA>education,"We introduce a novel low level feature for identifying cover songs which quantifies the relative changes in the smoothed frequency spectrum of a song. Our key insight is that a sliding window representation of a chunk of audio can be viewed as a time-ordered point cloud in high dimensions. For corresponding chunks of audio between different versions of the same song, these point clouds are approximately rotated, translated, and scaled copies of each other. If we treat MFCC embeddings as point clouds and cast the problem as a relative shape sequence, we are able to correctly identify 42/80 cover songs in the “Covers 80” dataset. By contrast, all other work to date on cover songs exclusively relies on matching note sequences from Chroma derived features."

Thereby, we evaluate the benefits of knowing a piece’s global key for estimating key-related pitch classes. First, we present four automatic key detection systems. We compare their performance on suitable datasets of classical music and optimize the algorithms’ free parameters. Using a second dataset, we evaluate automatic classification into the four style periods Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern. To that end, we calculate global chroma statistics of each audio track. We then split up the tracks according to major and minor keys and circularly shift the chroma histograms with respect to the tonic note. Based on these features, we train two individual classifier models for major and minor keys. We test the efficiency of four chroma extraction algorithms for classification. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of key detection performance on the classification results. Additionally, we compare the key-related chroma features to other chroma-based features. We obtain improved performance when using an efficient key detection method for shifting the chroma histograms."

From the peaceful song for waking up each morning to the traditional song for celebrating a holiday to an up-beat song for enjoying the summer, the relationship between the music and the temporal context is clearly important. For music search and recommendation systems, an understanding of these relationships provides a richer environment to discover and listen. But with the large number of tracks available in music catalogues today, manually labeling track-temporal context associations is difficult, time consuming, and costly. This paper examines track-day contexts with the purpose of identifying relationships with specific music tracks. Improvements are made to an existing method for classifying Christmas tracks and a generalization to the approach is shown that allows automated discovery of music for any day of the year. Analyzing the top 50 tracks obtained from this method for three well-known holidays, Halloween, Saint Patrick’s Day, and July 4th, precision@50 was 95%, 99%, and 73%, respectively."

Hybrid approaches further incorporate additional sources of information in order to improve the quality of the recommendations. In the context of a music streaming service, we present a hybrid model based on matrix factorization techniques that fuses the implicit feedback derived from the users’ listening activity with the tags that users have given to musical items. In contrast to existing work, we introduce a novel approach to exploit tags by performing a weighted factorization of the tagging activity. We evaluate the model for the task of artist recommendation, using the expected percentile rank as metric, extended with confidence intervals to enable the comparison between models. Thus, our contribution is twofold: (1) we introduce a novel model that uses tags to improve music recommendations and (2) we extend the evaluation methodology to compare the performance of different recommender systems."

One popular example is the bar pointer model, which enables joint inference of these rhythmic parameters from a piece of music. While this allows the mutual dependencies between these parameters to be exploited, it also increases the computational complexity of the models. In this paper, we propose a new state-space discretisation and tempo transition model for this class of models that can act as a drop-in replacement and not only increases the beat and downbeat tracking accuracy, but also reduces time and memory complexity drastically. We incorporate the new model into two state-of-the-art beat and meter tracking systems, and demonstrate its superiority to the original models on six datasets."

Compared to the previous mensural Optical Music Recognition (OMR) systems, ours shows not only promising performance in music recognition, but also works as a complete pipeline which integrates both recognition and transcription. There are three main parts in this pipeline: i) region-of-interest detection, ii) music symbol detection and classification, and iii) transcription to modern music. In addition to the output in modern notation, our system can generate a MIDI file as well. It provides an easy platform for the musicologists to analyze old manuscripts. Moreover, it renders these valuable cultural heritage resources available to non-specialists as well, as they can now access such ancient music in a better understandable form."

If the spectral envelope of an isolated sound is represented by an all-pole filter, linear predictive coding (LPC) can be used for filter estimation in the linear-frequency domain. The main problem of LPC is that although only the amplitudes of harmonic partials are reliable samples drawn from the spectral envelope, the whole spectrum is used for filter estimation. To solve this problem, we propose an infinite superimposed discrete all-pole (iSDAP) model that, given a music signal, can estimate an appropriate number of superimposed harmonic structures whose harmonic partials are drawn from a limited number of spectral envelopes. Our nonparametric Bayesian source-filter model is formulated in the log-frequency domain that better suits the frequency characteristics of human audition. Experimental results showed that the proposed model outperformed the counterpart model formulated in the linear frequency domain."

This was a primarily aural tradition, transmitted from performer to performer with few notated sources until the late 20th century. Practitioners routinely combined tune segments to create new tunes and personalized settings of existing tunes. This has resulted in a corpus that exhibits an extreme amount of variation, even among tunes with the same name. In addition, the same tune or tune segment may appear under several different names. Previous attempts at building systems for automated retrieval and ranking of instrumental dance tunes perform well for near-exact matching of tunes, but do not work as well in retrieving and ranking, in order of most to least similar, variants of a tune; especially those with variations as extreme as this particular corpus. In this paper we will describe a new approach capable of ranked retrieval of variant tunes, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a transcribed corpus of incipits."

The proposed method aims at leveraging semantic information present in these biographies, and can be divided in three main steps, namely: (1) entity linking, i.e. detecting mentions to named entities in the text and linking them to an external knowledge base; (2) deriving a knowledge representation from these mentions in the form of a semantic graph or a mapping to a vector-space model; and (3) computing semantic similarity between documents. We test this approach on a corpus of 188 artist biographies and a slightly larger dataset of 2,336 artists, both gathered from Last.fm. The former is mapped to the MIREX Audio and Music Similarity evaluation dataset, so that its similarity judgments can be used as ground truth. For the latter dataset we use the similarity between artists as provided by the Last.fm API. Our evaluation results show that an approach that computes similarity over a graph of entities and semantic categories clearly outperforms a baseline that exploits word co-occurrences and latent factors."

In this paper, we investigate the latter problem with a novel machine learning approach, using techniques from time series data mining. Approximately 1300 pairwise contour segments are extracted from a selection of 20 arias. We then formulate the problem as a supervised machine-learning task of predicting types of pairwise melodic relations based on linguistic tone information. The results give a comparative view of fixed and mixed-effects models that achieved around 70% of maximum accuracy. We discuss the superiority of the current method to that of the unsupervised learning in single-syllable-unit contour analysis of similarity in Beijing Opera."

Song2Quartet allows users to add novelty to listening experience of their favorite songs and gain familiarity with string quartets. Previous work in automatic arrangement of music only used symbolic scores to achieve a particular musical style; our challenge is to also consider audio features of the target popular song. In addition to typical audio music content analysis such as beat and chord estimation, we also use time-frequency spectral analysis in order to better reflect partial phrases of the song in its cover version. Song2Quartet produces a probabilistic network of possible musical notes at every sixteenth note for each accompanying instrument of the quartet by combining beats, chords, and spectrogram from the target song with Markov chains estimated from our corpora of quartet music. As a result, the musical score of the cover version can be generated by finding the optimal paths through these networks. We show that the generated results follow the conventions of classical string quartet music while retaining some partial phrases and chord voicings from the target audio."

The additional training examples help the system to learn invariances that are difficult to build into the model, and improve generalization to unseen data. To the best of our knowledge, this approach has not been systematically explored for music signals. Using the problem of singing voice detection with neural networks as an example, we apply a range of label-preserving audio transformations to assess their utility for music data augmentation. In line with recent research in speech recognition, we find pitch shifting to be the most helpful augmentation method. Combined with time stretching and random frequency filtering, we achieve a reduction in classification error between 10 and 30%, reaching the state of the art on two public datasets. We expect that audio data augmentation would yield significant gains for several other sequence labelling and event detection tasks in music information retrieval."

The architecture replaces hidden Markov models (HMMs) with recurrent neural network (RNN) based language models for modelling temporal dependencies between chords. We demonstrate the ability of feed forward deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn discriminative features directly from a time-frequency representation of the acoustic signal, eliminating the need for a complex feature extraction stage. For the hybrid RNN architecture, inference over the output variables of interest is performed using beam search. In addition to the hybrid model, we propose a modification to beam search using a hash table which yields improved results while reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude, thus making the proposed model suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate our model's performance on a dataset with publicly available annotations and demonstrate that the performance is comparable to existing state of the art approaches for chord recognition."

We use a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm to create 2D music maps of tracks, and augment these with visualisations of probabilistic mappings of selected features and their uncertainty. We evaluated the system in a longitudinal trial in users’ homes over several weeks. Users said they had fun with the interface and liked the casual nature of the playlist generation. Users preferred to generate playlists from a local neighbourhood of the map, rather than from a trajectory, using neighbourhood selection more than three times more often than path selection. Probabilistic highlighting of subjective features led to more focused exploration in mouse activity logs, and 6 of 8 users said they preferred the probabilistic highlighting mode."

This study focuses on structural blending utilising an algorithmic formalisation for conceptual blending applied to harmonic concepts. More specifically, it investigates the ability of the system to produce meaningful blends between harmonic cadences, which arguably constitute the most fundamental harmonic concept. The system creates a variety of blends combining elements of the penultimate chords of two input cadences and it further estimates the expected relationships between the produced blends. Then, a preliminary subjective evaluation of the proposed blending system is presented. A pairwise dissimilarity listening test was conducted using original and blended cadences as stimuli. Subsequent multidimensional scaling analysis produced spatial configurations for both behavioural data and dissimilarity estimations by the algorithm. Comparison of the two configurations showed that the system is capable of making fair predictions of the perceived dissimilarities between the blended cadences. This implies that this conceptual blending approach is able to create perceptually meaningful blends based on self-evaluation of its outcome."

Conventional HPSS methods have focused on temporal continuity of harmonic components and spectral continuity of percussive components. However, it may not be appropriate to use them to separate time-varying harmonic signals such as vocals, vibratos, and glissandos, as they lack in temporal continuity. Based on the observation that the spectral distributions of harmonic and percussive signals differ – i.e., harmonic components have harmonic and sparse structure while percussive components are broadband – we propose an algorithm that successfully separates the rapidly time-varying harmonic signals from the percussive ones by imposing different constraints on the two groups of spectral bases. Experiments with real recordings as well as synthesized sounds show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional methods."

Two sinusoidal models in our earlier work are employed in the above-mentioned system to represent piano tones: the General Model and the Piano Model. The General Model, a variant of sinusoidal modeling, can represent a single tone with high modeling quality, yet it fails to separate mixtures of tones due to the overlapping partials. The Piano Model, on the other hand, is an instrument-specific model tailored for piano. Its modeling quality is lower but it can learn from training data (consisting entirely of isolated tones), resolve the overlapping partials and thus separate the mixtures. We formulate a new hierarchical Bayesian framework to run both Models in the source separation process so that the mixtures with overlapping partials can be separated with high quality. The results show that our proposed system gives robust and accurate separation of piano tone signal mixtures (including octaves) while achieving significantly better quality than those reported in related work done previously."

Savage+Tokyo University of the Arts>JPN>education;Quentin D. Atkinson+Auckland University>NZL>education,"Musics, like languages and genes, evolve through a process of transmission, variation, and selection. Evolution of musical tune families has been studied qualitatively for over a century, but quantitative analysis has been hampered by an inability to objectively distinguish between musical similarities that are due to chance and those that are due to descent from a common ancestor. Here we propose an automated method to identify tune families by adapting genetic sequence alignment algorithms designed for automatic identification and alignment of protein families. We tested the effectiveness of our method against a high-quality ground-truth dataset of 26 folk tunes from four diverse tune families (two English, two Japanese) that had previously been identified and aligned manually by expert musicologists. We tested different combinations of parameters related to sequence alignment and to modeling of pitch, rhythm, and text to find the combination that best matched the ground-truth classifications. The best-performing automated model correctly grouped 100% (26/26) of the tunes in terms of overall similarity to other tunes, identifying 85% (22/26) of these tunes as forming distinct tune families. The success of our approach on a diverse, cross-cultural ground-truth dataset suggests promise for future automated reconstruction of musical evolution on a wide scale."

Another advantage is the decrease of runtime and storage demands. However, sometimes feature selection may lead to “over-optimisation” when data in the optimisation set is too different from data in the independent validation set. In this paper, we extend our previous work on feature selection for music genre recognition and focus on so-called “album effect” meaning that optimised classification models may overemphasize relevant characteristics of particular artists and albums rather than learning relevant properties of genres. For that case we examine the performance of classification models on two validation sets after the optimisation with feature selection: the first set with tracks not used for training and feature selection but randomly selected from the same albums, and the second set with tracks selected from other albums. As it can be expected, the classification performance on the second set decreases. Nevertheless, in almost all cases the feature selection remains beneficial compared to complete feature sets and a baseline using MFCCs, if applied for an ensemble of classifiers, proving robust generalisation performance."

On the first stage, an aggregation process is introduced to perform the temporal alignment between the transcribed melody and the music score (ground truth). This stage implicitly aggregates and links the best combination of the extracted melodic segments with the expected note in the ground truth. On the second stage, a statistical method is used to evaluate the accuracy of each detected sung note. The technique is implemented using a Bayesian classifier, which is trained using an audio dataset containing individual scores provided by a committee of expert listeners. These individual scores were measured at each musical note, regarding the pitch, onset, and offset accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the classification scheme is suitable to be used as an assessment tool, providing useful feedback to the student."

Social jukeboxes are systems that enable social music listening with listeners collaboratively choosing the music to be played. Naturally, because music tastes are diverse, using social jukeboxes often involves conflicting interests. Because of that, virtually all social jukeboxes incorporate conflict management mechanisms. In contrast with their widespread use, however, little attention has been given to evaluating how different conflict management mechanisms function to preserve the positive experience of music listeners. This paper presents an experiment with three conflict management mechanisms and three groups of listeners.

While the proposed models can be adapted to different musical styles, the applicability of these flexible methods so far is limited because the application of exact inference is computationally demanding. More efficient approximate inference algorithms using particle filters (PF) can be developed to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we assume that the type of meter of a piece is known, and use this knowledge to simplify an existing Bayesian model with the goal of incorporating a more diverse observation model. We then propose Particle Filter based inference schemes for both the original model and the simplification. We compare the results obtained from exact and approximate inference in terms of meter tracking accuracy as well as in terms of computational demands. Evaluations are performed using corpora of Carnatic music from India and a collection of Ballroom dances. We document that the approximate methods perform similar to exact inference, at a lower computational cost. Furthermore, we show that the inference schemes remain accurate for long and full length recordings in Carnatic music."

Notably, we find that large groups last longer if they actively alter their membership. Furthermore, such groups tend to cover a wider selection of topics, suggesting that a change of members as well as of research topics increases their adaptability. In turn, smaller groups show the opposite behavior, persisting longer if their membership is altered minimally and focus on a smaller set of topics. Finally, by analyzing the effect of group size and lifespan on research impact, we observed that papers penned by medium sized and long lasting groups tend to have a citation advantage."

This is particularly true of music theatre, where a traditional recording cannot sufficiently capture the ephemeral phenomena unique to each staging. In this paper we introduce a toolkit developed with, and used by, a musicologist throughout a complete multi-day production of Richard Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen. The toolkit is centred on a tablet-based score interface through which the scholar makes notes on the scenic setting of the performance as it unfolds, supplemented by a variety of digital data gathered to structure and index the annotations. We report on our experience developing a system suitable for real-time use by the musicologist, structuring the data for reuse and further investigation using semantic web technologies, and of the practical challenges and compromises of fieldwork within a working theatre.

We test the usefulness of the segmentations produced using selective acquisition learning in a melody classification experiment involving melodies of different cultures. Our results show that the segments produced by our selective learner segmenters substantially improve classification accuracy when compared to segments produced by a non-selective learner segmenter, two local segmentation methods, and two naïve baselines."

The approach brings two previously unexplored concepts to the audio domain: audio bigram distributions, and the use of corpus-relative or “second-order” descriptors. To test the real-world applicability of our method, we present an experiment in which we model song recognition data collected in a widely-played music game. By using the proposed corpus analysis pipeline we are able to present a cognitively adequate analysis that allows a model interpretation in terms of the listening history and experience of our participants. We find that our corpus-based audio features are able to explain a comparable amount of variance to symbolic features for this task when used alone and that they can supplement symbolic features profitably when the two types of features are used in tandem. Finally, we highlight new insights into what makes music recognizable."

Another dataset, the Million Song Dataset (MSD), a collection of features and metadata for one million tracks, unfortunately does not contain readily accessible genre labels. Therefore, multiple attempts have been made to add song-level genre annotations, which are required for supervised machine learning tasks. Thus far, the quality of these annotations has not been evaluated. In this paper we present a method for creating additional genre annotations for the MSD from databases, which contain multiple, crowd-sourced genre labels per song (Last.fm, beaTunes). Based on label co-occurrence rates, we derive taxonomies, which allow inference of top-level genres. These are most often used in MGR systems. We then combine multiple datasets using majority voting. This both promises a more reliable ground truth and allows the evaluation of the newly generated and pre-existing datasets.

The algorithm decomposes the music signal into two dictionaries: a percussive dictionary initialized with pre-defined drum templates and a harmonic dictionary initialized with undeﬁned entries. The harmonic dictionary is adapted to the non-percussive music content in a standard NMF procedure. The percussive dictionary is adapted to each individual signal in an iterative scheme: it is fixed during the decomposition process, and is updated based on the result of the previous convergence. Two template adaptation methods are proposed to provide more flexibility and robustness in the case of unknown data. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated and compared to state of the art systems. The results show that template adaptation improves the transcription performance, and the detection accuracy is in the same range as more complex systems."

Recent research has explored the explicit modeling of characteristic rhythmic patterns as a way to improve upon existing beat-tracking algorithms, which typically fail on dealing with syncopated or polyrhythmic music. This work takes the Uruguayan Candombe drumming (an afro-rooted rhythm from Latin America) as a case study. After analyzing the aspects that make this music genre troublesome for usual algorithmic approaches and describing its basic rhythmic patterns, the paper proposes a supervised scheme for rhythmic pattern tracking that aims at finding the metric structure from a Candombe recording, including beat and downbeat phases. Then it evaluates and compares the performance of the method with those of general-purpose beat-tracking algorithms through a set of experiments involving a database of annotated recordings totaling over two hours of audio. The results of this work reinforce the advantages of tracking rhythmic patterns (possibly learned from annotated music) when it comes to automatically following complex rhythms. A software implementation of the proposal as well as the annotated database utilized are available to the research community with the publication of this paper."

Specifically, we aim to estimate the drummers’ swing ratio in excerpts of jazz recordings taken from the Weimar Jazz Database. A first approach is based on automatic detection of ride cymbal (RC) onsets and evaluation of relative time intervals between them. However, small errors in the onset detection propagate considerably into the swing ratio estimates. As our main technical contribution, we propose to use the log-lag autocorrelation function (LLACF) as a mid-level representation for estimating swing ratios, circumventing the error-prone detection of RC onsets. In our experiments, the LLACF-based swing ratio estimates prove to be more reliable than the ones based on RC onset detection. Therefore, the LLACF seems to be the method of choice to process large amounts of jazz recordings. Finally, we indicate some implications of our method for microtiming studies in jazz research."

However, unlike onset detection, offset detection has seldom been the subject of an in-depth study in the music information retrieval community, possibly because of the ambiguity involved in the determination of offset times in music. This paper presents a preliminary study aiming at discussing ways to annotate and to evaluate offset times for pitched non-percussive instruments. Moreover, we conduct a case study of offset detection in violin recordings by evaluating a number of energy, spectral flux, and pitch based methods using a new dataset covering 6 different violin playing techniques. The new dataset, which is going to be shared with the research community, consists of 63 violin recordings that are thoroughly annotated based on perceptual loudness and note transition. The offset detection methods, which are adapted from well-known methods for onset detection, are evaluated using an onset-aware method we propose for this task. Result shows that the accuracy of offset detection is highly dependent on the playing techniques involved. Moreover, pitch-based methods can better get rid of the soft-decaying behavior of offsets and achieve the best result among others."

Efforts on incorporating content information into collaborative filtering methods have shown success in many non-musical applications, such as scientific article recommendation. Inspired by the related work, we train a neural network on semantic tagging information as a content model and use it as a prior in a collaborative filtering model. Such a system still allows the user listening data to “speak for itself”. The proposed system is evaluated on the Million Song Dataset and shows comparably better result than the collaborative filtering approaches, in addition to the favorable performance in the cold-start case."

Due to data availability, there also has been a strong bias towards analyzing piano performances, in which local timing, dynamics and articulation are important expressive performance features. In this paper, we consider the problem of analyzing multiple performances of the same symphonic piece, performed by different orchestras and different conductors. While differences between interpretations in this genre may include commonly studied features on timing, dynamics and articulation, the timbre of the orchestra and choices of balance within the ensemble are other important aspects distinguishing different orchestral interpretations from one another. While it is hard to model these higher-level aspects as explicit audio features, they can usually be noted visually in spectrogram plots. We therefore propose a method to compare orchestra performances by examining visual spectrogram characteristics. Inspired by eigenfaces in human face recognition, we apply Principal Components Analysis on synchronized performance fragments to localize areas of cross-performance variation in time and frequency. We discuss how this information can be used to examine performer differences, and how beyond pairwise comparison, relative differences can be studied between multiple performances in a corpus at once."

We compare the results of three different strategies for utilising the estimated singing voice signals from four state-of-the-art source separation algorithms. In order to assess the performance of those strategies on an internal data set, we use two different feature sets, each fed to two different classifiers. After selecting the most promising approach, the results on two publicly available data sets are presented. In an additional experiment, we use the improved VD for a simple post-processing technique: For the final estimation of the source signals, we decide to use either silence, or the mixed, or the separated signals, according to the VD. The results of traditionally used BSS evaluation methods suggest that this is useful for both the estimated background signals, as well as for the estimated vocals."

Five feature representations are generated from the same feature set with different scales, including two note-level representations and three segment-level representations of the onset, sustain and offset, and are tested for automatically identifying playing mistakes. Performance is evaluated under the framework of using the Fisher score for feature selection and the support vector machine for classification. Results show that the F-measures using different feature representations can vary up to 20% for two types of playing mistakes. It demonstrates the different sensitivities of each feature representation to different mistakes. Moreover, our results suggest that the standard audio features such as MFCCs are not good enough and more advanced feature design may be needed."

Proposed methodologies focus either on specific aspects of harmony (e.g., generating abstract chord symbols) or incorporate the determination of many harmonic characteristics in a single probabilistic generative scheme. This paper addresses the problem of assigning voice leading focussing on the bass voice, i.e., the realisation of the actual bass pitches of an abstract chord sequence, under the scope of a modular melodic harmonisation system where different aspects of the generative process are arranged by different modules. The proposed technique defines the motion of the bass voice according to several statistical aspects: melody voice contour, previous bass line motion, bass-to-melody distances and statistics regarding inversions and note doublings in chords. The aforementioned aspects of voicing are modular, i.e., each criterion is defined by independent statistical learning tools. Experimental results on diverse music idioms indicate that the proposed methodology captures efficiently the voice layout characteristics of each idiom, whilst additional analyses on separate statistically trained modules reveal distinctive aspects of each idiom. The proposed system is designed to be flexible and adaptable (for instance, for the generation of novel blended melodic harmonisations)."

Instead, the proposed algorithm proceeds iteratively by initially decomposing a part of the time-frequency representation into a combination of a small subset of all possible notes then reinvesting this information in the following step involving a large subset of notes. Specifically, starting with the lowest octave of notes that is of interest, each iteration increases the set of notes under consideration by an octave. The resolution of a lower dimensionality problem used to properly initialize matrices for a more complex problem, results in a gain of some percent in the transcription accuracy."

We noticed that this recognition step can be improved when using singing data in model training, but to our knowledge, there are no large datasets of singing data annotated with phonemes. However, such data does exist for speech. We therefore propose to make phoneme recognition models more robust for singing by training them on speech data that has artificially been made more “song-like”. We test two main modifications on speech data: Time stretching and pitch shifting. Artificial vibrato is also tested. We then evaluate models trained on different combinations of these modified speech recordings. The utilized modeling algorithms are Neural Networks and Deep Belief Networks."

The graph identification problem is cast as an optimization where each potential edge is scored according to its plausibility.

In this work, we propose a novel approach for automatically generating audio mosaics with the objective to preserve the source’s timbre in the mosaic. Inspired by algorithms for non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), our idea is to use update rules to learn an activation matrix that, when multiplied with the spectrogram of the source recording, resembles the spectrogram of the target recording. However, when applying the original NMF procedure, the resulting mosaic does not adequately reflect the source’s timbre. As our main technical contribution, we propose an extended set of update rules for the iterative learning procedure that supports the development of sparse diagonal structures in the activation matrix. We show how these structures better retain the source’s timbral characteristics in the resulting mosaic."

Then, multiple instances of the on-line tracking algorithm (each using a different performance as a reference) are used to follow the live performance, and their output is combined to come up with the current position in the score. As the evaluation shows, this strategy improves both the robustness and the precision, especially on pieces that are generally hard to track (e.g. pieces with extreme, abrupt tempo changes, or orchestral pieces with a high degree of polyphony). Finally, we describe a real-world application, where this music tracking algorithm was used to follow a world-famous orchestra in a concert hall in order to show synchronised visual content (the sheet music, explanatory text and videos) to members of the audience."

Therefore, a person who wants to fully understand the composition suffers from a time-consuming task, which seems almost impossible for a novice of classical music. To integrate the content descriptions obtained from multiple pages, we propose a method for aligning each pair of paragraphs of such descriptions. Using dynamic time warping-based method along with our new ideas, (a) a distribution-based distance measure named w2DD, and (b) the concept of passage expressions, it is possible to align content descriptions of classical music better than when using cutting-edge text analysis methods. Our method can be extended in future studies to create applications systems to integrate descriptions with musical scores and performances."

Unfortunately, there is no common repository that indexes all these data. In this work, information related to flamenco music is gathered from general knowledge bases (e.g., Wikipedia, DBpedia), music encyclopedias (e.g., MusicBrainz), and specialized flamenco websites, and is then integrated into a new knowledge base called FlaBase. As resources from different data sources do not share common identifiers, a process of pair-wise entity resolution has been performed. FlaBase contains information about 1,174 artists, 76 palos (flamenco genres), 2,913 albums, 14,078 tracks, and 771 Andalusian locations. It is freely available in RDF and JSON formats. In addition, a method for entity recognition and disambiguation for FlaBase has been created. The system can recognize and disambiguate FlaBase entity references in Spanish texts with an f-measure value of 0.77. We applied it to biographical texts present in Flabase. By using the extracted information, the knowledge base is populated with relevant information and a semantic graph is created connecting the entities of FlaBase. Artists relevance is then computed over the graph and evaluated according to a flamenco expert criteria. Accuracy of results shows a high degree of quality and completeness of the knowledge base."

Percussion in Indian art music uses onomatopoeic oral mnemonic syllables for the transmission of repertoire and technique. This is utilized for the task of percussion pattern discovery from audio recordings. From a parallel corpus of audio and expert curated scores for 38 tabla solo recordings, we use the scores to build a set of most frequent syllabic patterns of different lengths. From this set, we manually select a subset of musically representative query patterns. To discover these query patterns in an audio recording, we use syllable-level hidden Markov models (HMM) to automatically transcribe the recording into a syllable sequence, in which we search for the query pattern instances using a Rough Longest Common Subsequence (RLCS) approach. We show that the use of RLCS makes the approach robust to errors in automatic transcription, significantly improving the pattern recall rate and F-measure. We further propose possible enhancements to improve the results."

Stochastic modelling has been one of the most successful strategies in this field. We describe the performance as a hierarchical process of performer’s progression in the score and the production of performed notes, and represent the process as an extension of the hidden semi-Markov model. The model is compared with a previously studied model based on hidden Markov model (HMM), and reasons are given that the present model is advantageous for score following especially for scores with trills, tremolos, and arpeggios. This is also confirmed empirically by comparing the accuracy of score following and analysing the errors. We also provide a hybrid of this model and the HMM-based model which is computationally more efficient and retains the advantages of the former model. The present model yields one of the state-of-the-art score following algorithms for symbolic performance and can possibly be applicable for other music recognition problems."

Unlike previous studies which merely generate mashups by overlaying music segments on one single base track, the proposed system creates mashups with multiple background (e.g. instrumental) and lead (e.g. vocal) track segments. So, besides the suitability between the vertically overlaid tracks (i.e. vertical mashability) used in previous studies, we proposed to further consider the suitability between the horizontally connected consecutive music segments (i.e. horizontal mashability) when searching for proper music segments to be combined. On the vertical side, two new factors: “harmonic change balance” and “volume weight” have been considered. On the horizontal side, the methods used in the studies of medley creation are incorporated. Combining vertical and horizontal mashabilities together, we defined four levels of mashability that may be encountered and found the proper solution to each of them. Subjective evaluations showed that the proposed four levels of mashability can appropriately reflect the degrees of listening enjoyment. Besides, by taking the newly proposed vertical mashability measurement into account, the improvement in user satisfaction is statistically significant."

However, typical algorithmic approaches to structural annotation produce flat temporal partitions of a track, which are commonly evaluated against a similarly flat, human-produced annotation. Evaluating structure analysis as represented by flat annotations effectively discards all notions of structural depth in the evaluation. Although collections of hierarchical structure annotations have been recently published, no techniques yet exist to measure an algorithm’s accuracy against these rich structural annotations. In this work, we propose a method to evaluate structural boundary detection with hierarchical annotations. The proposed method transforms boundary detection into a ranking problem, and facilitates the comparison of both flat and hierarchical annotations. We demonstrate the behavior of the proposed method with various synthetic and real examples drawn from the SALAMI dataset."

MIDI guitars are useful tools for various purposes from inputting MIDI data to enjoying a jam session system, but existing MIDI guitars do not have sufficient accuracy in converting the performance to an MIDI form. In this paper, we make an attempt on improving the accuracy of a MIDI guitar by integrating it with an audio transcription method based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). First, we investigate an NMF-based algorithm for transcribing guitar performances. Although the NMF is a promising method, an effective post-process (i.e., converting the NMF’s output to an MIDI form) is a non-trivial problem. We propose use of a neural network for this conversion. Next, we investigate a method for integrating the outputs of the MIDI guitar and NMF. Because they have different tendencies in wrong outputs, we take an policy of outputting only common parts in the two outputs. Experimental results showed that the F-score of our method was 0.626 whereas those of the MIDI-guitar-only and NMF-and-neural-network-only methods were 0.347 and 0.526, respectively."

Shortened versions of three pieces from The Sound of Music were selected: “Edelweiss”, “Do-Re-Mi” and “My Favourite Things”. 39 participants sang three repetitions of each excerpt without accompaniment, resulting in a dataset of 21762 notes in 117 recordings. To obtain pitch estimates we used the Tony software’s automatic transcription and manual correction tools. Pitch accuracy was measured in terms of pitch error and interval error. We show that singers’ pitch accuracy correlates significantly with self-reported singing skill and musical training. Larger intervals led to larger errors, and the tritone interval in particular led to average errors of one third of a semitone. Note duration (or inter-onset interval) had a significant effect on pitch accuracy, with greater accuracy on longer notes. To model drift in the tonal centre over time, we present a sliding window model which reveals patterns in the pitch errors of some singers. Based on the trajectory, we propose a measure for the magnitude of drift: tonal reference deviation (TRD). The data and software are freely available."

The GCT allows the re-arrangement of the notes of a harmonic sonority such that abstract idiom-specific types of chords may be derived. This encoding is inspired by the standard roman numeral chord type labelling and is, therefore, ideal for hierarchic harmonic systems such as the tonal system and its many variations; at the same time, it adjusts to any other harmonic system such as post-tonal, atonal music, or traditional polyphonic systems. In this paper the descriptive potential of the GCT is assessed in the tonal idiom by comparing GCT harmonic labels with human expert annotations (Kostka & Payne harmonic dataset). Additionally, novel methods for grouping and clustering chords, according to their GCT encoding and their functional role in chord sequences, are introduced. The results of both harmonic labelling and functional clustering indicate that the GCT representation constitutes a suitable scheme for representing effectively harmony in computational systems."

Cover song identification has attracted some attention recently.

To better control this decomposition, NMF has been extended using prior knowledge and parametric models. In fact, using score information considerably improved separation results. Nevertheless, one of the main problems of using score information is the misalignment between the score and the actual performance. A potential solution to this problem is the use of audio to score alignment systems. However, most of them rely on a tolerance window that clearly affects the separation results. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method to refine the aligned score at note level by detecting both, onset and offset for each note present in the score. Note refinement is achieved by detecting shapes and contours in the estimated instrument-wise time activation (gains) matrix. Decomposition is performed in a supervised way, using training instrument models and coarsely-aligned score information. The detected contours define time-frequency note boundaries, and they increase the sparsity. Finally, we have evaluated our method for informed source separation using a dataset of Bach chorales obtaining satisfactory results, especially in terms of SIR."

Subsequently, we evaluate standard combination rules for merging these single classifiers into a composite classifier based on global features. We further obtain two higher level classifiers based on chroma features: one based on comparing histograms of quantized chroma features, and a second one based on computing cross-correlations between sequences of chroma features, to account for temporal information. For combining the latter chroma-based classifiers with the composite classifier based on global features, we use standard rank aggregation methods adapted from the information retrieval literature. We evaluate performance with the Second Hand Song dataset, where we quantify performance using multiple statistics. We observe that each combination rule outperforms single methods in terms of the total number of identified queries. Experiments with rank aggregation methods show an increase of up to 23.5 % of the number of identified queries, compared to single classifiers."

When the pedal is pressed, notes played will continue to sound until the string vibration naturally ceases. This makes the notes longer than their notated lengths and overlap with later notes. In this paper, we propose an approach to address this problem. Given that the most competitive wrong score positions for each audio frame are the ones before the correct position due to the sustained sounds, we remove partials of sustained notes and only retain partials of “new notes” in the audio representation. This operation reduces sustain-pedal effects by weakening the match between the audio frame and previous wrong score positions, hence encourages the system to align to the correct score position. We implement this idea based on a state-of-the-art score following framework. Experiments on synthetic and real piano performances from the MAPS dataset show significant improvements on both alignment accuracy and robustness."

While characteristic musical features that define ragtime as a genre have been debated since its inception, musicologists argue that specific syncopation patterns are most typical for this genre. Therefore, we investigate the use of syncopation patterns in the RAG-collection from its beginnings until the present time in this paper. Using computational methods, this paper provides an overview on the use of rhythmical patterns of the ragtime genre, thereby offering valuable new insights that complement musicological hypotheses about this genre. Specifically, we measure the amount of syncopation for each bar using Longuet-Higgins and Lee’s model of syncopation, determine the most frequent rhythmic patterns, and discuss the role of a specific short-long-short syncopation pattern that musicologists argue is characteristic for ragtime. A comparison between the ragtime (pre-1920) and modern (post-1920) era shows that the two eras differ in syncopation pattern use. Onset density and amount of syncopation increase after 1920. Moreover, our study confirms the musicological hypothesis on the important role of the short-long-short syncopation pattern in ragtime. These findings are pivotal in developing ragtime genre-specific features."

Specifically, a discriminative binary classifier is trained to distinguish melodic from non-melodic contours. This classifier is then used to predict likelihoods for a track’s extracted contours, and these scores are decoded to generate a single melody output. The results are compared with the Melodia algorithm and with a generative model used in a previous study. We show that the discriminative model outperforms the generative model in terms of contour classification accuracy, and the melody output from our proposed system performs comparatively to Melodia.

As a result of this procedure, the combined output has around 50% fewer errors when compared to the output of any one OMR program. Image pre-processing splits scores into separate movements and sections and removes ossia staves which confuse OMR software. Post-processing aligns the outputs from different OMR programs and from different sources, rejecting outputs with the most errors and using majority voting to determine the likely correct details.

In this paper, we take an initial step toward bridging these two fields by reviewing studies from the music neuroscience literature, with an emphasis on imaging modalities and analysis techniques that might be of practical interest to the MIR community. We show that certain approaches currently used in a neuroscientific setting align with those used in MIR research, and discuss implications for potential areas of future research. We additionally consider the impact of disparate research objectives between the two fields, and how such a discrepancy may have hindered cross-discipline output thus far. It is hoped that a heightened awareness of this literature will foster interaction and collaboration between MIR and neuroscience researchers, leading to advances in both fields that would not have been achieved independently."
74,Arthur Flexer,Improving Visualization of High-Dimensional Music Similarity Spaces.,2015,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416472,Arthur Flexer+Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence>AUT>facility,Visualizations of music databases are a popular form of interface allowing intuitive exploration of music catalogs. They are often based on lower dimensional projections of high dimensional music similarity spaces. Such similarity spaces have already been shown to be negatively impacted by so-called hubs and anti-hubs. These are points that appear very close or very far to many other data points due to a problem of measuring distances in high-dimensional spaces. We present an empirical study on how this phenomenon impacts three popular approaches to compute two-dimensional visualizations of music databases. We also show how the negative impact of hubs and anti-hubs can be reduced by re-scaling the high dimensional spaces before low dimensional projection.

These descriptors are called identity vectors or i-vectors and are the results of a factor analysis procedure applied on frame-level features. The i-vectors provide a low-dimensional and fixed-length representation for each song and can be used in a supervised and unsupervised manner. First, we use the i-vectors for an unsupervised music similarity estimation, where we calculate the distance between i-vectors in order to predict the genre of songs. Second, for a supervised artist classification task we report the performance measures using multiple classifiers trained on the i-vectors. Standard datasets for each task are used to evaluate our method and the results are compared with the state of the art. By only using timbral information, we already achieved the state of the art performance in music similarity (which uses extra information such as rhythm). In artist classification using timbre descriptors, our method outperformed the state of the art."

Using a collection of Billboard songs with provided ground-truth chord labels, we use established chord identification algorithms to produce a corresponding extracted chord label dataset. We implement methods to compare chord progressions between two songs on the basis of their optimal local alignment scores. We create a set of chord progression comparison parameters defined by chord distance metrics, gap costs, and normalization measures and run a black-box global optimization algorithm to stochastically search for the best parameter set to maximize the rank correlation for two harmonic retrieval tasks across the ground-truth and extracted chord Billboard datasets. The first task evaluates chord progression similarity between all pairwise combinations of songs, separately ranks results for ground-truth and extracted chord labels, and returns a rank correlation coefficient. The second task queries the set of songs with fabricated chord progressions, ranks each query’s results across ground-truth and extracted chord labels, and returns rank correlations. The end results suggest that practical retrieval systems can be constructed to work effectively without the guide of human ground-truthing."

Arpeggiation is a characteristic of musical expression, or expressive timing, in piano performance. However, very few studies have investigated rolled chord performance. In this paper, we investigate two expressive timing properties of piano rolled chords: equivalent onset and onset span. Equivalent onset refers to the hidden onset that can functionally replace the onsets of the notes in a chord; onset span refers to the time interval from the first note onset to the last note onset. We ask two research questions. First, what is the equivalent onset of a rolled chord? Second, are the onset spans of different chords interpreted in the same way? The first question is answered by local tempo estimation while the second question is answered by Analysis of Variance. Also, we contribute a piano duet dataset for rolled chords analysis and other studies on expressive music performance. The dataset contains three pieces of music, each performed multiple times by different pairs of musicians."

Such models predict a probability distribution over the possible values of the next pitch in a sequence, which is obtained by combining the prediction of two components (1) a long-term model (LTM) learned offline on a corpus of melodies, as well as (2) a short-term model (STM) which incorporates context-specific information available during prediction. Both the LTM and the STM learn regularities in pitch sequences solely from data. The models are combined in an ensemble, wherein they are weighted by the relative entropies of their respective predictions. Going by previous work that demonstrates the success of Connectionist LTMs, we employ the recently proposed Recurrent Temporal Discriminative Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RTDRBM) as the LTM here. While it is indeed possible for the same model to also serve as an STM, our experiments showed that n-gram models tended to learn faster than the RTDRBM in an online setting and that the hybrid of an RTDRBM LTM and an n-gram STM gives us the best predictive performance yet on a corpus of monophonic chorale and folk melodies."

While these methods perform effectively due to the minimal assumptions they place on the nature of the sampled pitch temporal trajectories, their practical applicability to retrieval tasks on real-world databases is seriously limited by their prohibitively large computational complexity. While dimensionality reduction of the time-series to discrete symbol strings is a standard approach that can exploit computational gains from the data compression as well as the availability of efficient string matching algorithms, the compressed representation of the pitch time series itself is not well understood given the pervasiveness of pitch inflections in the melodic shape of the raga phrases. We propose methods that are informed by domain knowledge to design the representation and to optimize parameter settings for the subsequent string matching algorithm. The methods are evaluated in the context of an audio query based search for Hindustani vocal compositions in audio recordings via the mukhda (refrain of the song). We present results that demonstrate performance close to that achieved by time-series matching but at orders of magnitude reduction in complexity."

Our idea was to modify the Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP) model in the field of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by (a) introducing new research achievements in psychophysics, and (b) considering the difference between speech and music signals to make it consistent with human hearing and more suitable for music signal analysis. Furthermore, the obtained Linear Prediction Coefficients (LPCs) were mapped to LPC cepstrum coefficients, on which liftering was applied, to boost the timbre invariance of the resultant feature: Modified Perceptual Linear Prediction Liftered Cepstrum (MPLPLC). Experimental results showed that both LPC cepstrum coefficients mapping and cepstrum liftering were crucial in ensuring the identification power of the MPLPLC feature. The MPLPLC feature outperformed state-of-the-art features in the context of CSI and in resisting instrumental accompaniment variation.

In this paper, an attempt is made to mimic the listener. A r¯aga verification framework is therefore suggested. The r¯aga verification system assumes that a specific r¯aga is claimed based on similarity of movements and motivic patterns. The system then checks whether this claimed r¯aga is correct. For every r¯aga, a set of cohorts are chosen. A r¯aga and its cohorts are represented using pallavi lines of compositions. A novel approach for matching, called Longest Common Segment Set (LCSS), is introduced. The LCSS scores for a r¯aga are then normalized with respect to its cohorts in two different ways. The resulting systems and a baseline system are compared for two partitionings of a dataset. A dataset of 30 r¯agas from Charsur Foundation is used for analysis. An equal error rate (EER) of 12% is obtained."

Each instrument may apply to several staves, may be represented with several possible text strings, and may appear at several possible positions relative to the staves. We find the optimal labeling of staves using a globally optimal dynamic programming approach that embeds simple template-based optical character recognition within the overall recognition scheme. When given an entire score, we simultaneously optimize on the text labeling for each system, as well as the character template models, thus adapting to the font at hand. Our implementation alternately optimizes over the text label identification and re-estimates the character templates. Experiments are presented on 10 different scores showing a significant improvement due to adaptation."

Recently, kernel additive modeling with generalized spatial Wiener filtering (GW) was presented for music/voice separation. In this paper, an adaptive auditory filtering based on β-order minimum mean-square error spectral amplitude estimation (bSA) is applied to the kernel additive modeling for improving the singing voice separation performance from monaural music signal. The proposed algorithm is composed of five modules: short time Fourier transform, music/voice separation based on bSA, determination of back-fitting, back-fitting, and inverse short time Fourier transform. In the proposed method, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based factorized spectral amplitude exponent β for each kernel component is adaptively calculated for effective bSA-based auditory filtering performance during kernel back-fitting. Using a back-fitting threshold, the kernel back-fitting process can automatically be iteratively performed until convergence. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better separation performance than GW based on kernel additive modeling."

We hypothesized that genre-preferring subgroups would vary in genre exclusivity, and that their degree of exclusivity would be linearly associated with the openness personality factor (if people have open personalities, they should be “open” to different musical styles). Consistent with our hypothesis, results showed that greater genre inclusivity, i.e. many genres in people’s music collections, positively associated with openness and (unexpectedly) agreeableness, suggesting that individuals with high openness and agreeableness have wider musical tastes than those with low openness and agreeableness.

These results are now reinterpreted by refining the previously proposed metrics. We consider that the perceptual contribution of each beat to the measured similarity is non-homogeneous but might indeed depend on the temporal positions of the beat along the bar. We show that with these improvements, the correlation between the previously evaluated experimental similarity and predictions based on our metrics increases substantially.

Two recent efforts did exactly this for large-vocabulary ACE, but despite arguably achieving some of the highest results to date, both approaches plateau well short of having solved the problem. Therefore, this work explores the behavior of these two high performing systems as a means of understanding obstacles and limitations in chord estimation, arriving at four critical observations: one, music recordings that invalidate tacit assumptions about harmony and tonality result in erroneous and even misleading performance; two, standard lexicons and comparison methods struggle to reflect the natural relationships between chords; three, conventional approaches conflate the competing goals of recognition and transcription to some undefined degree; and four, the perception of chords in real music can be highly subjective, making the very notion of “ground truth” annotations tenuous. Synthesizing these observations, this paper offers possible remedies going forward, and concludes with some perspectives on the future of both ACE research and the field at large."

The proposed complexity weighting accounts for the differences in the melodic complexities of the phrases, a crucial aspect known to distinguish phrases in Carnatic music. For evaluation we use over 5 hours of audio data comprising 625 annotated melodic phrases belonging to 10 different phrase categories. Results show that the proposed melodic abstraction and complexity weighting schemes significantly improve the phrase detection accuracy, and that tetrachord normalization is a successful strategy for dealing with transposed phrase occurrences in Carnatic music.

Then, we apply dynamic time warping between the phrase and audio to estimate candidate audio segments in the given audio recording. Next, the retrieved audio segments are ranked by means of a novel score-informed hidden Markov model, in which durations of the syllables within a phrase are explicitly modeled. The proposed approach is evaluated on 12 a-capella audio recordings of Turkish Makam music. Relying on standard speech phonetic models, we arrive at promising results that outperform a baseline approach unaware of lyrics durations.

As input, a variable-Q transform (VQT) time-frequency representation is used. Computational efficiency is achieved by supporting the use of pre-extracted and pre-shifted sound state templates. Two variants are presented: without temporal constraints and with hidden Markov model-based constraints controlling the appearance of sound states. Experiments are performed on benchmark transcription datasets: MAPS, TRIOS, MIREX multiF0, and Bach10; results on multi-pitch detection and instrument assignment show that the proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art for multiple-instrument transcription and is more than 20 times faster compared to a previous sound state-based model.

Specifically, we treat the task as a time sequence pattern recognition problem, and develop a two-stage framework for detecting five fundamental playing techniques used by the electric guitar. Given an audio track, the first stage identifies prominent candidates by analyzing the extracted melody contour, and the second stage applies a pre-trained classifier to the candidates for playing technique detection using a set of timbre and pitch features. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on a new dataset comprising of 42 electric guitar solo tracks without accompaniment, each of which covers 10 to 25 notes.

Furthermore, we also evaluate the performance of the proposed framework for bend detection in five studio mixtures, to discuss how it can be applied in transcribing real-world electric guitar solos with accompaniment."

Kirlin+Rhodes College>USA>education|Unknown>Unknown>Unknown;David L. Thomas+Rhodes College>USA>education|Unknown>Unknown>Unknown,"Computers are now powerful enough and data sets large enough to enable completely data-driven studies of Schenkerian analysis, the most well-established variety of hierarchical music analysis. In particular, we now have probabilistic models that can be trained via machine learning algorithms to analyze music in a hierarchical fashion as a music theorist would. Most of these models, however, only analyze the monophonic melodic content of the music, as opposed to taking all of the musical voices into account. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of extending a probabilistic model developed for analyzing monophonic music to function with homophonic music. We present details of the new model, an algorithm for determining the most probable analysis of the music, and a number of experiments evaluating the quality of the analyses predicted by the model. We also describe how varying the way the model interprets rests in the input music affects the resulting analyses produced."

In this context, we argue that a MIR perspective may be used to highlight, in particular, relations between dynamics and various properties of mainstream music. We illustrate this claim with two results obtained from a diachronic analysis performed on 7200 tracks released between 1967 and 2014. This analysis suggests that 1) the so-called “loudness war” has peaked in 2007, and 2) its influence has been important enough to override the impact of genre on dynamics. In other words, dynamics in mainstream music are primarily related to a track’s year of release, rather than to its genre."

In these theme and variation sets, comparable harmonic structures are realized in different ways. This facilitates an evaluation of the effectiveness of automatic analysis algorithms in generalizing across different musical textures. The pieces are encoded in standard **kern format, with analyses jointly encoded using an extension to **kern. The harmonic content of the music was analyzed with both Roman numerals and function labels in duplicate by two different expert analyzers. The pieces are divided into musical phrases, allowing for multiple-levels of automatic analysis, including chord labeling and phrase parsing. This paper describes the content of the dataset in detail, including the types of chords represented, and discusses the ways in which the analyzers sometimes disagreed on the lower-level harmonic content (the Roman numerals) while converging at similar high-level structures (the function of the chords within the phrase)."

In this paper, a novel exploitation of Benford’s law for the analysis of audio signals is proposed. Three new audio features based on the evaluation of the degree of agreement of a certain audio dataset to Benford’s law are presented. These new proposed features are successfully tested in two concrete audio tasks: the detection of artificially assembled chords and the estimation of the quality of the MIDI conversions."

The proposed framework has two separated stages: preprocessing and alignment. In the first stage, we use Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to learn spectral patterns (i.e. basis functions) associated to each combination of concurrent notes in the score. In the second stage, a low latency signal decomposition method with fixed spectral patterns per combination of notes is used over the magnitude spectrogram of the input signal resulting in a divergence matrix that can be interpreted as the cost of the matching for each combination of notes at each frame. Finally, a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approach has been used to find the path with the minimum cost and then determine the relation between the performance and the musical score times. Our framework have been evaluated using a dataset of baroque-era pieces and compared to other systems, yielding solid results and performance."

In particular, we propose the use of sound source separation techniques as a preprocessing step of the mixing process. In addition to an initial solo and accompaniment separation step, the proposed mixing framework is composed of six processing blocks: harmonic-percussive separation (HPS), cross-adaptive multi-track scaling (CAMTS), cross-adaptive equalizer (CAEQ), cross-adaptive dynamic spectral panning (CADSP), automatic excitation (AE), and time-frequency selective panning (TFSP). The effects of the different processing steps in the final quality of the mix are evaluated through a listening test procedure. The results show that the desired quality improvements in terms of sound balance, transparency, stereo impression, timbre, and overall impression can be achieved with the proposed framework."

This is a challenging problem due to the soft nature of onsets and short durations of ornaments. The proposed automatic transcription system is based on hidden Markov models, with separate models being built for notes and for single-note ornaments. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are employed to represent the acoustic signal. Different setups of parameters in feature extraction and acoustic modelling are explored. Experimental evaluations are performed on monophonic flute recordings from Grey Larsen’s CD. The performance of the system is evaluated in terms of the transcription of notes as well as detection of onsets. It is demonstrated that the proposed system can achieve a very good note transcription and onset detection performance. Over 28% relative improvement in terms of the F-measure is achieved for onset detection in comparison to conventional onset detection methods based on signal energy and fundamental frequency."

These stimuli were selected from different genres and systematically vary along musical dimensions such as meter, tempo and the presence of lyrics. This way, various retrieval scenarios can be addressed and the success of classifying based on specific dimensions can be tested.

In this paper we discuss the problems associated with this approach and propose to move to bigger time resolutions when tracking emotion over time. We argue that it is more natural from the listener’s point of view to regard emotional variation in music as a progression of emotionally stable segments. In order to enable such tracking of emotion over time it is necessary to segment music at the emotional boundaries. To address this problem we conduct a formal evaluation of different segmentation methods as applied to a task of emotional boundary detection. We collect emotional boundary annotations from three annotators for 52 musical pieces from the RWC music collection that already have structural annotations from the SALAMI dataset. We investigate how well structural segmentation explains emotional segmentation and find that there is a large overlap, though about a quarter of emotional boundaries do not coincide with structural ones. We also study inter-annotator agreement on emotional segmentation. Lastly, we evaluate different unsupervised segmentation methods when applied to emotional boundary detection and find that, in terms of F-measure, the Structural Features method performs best."

Three systems were evaluated based on five criteria. This paper reports the results of GC14UX, with a special focus on the qualitative analysis of 99 free text responses collected from evaluators. The analysis revealed additional user opinions, not fully captured by score ratings on the given criteria, and demonstrated the challenge of evaluating a variety of systems with different user goals.

All submissions include a MusicBrainz identifier allowing them to be linked to various sources of editorial information. The feature extractor is based on the open source Essentia audio analysis library. From the data submitted by the community, we run classifiers aimed at adding musically relevant semantic information. These classifiers can be developed by the community using tools available on the AcousticBrainz website. All data in AcousticBrainz is freely available and can be accessed through the website or API.

The goal of this study was to explore which components of the decision process are affected when exposed to music; we do so within the context of a stochastic sequential model of simple decisions, the drift-diffusion model (DDM). In our experiment, participants decided whether words were emotionally positive or negative while listening to music that was chosen to induce positive or negative mood. The behavioral results show that the music manipulation was effective, as participants were biased to label words positive in the positive music condition. The DDM shows that this bias was driven by a change in the starting point of evidence accumulation, which indicates an a priori response bias. In contrast, there was no evidence that music affected how participants evaluated the emotional content of the stimuli. To better understand the correspondence between auditory features and decision-making, we proceeded to study how individual aspects of music affect response patterns. Our results have implications for future studies of the connection between music and mood."

In this paper we present such an approach, and apply it to the development of technological applications to enrich classical symphonic concerts. A user-driven approach is particularly important in this area, as orchestras need to innovate the concert experience to meet the needs and expectations of younger generations without alienating the current audience. We illustrate this approach with the results of five focus groups for three audience segments, which allow us to formulate informed user requirements for classical concert applications."

Therefore, a deeper understanding of the workings of these factors is critical for advanced expressive synthesis and computer-aided music education. In this paper, we propose the novel task of automatic expressive musical term classification as a direct means to study the interpretational factors. Specifically, we consider up to 10 expressive musical terms, such as Scherzando and Tranquillo, and compile a new dataset of solo violin excerpts featuring the realization of different expressive terms by different musicians for the same set of classical music pieces. Under a score-informed scheme, we design and evaluate a number of note-level features characterizing the interpretational aspects of music for the classification task. Our evaluation shows that the proposed features lead to significantly higher classification accuracy than a baseline feature set commonly used in music information retrieval tasks. Moreover, taking the contrast of feature values between an expressive and its corresponding non-expressive version (if given) of a music piece greatly improves the accuracy in classifying the presented expressive one. We also draw insights from analyzing the feature relevance and the class-wise accuracy of the prediction."

After splitting the audio into a solo and a backing track, a reference tuning frequency is estimated from the backing track. Next, we compute the fundamental frequency contour for each tone in the solo and a set of features describing its temporal shape. Based on this data, we first investigate, whether the tuning frequencies of jazz recordings changed over the decades of the last century. Second, we analyze whether the intonation is artist-specific. Finally, we examine how the modulation frequency of vibrato tones depends on contextual parameters such as pitch, duration, and tempo as well as the performing artist."
