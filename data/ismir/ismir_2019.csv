Kinnaird+Smith College>USA>education,"The MIR community faces unique challenges in terms of data access, due in large part to country-specific copyright laws. As a result, there is an emerging divide in the MIR research community between labs that have access to music through large companies with abundant funds, and independent labs at smaller institutions who do not have such expansive access. This paper explores how independent researchers have worked to overcome limitations of access to music data without contributing to the crisis of reproducibility.  Acknowledging that there is no single solution for every data access problem that smaller labs face, we propose a number of possibilities for how the MIR community can bridge the gap between advancements from large companies and those within academia. As MIR looks towards the next 20 years, democratizing and expanding access to MIR research and music data is critical. Future solutions could include a  distributed MIREX system, an API designed for MIR researchers, and community-led advocacy to stakeholders."

Often, a single music recording is used as representative of a ""song"" even though different performances of the same song may reveal different properties. A performance is distinct in many ways from a (arguably more abstract) representation of a ""song,"" ""piece,"" or musical score. The characteristics of the (recorded) performance -as opposed to the score or musical idea- can have a major impact on how a listener perceives music. The analysis of music performance, however, has been traditionally only a peripheral topic for the MIR research community. This paper surveys the field of Music Performance Analysis (MPA) from various perspectives, discusses its significance to the field of MIR, and points out opportunities for future research in this field."

Therefore, already the first edition of ISMIR in the year 2000 called for papers addressing the topic of ""User interfaces for music IR"". Since then, the way humans interact with technology to access and listen to music has substantially changed, not least driven by the advances of MIR and related research fields such as machine learning and recommender systems.   In this paper, we reflect on the evolution of MIR-driven user interfaces for music browsing and discovery over the past two decades. We argue that three major developments have transformed and shaped user interfaces during this period, each connected to a phase of new listening practices: first, connected to personal music collections, intelligent audio processing and content description algorithms that facilitate the automatic organization of repositories and finding music according to sound qualities; second, connected to collective web platforms, the exploitation of user-generated metadata pertaining to semantic descriptions; and third, connected to streaming services, the collection of online music interaction traces on a large scale and their exploitation in recommender systems.  We review and contextualize work from ISMIR and related venues from all three phases and extrapolate current developments to outline possible scenarios of music recommendation and listening interfaces of the future."

We furthermore attempt to frame current directions in the field in order to establish some perspective for future research."

This intrinsically cannot handle unseen labels such as newly added music genres or semantic words that users arbitrarily choose for music retrieval. Zero-shot learning can address this problem by leveraging an additional semantic space of labels where auxiliary information about the labels is used to unveil the relationship between each other.  In this work, we investigate the zero-shot learning in music domain and organize two different setups of auxiliary information. One is using human-labeled attribute information based on Free Music Archive and OpenMIC-2018 datasets. The other is using general word semantic information based on Million Song Dataset and Last.fm tag annotations.  Considering a music track is usually multi-labeled in music classification and tagging datasets, we also propose a data split scheme and associated evaluation settings for the multi-label zero-shot learning.  Finally, we report experimental results and discuss the effectiveness and new possibilities of zero-shot learning in music domain."

Recent advances in deep learning have turned typical OMR obstacles into clearly solvable problems, especially the stages that visually process the input image, such as staff line removal or detection of music-notation objects. However, merely detecting objects is not enough for retrieving the actual content, as music notation is a configurational writing system where the semantic of a primitive is defined by its relationship to other primitives. Thus, OMR systems must employ a notation assembly stage to infer such relationships among the detected objects. So far, this stage has been addressed by devising a set of predefined rules or grammars, which hardly generalize well. In this work, we formulate the notation assembly stage from a set of detected primitives as a machine learning problem. Our notation assembly is modeled as a graph that stores syntactic relationships among primitives, which allows us to capture the configuration of symbols in a music-notation document. Our results over the handwritten sheet music corpus MUSCIMA++ show 95.2% precision, 96.0% recall, and an F-score of 95.6% in establishing the correct syntactic relationships. When inferring relationships on data from a music object detector, the model achieves 93.2% precision, 91.5% recall and an F-score of 92.3%."

Datasets for polyphonic instrument recognition can be categorized into roughly two categories. Some, such as MedleyDB, have strong per-frame instrument activity annotations but are usually small in size. Other, larger datasets such as OpenMIC only have weak labels, i.e., instrument presence or absence is annotated only for long snippets of a song. We explore an attention mechanism for handling weakly labeled data for multi-label instrument recognition. Attention has been found to perform well for other tasks with weakly labeled data. We compare the proposed attention model to multiple models which include a baseline binary relevance random forest, recurrent neural network, and fully connected neural networks. Our results show that incorporating attention leads to an overall improvement in classification accuracy metrics across all 20 instruments in the OpenMIC dataset. We find that attention enables models to focus on (or 'attend to') specific time segments in the audio relevant to each instrument label leading to interpretable results."

Rather than using optical music recognition to bridge the gap between sheet music and MIDI, we explore an alternative approach: projecting the MIDI data into pixel space and performing alignment in the image domain.  Our method converts the MIDI data into a crude representation of the score that only contains rectangular floating notehead blobs, a process we call bootleg score synthesis.  Furthermore, we project sheet music images into the same bootleg space by applying a deep watershed notehead detector and filling in the bounding boxes around each detected notehead.  Finally, we align the bootleg representations using a simple variant of dynamic time warping.  On a dataset of 68 real scanned piano scores from IMSLP and corresponding MIDI performances, our method achieves a 97.3% accuracy at an error tolerance of one second, outperforming several baseline systems that employ optical music recognition."

However, when it comes to datasets, there is usually little guarantee that researchers are using the exact same data in the same way, which among other issues, makes comparisons of different methods on the ""same"" datasets problematic.  In this paper, we first show how (often unknown) differences in datasets can lead to significantly different experimental results. We propose a solution to these problems in the form of an open source library, mirdata, which handles datasets in their current distribution modes, but controls for possible variability. In particular, it contains tools which: (1) validate if the user's data (e.g. audio, annotations) is consistent with a canonical version of the dataset; (2) load annotations in a consistent manner; (3) download or give instructions for obtaining data; and (4) make it easy to perform track metadata-specific analysis."

Original algorithms proposed for this task have proven their accuracy on small datasets, but are unable to scale up to modern real-life audio corpora. On the other hand, faster approaches designed to process thousands of pairwise comparisons resulted in lower accuracy, making them unsuitable for practical use.  In this work, we propose a neural network architecture that is trained to represent each track as a single embedding vector. The computation burden is therefore left to the embedding extraction -- that can be conducted offline and stored, while the pairwise comparison task reduces to a simple Euclidean distance computation. We further propose to extract each track's embedding out of its dominant melody representation, obtained by another neural network trained for this task. We then show that this architecture improves state-of-the-art accuracy both on small and large datasets, and is able to scale to query databases of thousands of tracks in a few seconds."

Methodologically, such movement cues have been treated as distinct, isolated events. Yet as practicing musicians and music pedagogues know, conductors' expressive instructions are highly flexible and dependent on the musical context. We seek to demonstrate an approach to search for effective descriptors to express musical features in conducting movement in a valid music context, and to extract complex expressive semantics from elementary conducting kinematic variations. This study therefore proposes a multi-task learning model to jointly identify dynamic, articulation, and phrasing cues from conducting kinematics. A professional conducting movement dataset is compiled using a high-resolution motion capture system. The ReliefF algorithm is applied to select significant features from conducting movement, and recurrent neural network (RNN) is implemented to identify multiple movement cues. The experimental results disclose key elements in conducting movement which communicate musical expressiveness; the results also highlight the advantage of multi-task learning in the complete musical context over single-task learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use recurrent neural network to explore multiple semantic expressive cuing in conducting movement kinematics."

Disagreements about these judgments have led to extensive theoretical debates and ongoing controversies. Such debates are exacerbated by the absence of a pubic corpus of expert Roman numeral analyses, and by the more fundamental lack of an agreed-upon, computer-readable syntax in which those analyses might be expressed. This paper specifies such a standard, along with an associated code library in music21, and a preliminary set of example corpora. To frame the project, we review some of the motivations for doing harmonic analysis, some reasons why it resists automation, and some prospective uses for our tools."

For efficient comparison, cross-source navigation is essential, enabling to quickly jump back and forth between multiple sources without losing the current musical position. In practice, measures are first annotated by hand in the individual source images and then related to each other. Our approach automates this time-consuming and error-prone process with the help of deep learning. For this purpose, we train a neural network that automatically finds bounding boxes of all measures in images. A second network is trained to compute the similarity between two measures to determine if they have the same musical content and should, therefore, be linked for navigation. Sequences of outputs from the second network are matched using Dynamic Time Warping to provide the final proposal of measure relationships, so-called concordances. In addition to cross-source navigation, the results can be used to spot structural differences across the sources which are essential for editorial work, so that musicologists can focus more on analytical tasks."

Although there are various systems for music retrieval based on the similarity between songs or artists and for music browsing based on visualized songs, it is still difficult to explore unfamiliar content by flexibly combining multiple musical aspects. Query-by-Blending overcomes this difficulty by representing each of the aspects as a latent vector representation (called a ""flavor"" in this paper) that is a distinctive quality felt to be characteristic of a given word/song/artist. By giving a lyric word as a query, for example, a user can find songs and artists whose flavors are similar to the flavor of the query word.  Moreover, by giving a query combining (blending) lyric-word and song-audio flavors, the user can interactively explore unfamiliar content containing the blended flavor. This multi-aspect blending was achieved by constructing a novel vector space model into which all of the lyric words, song audio tracks, and artist IDs of a collection can be embedded. In our experiments, we embedded 14,505 lyric words, 433,936 songs, and 44,696 artists into the same shared vector space and found that the system can appropriately calculate similarities between different aspects and blend flavors to find related lyric words, songs, and artists."

Kinnaird+Smith College>USA>education,"Structural segmentation is the task of partitioning a recording into non-overlapping time intervals, and labeling each segment with an identifying marker such as A, B, or verse. Hierarchical structure annotation expands this idea to allow an annotator to segment a song with multiple levels of granularity. While there has been recent progress in developing evaluation criteria for comparing two hierarchical annotations of the same recording, the existing methods have known deficiencies when dealing with inexact label matchings and sequential label repetition.  In this article, we investigate methods for automatically enhancing structural annotations by inferring (and expanding) hierarchical information from the segment labels. The proposed method complements existing techniques for comparing hierarchical structural annotations by coarsening or refining labels with variation markers to either collapse similarly labeled segments together, or separate identically labeled segments from each other. Using the multi-level structure annotations provided in the SALAMI dataset, we demonstrate that automatic hierarchy expansion allows structure comparison methods to more accurately assess similarity between annotations."

In this work, we introduce the Conditioned-U-Net (C-U-Net) which adds a control mechanism to the standard U-Net. The control mechanism allows us to train a unique and generic U-Net to perform the separation of various instruments. The C-U-Net decides the instrument to isolate according to a one-hot-encoding input vector. The input vector is embedded to obtain the parameters that control Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers. FiLM layers modify the U-Net feature maps in order to separate the desired instrument via affine transformations. The C-U-Net performs different instrument separations, all with a single model achieving the same performances as the dedicated ones at a lower cost."

To examine and automate the task of musical schemata classification, we developed a novel musical schemata classifier. First, we tested methods for exact and approximate matching of user-defined schemata prototypes, to establish the notions of identity and similarity between composite music patterns. Next, we examined methods for schemata prototype extraction from collections of same-labelled annotated examples, performing training and testing sessions similar to supervised learning approaches. The performance of the above tasks was verified using the same annotated dataset of 40 keyboard sonata excerpts from pre-Classical and Classical periods.

We then examine the temporal evolution of complexity, reporting consistent changes across decades, such as a decrease in average loudness complexity since the 1960s, and an increase in timbre complexity overall but not for popular songs. We also show, in contrast to claims that popular songs sound more alike over time, that they are not more similar than they were 50 years ago in terms of pitch or rhythm, although similarity in timbre shows distinctive patterns across eras and similarity in loudness has been increasing.

A typical solution to this problem is a proposed orchestral score where candidate scores are ranked by similarity in some feature space between the target sound and the mixture of audio samples in the database corresponding to the notes in the score; in the orchestral setting, valid scores may contain dozens of instruments sounding simultaneously.  Generally, target-based assisted orchestration systems consist of a combinatorial optimization algorithm and a constraint solver that are jointly optimized to find valid solutions.  A key step in the optimization involves generating a large number of combinations of sounds from the database and then comparing the features of each mixture of sounds with the target sound.  Because of the high computational cost required to synthesize a new audio file and then compute features for every combination of sounds, in practice, existing systems instead estimate the features of each new mixture using precomputed features of the individual source files making up the combination.  Currently, state of the art systems use a simple linear combination to make these predictions, even if the features in use are not themselves linear.  In this work, we explore neural models for estimating the features of a mixture of sounds from the features of the component sounds, finding that standard features can be estimated with accuracy significantly better than that of the methods currently used in assisted orchestration systems.  We present quantitative comparisons and discuss the implications of our findings for target-based orchestration problems."

However, this method is problematic due to the limited human ability to temporally align taps with audio cues for beats accurately. In order to create accurate beat annotations, it is therefore typically necessary to manually correct the recorded taps in a subsequent step, which is a cumbersome task. In this work we aim to automate this correction step by ""snapping"" the taps to close-by audio cues - a strategy that is often used by beat tracking algorithms to refine their beat estimates. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. First, we formalize the automated correction procedure mathematically. Second, we introduce a novel visualization method that serves as a tool to analyze the results of the correction procedure for potential errors. Third, we present a new dataset consisting of beat annotations for 101 music recordings. Fourth, we use this dataset to perform a listening experiment as well as a quantitative study to show the effectiveness of our snapping procedure."

We introduce a dataset, which contains monophonic and polyphonic data, both in symbolic and audio representations. We suggest a standardized evaluation procedure to compare algorithmic musical predictions. We compare two neural network models to a baseline model and show that algorithmic approaches can correctly predict about a third of a monophonic segment, and around half of a polyphonic segment, with one of the neural network models achieving best results. However, other approaches to algorithmic music prediction are needed to achieve a more rounded picture of the potential of state-of-the-art methods of music prediction."

Quantitative and qualitative results on synthesized piano data indicate that this attention increases the robustness of the retrieval system by focusing on different parts of the input representation based on the tempo of the audio. Encouraged by these results, we argue for the potential of attention models as a very general tool for many MIR tasks."

The expert performer and researcher of the Moroccan tradition of this music, Amin Chaachoo, is developing a theory, whose last formulation was recently published in La Mu-sique Hispano-Arabe, al-Ala (2016), which argues that centonization, a melodic composition technique used in Gregorian chant, was also utilized for the creation of this repertoire. In this paper we aim to contribute to Chaachoo's theory by means of tf-idf analysis. A highorder n-gram model is applied to a corpus of 149 prescriptive transcriptions of heterophonic recordings, representing each as an unordered multiset of patterns. Computing the tf-idf statistic of each pattern in this corpus provides a means by which we can rank and compare motivic content across nawabāt, distinct musical forms of the tradition. For each nawba, an empirical comparison is made between patterns identified as significant via our approach and those proposed by Chaachoo. Ultimately we observe considerable agreement between the two pattern sets and go further in proposing new, unique and as yet undocumented patterns that occur at least as frequently and with at least as much importance as those in Chaachoo's proposals."

However, modeling this aspect in MIR systems has been notoriously challenging since emotion is an inherently abstract and subjective experience, thus making it difficult to quantify or predict in the first place, and to make sense of the predictions in the next. In an attempt to create a model that can give a musically meaningful and intuitive explanation for its prediction, we propose a VGG-style deep neural network that learns to predict emotional characteristics of a musical piece together with (and based on) human-interpretable, mid-level perceptual features. We compare this to predicting emotion directly with an identical network that does not take into account the mid-level features, and observe that the cost of going through the mid-level features is surprisingly low, on average. The design of our network allows us to visualize the effects of perceptual features on individual emotion predictions, and we argue that the small loss in performance in going through the mid-level features is justified by the gain in explainability of the predictions."

In this paper, we introduce an ensemble-based method that approaches the problem from a many-to-many perspective.  Instead of considering pairs of tracks in isolation, we consider larger sets of potential versions for a given composition, and create and exploit the graph of relationships between these tracks. We show that this can result in a significant improvement in performance, in particular when the number of existing versions of a given composition is large."

Computational approaches to such structural analysis are still challenging, owing to the fact that the boundary between different harmonic states (such as chord functions) is not explicitly defined in the audio or symbolic music data. It is a novel approach to improve chord recognition by jointly identifying chord change using end-to-end sequence learning. In this paper, we propose the Harmony Transformer, a multi-task music harmony analysis model aiming to improve chord recognition through incorporating chord segmentation into the recognition process. The integration of chord segmentation and chord recognition is implemented with the Transformer, a deep sequential learning model yielding fruitful results in the field of natural language processing. A non-autoregressive decoding framework is also adopted here in aid of concatenating the two highly correlated tasks. Experiments of both chord symbol recognition and functional harmony recognition on audio and symbolic datasets demonstrate that explicitly learning the hierarchical structural information of musical data can facilitate and improve the harmony recognition."

Here we propose a solid statistical approach based on a homogeneity-, repetitiveness-, and regularity-aware hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model. The higher-level semi-Markov chain represents a sequence of sections that tend to have regularly spaced boundaries. The timbral features in each section are assumed to follow emission distributions that are homogeneous over time. The lower-level left-to-right Markov chain in each section represents a chord sequence whose sequential order is constrained to be a repetition of a chord sequence in another section of the same cluster. The whole model can be trained unsupervisedly based on Bayesian sparse learning where unnecessary sections automatically degenerate. The proposed method outperformed representative methods in segmentation and clustering accuracies with estimated sections having similar statistical properties as the ground truth data."

In this paper, we analyze intonation deficiencies by introducing an intonation cost measure that can be computed from choir recordings and may help to assess the singers' intonation quality. With our approach, we measure the deviation between the recording's local salient frequency content and an adaptive reference grid based on the equal-tempered scale. The adaptivity introduces invariance of the local intonation measure to global intonation drifts. In our experiments, we compute this measure for several recordings of Anton Bruckner's choir piece Locus Iste. We demonstrate the robustness of the proposed measure by comparing scenarios of different complexity regarding the availability of aligned scores and multi-track recordings, as well as the number of singers per part. Even without using score information, our cost measure shows interesting trends, thus indicating the potential of our method for real-world applications."

Previous approaches to automatic tablature transcription break the problem into two steps: 1) polyphonic pitch estimation, followed by 2) tablature fingering arrangement. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we can jointly solve both steps by learning a mapping directly from audio data to tablature. The model can simultaneously leverage physical playability constraints and differences in string timbres implicit in the data to determine the actual fingerings being used by the guitarist. We propose TabCNN, a CNN for estimating guitar tablature from audio of a solo acoustic guitar performance.

First, the number of publicly available datasets for this task is limited, and there is no publicly available benchmark set that is widely used among researchers for comparative algorithm evaluation.

O’Donnell+McGill University>CAN>education;Martin Rohrmeier+École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne>CHE>education,"Music is hierarchically structured, both in how it is perceived by listeners and how it is composed. Such structure can be captured elegantly using probabilistic grammatical models similar to those used to study natural language. They address the complexity of the structure using abstract categories in a recursive formalism. Most existing grammatical models of musical structure focus on one single dimension of music--such as melody, harmony, or rhythm. While these grammar models often work well on short musical excerpts, accurate analysis of longer pieces requires taking into account the constraints from multiple domains of structure. The present paper proposes abstract product grammars--a formalism which integrates multiple dimensions of musical structure into a single grammatical model--along with efficient parsing and inference algorithms for this formalism. We use this model to study the combination of hierarchically-structured harmonic syntax and hierarchically-structured rhythmic information. The latter is modeled by a novel grammar of rhythm that is capable of expressing temporal regularities in musical phrases. It integrates grouping structure and meter. The combined model of harmony and rhythm outperforms both single-dimension models in computational experiments. All models are trained and evaluated on a treebank of hand-annotated Jazz standards."

Consequently, the designed model is capable of generating several measures of music to connect two musical excerpts. The capabilities and performance of the model are showcased by comparison with competitive baselines using several objective and subjective evaluation methods.

First attempts have been made to analyze tonal properties (e. g., harmonic and melodic intervals) based on fundamental frequency (F0) trajectories. One major challenge in F0-based tonal analysis is introduced by unstable regions in the trajectories due to pitch slides and other frequency fluctuations. In this paper, we describe two approaches for detecting stable regions in frequency trajectories: the first algorithm uses morphological operations inspired by image processing, and the second one is based on suitably defined binary time–frequency masks. To avoid undesired distortions in subsequent analysis steps, both approaches keep the original F0-values unmodified, while only removing F0-values in unstable trajectory regions. We evaluate both approaches against manually annotated stable regions and discuss their potential in the context of interval analysis for traditional three-part Georgian singing."

Introducing invertibility enables the practitioner to directly inspect what the discriminative model has learned, and exactly determine which inputs lead to which outputs. For the task of transcribing polyphonic audio into symbolic form, these models may be especially useful as they allow us to observe, for instance, to what extent the concept of single notes could be learned from a corpus of polyphonic music alone (which has been identified as a serious problem in recent research). This is an entirely new approach to audio transcription, which first of all necessitates some groundwork. In this paper, we begin by looking at the simplest possible invertible transcription model, and then thoroughly investigate its properties. Finally, we will take first steps towards a more sophisticated and capable version. We use the task of piano transcription, and specifically the MAPS dataset, as a basis for these investigations."

Of these previous approaches, only constraint programming has led to a successful solution. Unfortunately, this solution is expensive in terms of computation time. We present here two new search heuristics and a modification to a previously proposed heuristic, that, when applied to a greedy backtracking algorithm, allow the all-partition array problem to be solved in a practical running time. We demonstrate the success of our heuristics by solving for three different instances of the problem found in Babbitt's music, including one previously solved with constraint programming and one Babbitt himself was unable to solve. Use of the new heuristics allows each instance of the problem to be solved more quickly than was possible with previous approaches."

To bridge this research gap, this study investigates users' eye movement patterns and measures with two music retrieval tasks and two interface presentation modes. A user experiment was conducted with 16 participants whose eye movement and mouse click behaviors were recorded through professional eye trackers. Through analyzing visual patterns of eye gazes and movements as well as various metrics in prominent Areas of Interest (AOI), it is found that users' eye movement behaviors were related to task type. Besides, the results also disclosed that some eye movement metrics were related to both user effective-ness and user perception, and influenced by user characteristics. It is also found that some eye movement and user effectiveness metrics can be used to predict user perception. This study allows researchers to gain a deeper insight into user interactions with MIR systems from the perspective of eye movement measure."

The distance is usually summarized as a single value for song retrieval. This obscures observing the details of similarity patterns within the two songs. In this paper, we propose a cross-scape plot representation to visualize multi-scaled melody similarity between two symbolic music. The cross-scape plot is computed by stacking up a minimum local distance between two segments from each of the two songs. As the layer goes up, the segment size increases and it computes incrementally more long-term distances. This hierarchical representation allows for capturing the location and length of similar segments between two songs in a visually intuitive manner. We show the effectiveness of the cross-scape plot by evaluating it on examples from folk music collections with similarity-based categories and plagiarism cases."

In this paper we present JosquIntab, a dataset of automatically created enriched diplomatic transcriptions in MIDI and MEI format of 64 sixteenth-century lute intabulations, instrumental arrangements of vocal compositions. Such a dataset enables large-scale content-based computational analysis of music in lute tablature hitherto impossible.

We focus on the symbolic domain and target short polyphonic musical units consisting of 40 note sequences. The goal is to project these units into a continuous low dimensional space that has semantic relevance.

Our model has two components: an LSTM-based music language model (MLM) which can be trained on any MIDI data, not just that aligned with audio; and a blending model used to combine the probabilities of the MLM with those of the input probabilistic piano roll given by an acoustic multi-pitch detection model, which must be trained on (a comparably small amount of) aligned data. We use scheduled sampling to make the MLM robust to noisy sequences during testing. We analyze the performance of our model on the MAPS dataset using two different timesteps (40ms and 16th-note), comparing it against a strong baseline hidden Markov model with a training method not used before for the task to our knowledge. We report a statistically significant improvement over HMM decoding in terms of notewise F-measure with both timesteps, with 16th note timesteps improving further compared to 40ms timesteps."

Recent approaches to melodic elaboration have converged to a representation based on intervals, which allows the elaboration of pairs of notes. However, two problems remain: First, an interval-first representation obscures one-sided operations like neighbor notes. Second, while models of Western melody styles largely agree on step-wise operations such as neighbors and passing notes, larger intervals are either attributed to latent harmonic properties or left unexplained. This paper presents a grammar for melodies in North Indian raga music, showing not only that recursively applied neighbor and passing note operations underlie this style as well, but that larger intervals are generated as generalized neighbors, based on the tonal hierarchy of the underlying scale structure. The notion of a generalized neighbor is not restricted to ragas but can be transferred to other musical styles, opening new perspectives on latent structure behind melodies and music in general. The presented grammar is based on a graph representation that allows one to express elaborations on both notes and intervals, unifying and generalizing previous graph- and tree-based approaches."

First, the similarity scores are not necessarily metrics and are not directly comparable. Second, the algorithms are mostly first-order and of quadratic time-complexity, and finally, the features and weights need to be defined precisely. We propose an alternative approach which employs deep neural networks for end-to-end similarity metric learning. We contrast and compare different recurrent neural architectures (LSTM and GRU) for representing symbolic melodies as continuous vectors, and demonstrate how duplet and triplet loss functions can be employed to learn compact distributional representations of symbolic music in an induced melody space. This approach is contrasted with an alignment-based approach. We present results for the Meertens Tune Collections, which consists of a large number of vocal and instrumental monophonic pieces from Dutch musical sources, spanning five centuries, and demonstrate the robustness of the learned similarity metrics."

The multi-task learning is achieved by globally aggregating the skip connections of a beat tracking system built around temporal convolutional networks, and feeding them into a tempo classification layer.

We therefore developed the AIST Dance DB as the first large-scale shared database focusing on street dances to facilitate research on a variety of tasks related to dancing to music. It consists of 13,939 dance videos covering 10 major dance genres as well as 60 pieces of dance music composed for those genres. The videos were recorded by having 40 professional dancers (25 male and 15 female) dance to those pieces. We carefully designed this database so that it can cover both solo dancing and group dancing as well as both basic choreography moves and advanced moves originally choreographed by each dancer. Moreover, we used multiple cameras surrounding a dancer to simultaneously shoot from various directions. The AIST Dance DB will foster new MIR tasks such as dance-motion genre classification, dancer identification, and dance-technique estimation. We propose a dance-motion genre-classification task and developed four baseline methods of identifying dance genres of videos in this database. We evaluated these methods by extracting dancer body motions and training their classifiers on the basis of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network models and support-vector machine (SVM) models."

Using a corpus of 27 traditional fiddle tunes from the Shetland Isles, we examine inter-beat timing deviations, as well as inter-onset timing deviations of eighth note sequences.  Results show a number of distinct inter-beat and inter-onset rhythmic patterns that may characterize lilt, as well as idiosyncratic patterns for each performer.

Through max pooling across pitch, the CNN becomes invariant with regards to the key class (i.e., key disregarding mode) of the music. A multilayer perceptron combines the modality activation output with spectral features for the final prediction.

In this study, we focus on symbolic music with the goal of altering the 'style' of a piece while keeping its original 'content'. As opposed to the current methods, which are inherently restricted to be unsupervised due to the lack of 'aligned' data (i.e. the same musical piece played in multiple styles), we develop the first fully supervised algorithm for this task. At the core of our approach lies a synthetic data generation scheme which allows us to produce virtually unlimited amounts of aligned data, and hence avoid the above issue. In view of this data generation scheme, we propose an encoder-decoder model for translating symbolic music accompaniments between a number of different styles. Our experiments show that our models, although trained entirely on synthetic data, are capable of producing musically meaningful accompaniments even for real (non-synthetic) MIDI recordings."

In general, an analogy is made by partially transferring the music abstractions, i.e., high-level representations and their relationships, from one piece to another; however, this procedure requires disentangling music representations, which usually takes little effort for musicians but is non-trivial for computers. Three sub-problems arise: extracting latent representations from the observation, disentangling the representations so that each part has a unique semantic interpretation, and mapping the latent representations back to actual music. In this paper, we contribute an explicitly-constrained variational autoencoder (EC^2-VAE) as a unified solution to all three sub-problems. We focus on disentangling the pitch and rhythm representations of 8-beat music clips conditioned on chords. In producing music analogies, this model helps us to realize the imaginary situation of ""what if"" a piece is composed using a different pitch contour, rhythm pattern, or chord progression by borrowing the representations from other pieces.

Quantitative evaluations show high accuracy of audio/video emotion tagging when evaluated on each branch independently and high performance for cross-modal music retrieval. We also present cross-modal music retrieval experiments on Spotify music using user-generated videos from Instagram and Youtube as queries, and subjective evaluations show that the proposed model can retrieve relevant music. We present the music retrieval results at: http://www.ece.rochester.edu/~bli23/projects/query.html."

Often, these ensembles consist of instruments from one or two of the families woodwinds, brass, piano, vocals, and strings. In this paper, we consider the task of automatically recognizing instrument families from music recordings. As one main contribution, we investigate the influence of data normalization, pre-processing, and augmentation techniques on the generalization capability of the models. We report on experiments using three datasets of monotimbral recordings covering different levels of timbral complexity: isolated notes, isolated melodies, and polyphonic pieces. While data augmentation and the normalization of spectral patches turned out to be beneficial, pre-processing strategies such as logarithmic compression and channel-energy normalization did not lead to substantial improvements. Furthermore, our cross-dataset experiments indicate the necessity of further optimization routines such as domain adaptation."

While various machine learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been employed for the task, most of them have limitations in capturing long-term dependency or require training of an additional model.  In this work, we utilize a self-attention mechanism for chord recognition to focus on certain regions of chords. Training of the proposed bi-directional Transformer for chord recognition (BTC) consists of a single phase while showing competitive performance. Through an attention map analysis, we have visualized how attention was performed. It turns out that the model was able to divide segments of chords by utilizing adaptive receptive field of the attention mechanism. Furthermore, it was observed that the model was able to effectively capture long-term dependencies, making use of essential information regardless of distance."

We use a similar idea here to represent the harmonic series of tempo candidates. We propose the Harmonic-Constant-Q-Modulation which represents, using a 4D-tensors, the harmonic series of  modulation frequencies (considered as tempo frequencies) in several acoustic frequency bands over time.

This problem hinders the practical usages of audio recognition systems. The difficulty mainly lies in the intrinsic long-tail distribution of chord qualities, and most chord qualities have too few samples for model training.  In this paper, we propose a new model for audio chord recognition under a huge chord vocabulary. The core concept is to decompose any chord label into a set of musically meaningful components (e.g., triad, bass, seventh), each with a much smaller vocabulary compared to the size of the overall chord vocabulary. A multitask classifier is then trained to recognize all the components given the audio feature, and then labels of individual components are reassembled to form the final chord label. Experiments show that the proposed system not only achieves state-of-the-art results on traditional evaluation metrics but also performs well on a large vocabulary."

In the composition stage, a short clip of randomly-generated music was used as a seed for the RNN to start music score prediction. To form structured music, segments of generated music from different seeds were concatenated together. To improve the quality and structure of the generated music, we integrated music theory knowledge into the model, such as controlling the spacing of gaps in the vocal melody, normalizing the timing of chord changes, and requiring notes to be related to the song's key (C major, for example). This integration improved the quality of the generated music as verified by a professional composer. We also conducted a subjective listening test that showed our generated music was close to original music by the Beatles in terms of style similarity, professional quality, and interestingness."

We conducted an online survey asking about people's past experiences on giving and receiving music recommendations. We found that in addition to the aesthetic qualities of music and the respondent's taste, expectations regarding the delivery (e.g., timing, persistence) of the recommendations, familiarity, trust in the recommender's abilities, and the rationale for suggestions were important factors. We discuss the implications for the design of music recommenders based on the findings, including better rationale for and accessibility of recommended music, improved saving options, and more targeted delivery at specific times. The data also suggests disparities in how people wish to receive music recommendations and what will influence them to listen to recommendations, versus how they would like to offer recommendations to others. In addition, the findings highlight the importance of music recommendations in people's existing social relationships and their role in building/improving new relationships."

These approaches commonly employ supervised learning models that predict various time-frequency representations, by minimizing element-wise losses such as the cross entropy function. However, applying the loss in this manner assumes conditional independence of each label given the input, and thus cannot accurately express inter-label dependencies. To address this issue, we introduce an adversarial training scheme that operates directly on the time-frequency representations and makes the output distribution closer to the ground-truth. Through adversarial learning, we achieve a consistent improvement in both frame-level and note-level metrics over Onsets and Frames, a state-of-the-art music transcription model. Our results show that adversarial learning can significantly reduce the error rate while increasing the confidence of the model estimations. Our approach is generic and applicable to any transcription model based on multi-label predictions, which are very common in music signal analysis."

In this paper, we propose and carry out a user study on evaluating the usefulness of automatic music transcription in the context of ethnomusicology. As part of the study, we recruited 16 participants who were asked to transcribe short musical excerpts either from scratch or using the output of an AMT system as a basis.

The results show no quantitative advantage of using AMT, but important indications regarding appropriate user groups and evaluation measures are provided."

Their success on piano score generation is partially explained by the large volumes of symbolic data readily available for that domain. We leverage the recently-introduced NES-MDB dataset of four-voice scores from an early video game sound synthesis chip (the NES), which we find to be well-suited to training with the Transformer architecture. To further improve the performance of our model, we propose a pre-training technique to leverage the information in a large collection of heterogeneous music. Despite differences between the two corpora, we find that this pre-training procedure improves both quantitative and qualitative performance for our primary task."

We propose an architecture called Complex Autoencoder (CAE) which learns features invariant to orthogonal transformations. Mapping signals onto complex basis functions learned by the CAE results in a transformation-invariant ""magnitude space"" and a transformation-variant ""phase space"". The phase space is useful to infer transformations between data pairs.

In this paper, we present humdrumR (""hum-drummer""), a software package designed to afford computational musicology research for both advanced and novice computer coders. Humdrum is a powerful and influential existing computational musicology framework, including the humdrum syntax—a flexible text data format with tens of thousands of extant scores available (Kern Scores)—and the Bash-based humdrum toolkit. HumdrumR is a modern replacement for the humdrum toolkit, based in the data-analysis/statistical programming language R. By combining the flexibility and transparency of the humdrum syntax with the powerful data analysis tools and concise syntax of R, humdrumR offers an appealing new approach to would-be computational musicologists.

Unlike these methods, our approach generates music notation directly from the input audio in a single stage. For this, we use a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function which does not require annotated alignments of audio frames with the score rhythmic information. We trained our model using as input Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven string quartets and Bach chorales synthesized with different tempos and expressive performances.

Bosch+Spotify>USA>company|Unknown>Unknown>Unknown,"Single-f0 estimation methods, including pitch trackers and melody estimators, have historically been evaluated using a set of common metrics which score estimates frame-wise in terms of pitch and voicing accuracy. ""Voicing"" refers to whether or not a pitch is active, and has historically been regarded as a binary value. However, this has limitations because it is often ambiguous whether a pitch is present or absent, making a binary choice difficult for humans and algorithms alike. For example, when a source fades out or reverberates, the exact point where the pitch is no longer present is unclear. Many single-f0 estimation algorithms select a threshold for when a pitch is active or not, and different choices of threshold drastically affect the results of standard metrics. In this paper, we present a refinement on the existing single-f0 metrics, by allowing the estimated voicing to be represented as a continuous likelihood, and introducing a weighting on frame level pitch accuracy, which considers the energy of the source producing the f0 relative to the energy of the rest of the signal. We compare these metrics experimentally with the previous metrics using a number of algorithms and datasets and discuss the fundamental differences. We show that, compared to the previous metrics, our proposed metrics allow threshold-independent algorithm comparisons."

For reconstruction, latent variables of timbre and pitch are sampled from corresponding mixture components, and are concatenated as the input to a decoder. We show the model's efficacy using latent space visualization, and a quantitative analysis indicates the discriminability of these spaces, even with a limited number of instrument labels for training. The model allows for controllable synthesis of selected instrument sounds by sampling from the latent spaces. To evaluate this, we trained instrument and pitch classifiers using original labeled data. These classifiers achieve high F-scores when tested on our synthesized sounds, which verifies the model's performance of controllable realistic timbre/pitch synthesis. Our model also enables timbre transfer between multiple instruments, with a single encoder-decoder architecture, which is evaluated by measuring the shift in the posterior of instrument classification.

This is commonly addressed by defining some heuristic notion of pattern significance, and returning only the most significant patterns. This paper develops a method of pattern discovery that models human judgement of what constitutes a significant pattern by incorporating annotations of repeated patterns, avoiding the need to design heuristics.  We take pattern discovery as a clustering task, where the input is a set of passages of monophonic music, represented as vectors of extracted features, and the output clusters correspond to discovered patterns. The human annotations are used to train a neural network to learn a low-dimensional embedding of the feature space that maps passages of music close together when they are occurrences of the same ground-truth pattern. The results of this approach match up with the annotations significantly better than the results of an approach using clustering without subspace learning. We provide examples of the types of patterns that this method tends to discover and discuss its feasibility and practicality as a tool for extracting useful information about repetitive structure in music."

This can be done by manually annotating one reference performance, and then automatically synchronizing other performances, using audio-to-audio alignment algorithms. In this paper we address several questions related to those tasks. First, we analyze different annotations of the same musical piece, quantifying timing deviations between the respective human annotators. A statistical evaluation of the marker time stamps will provide (a) an estimate of the expected timing precision of human annotations and (b) a ground truth for subsequent automatic alignment experiments. We then carry out a systematic evaluation of different audio features for audio-to-audio alignment, quantifying the degree of alignment accuracy that can be achieved, and relate this to the results from the annotation study."

Second, the capability and flexibility of the rule-based pitch control in modeling various singing styles are insufficient, causing the converted singing voices to lack variety. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an improved system that uses 1) a statistical voice conversion approach to convert spectrograms extracted from EL speeches into those of natural speeches and 2) a deep generative model-based approach called VAE-SPACE for pitch modification, which generates pitch patterns in a data-driven manner instead of following manually designed rules. The experimental results revealed that 1) the conversion of spectrograms was effective in improving the naturalness of singing voices, and 2) the statistical pitch control approach was able to achieve comparable results with the rule-based approach, which was very carefully designed to be specialized in singing."

For users to input melodies, we designed a simplified sheet-music based interface.  To support an interactive experience at scale, we re-implemented Coconet in TensorFlow.js (Smilkov et al., 2019) to run in the browser and reduced its runtime from 40s to 2s by adopting dilated depth-wise separable convolutions and fusing operations.  We also reduced the model download size to approximately 400KB through post-training weight quantization.  We calibrated a speed test based on partial model evaluation time to determine if the harmonization request should be performed locally or sent to remote TPU servers.  In three days, people spent 350 years worth of time playing with the Bach Doodle, and Coconet received more than 55 million queries.  Users could choose to rate their compositions and contribute them to a public dataset, which we are releasing with this paper.  We hope that the community finds this dataset useful for applications ranging from ethnomusicological studies, to music education, to improving machine learning models."

A common feature of these techniques is the periodic modulation in the time--frequency domain. We propose a representation based on time--frequency scattering to model the inter-class variability for fine discrimination of these periodic modulations. Time--frequency scattering is an instance of the scattering transform, an approach for building invariant, stable, and informative signal representations. The proposed representation is calculated around the wavelet subband of maximal acoustic energy, rather than over all the wavelet bands. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we build a system that computes the representation as input to a machine learning classifier. Whereas previously published datasets for playing technique analysis focus primarily on techniques recorded in isolation, for ecological validity, we create a new dataset to evaluate the system. The dataset, named CBF-periDB, contains full-length expert performances on the Chinese bamboo flute that have been thoroughly annotated by the players themselves. We report F-measures of 99% for flutter-tongue, 82% for trill, 69% for vibrato, and 51% for tremolo detection, and provide explanatory visualisations of scattering coefficients for each of these techniques."

However, they are learned from only the succession of notes itself without explicitly employing domain knowledge of musical concepts such as rhythm, contour, and fragmentation &amp; consolidation. We approximate such musical domain knowledge as a function, and feed it into our model. Then, two decoupled spaces are learned: the extraction space that captures the target concept, and the residual space that captures the remainder. For monophonic symbolic music, our model exhibits high decoupling/modeling performance.  Controllability in generation is improved: (i) our interpolation enables concept-aware flexible control over blending two musical fragments, and (ii) our variation generation enables users to make concept-aware adjustable variations."

We present Unmixer, a web service that will analyze and extract loops from any audio uploaded by a user. The loops are presented in an interface that allows users to immediately remix the loops; if users upload multiple tracks, they can easily create mash-ups with the loops, which are automatically matched in tempo. To analyze the audio, we use a recently-proposed method of source separation based on the nonnegative Tucker decomposition of the spectrum. To reduce interference among the extracted loops, we propose an extra factorization step with a sparseness constraint and demonstrate that it improves the source separation result. We also propose a method for selecting the best instances of the extracted loops and demonstrate its effectiveness in an evaluation. Both of these improvements are incorporated into the backend of the interface. Finally, we discuss the feedback collected in a set of user evaluations."

We contribute to this body of work by examining how disruption happens in a corpus about music influence from the All Music Guide. A disruptive artist is one that creates a new stream of influences; this artist builds on prior efforts, but influences subsequent artists that do not build on the same prior efforts. We leverage methods devised to study disruption in Science and Technology, and apply them to the context of music creation. Our results point that such methods identify innovative artists, and that disruption is often uncorrelated with network centrality."

Yet, the propose solutions often rely on simplifications and fail to address the diversity and subjectivity of music genres. Accounting for these has, though, many benefits for aligning knowledge sources, integrating data and enriching musical items with tags. Here, we choose a new angle for the genre study by seeking to predict what would be the genres of musical items in a target tag system, knowing the genres assigned to them within source tag systems. We call this a translation task and identify three cases: 1) no common annotated corpus between source and target tag systems exists, 2) such a large corpus exists, 3) only few common annotations exist. We propose the related solutions: a knowledge-based translation modeled as taxonomy mapping, a statistical translation modeled with maximum likelihood logistic regression; a hybrid translation modeled with maximum a posteriori logistic regression with priors given by the knowledge-based translation. During evaluation, the solutions fit well the identified cases and the hybrid translation is systematically the most effective w.r.t. multilabel  classification metrics. This is a first attempt to unify genre tag systems by leveraging both representation and interpretation diversity."

We present an interactive workflow to address these problems, and test it on Bach chorales. First, a rule-based model was used to generate preliminary, consistent chord labels in order to pre-train three machine learning models. These four models were grouped into an ensemble that generated chord labels by voting, achieving 91.4% accuracy on a reserved test set. A domain expert then corrected only those chords that the ensemble did not agree on unanimously (20.9% of the generated labels). Finally, we used these corrected annotations to re-train the machine learning models, and the resulting ensemble attained an accuracy of 93.5% on the reserved test set, a 24.4% reduction in the number of errors. This versatile interactive workflow can either work in a fully automatic way, or can capitalize on relatively minimal human involvement to generate higher-quality chord labels. It combines the consistency of rule-based models with the nuance of manual analysis to generate relatively inexpensive high-quality ground truth for training effective machine learning models."

Although human similarity judgments are the gold standard, computational analysis is often preferable, since results are often easier to reproduce, and computational methods are much more scalable. Moreover, computation based approaches can be calculated quickly and on demand, which is a prerequisite for use with an online system. We propose StyleRank, a method to measure the similarity between a MIDI file and an arbitrary musical style delineated by a collection of MIDI files. MIDI files are encoded using a novel set of features and an embedding is learned using Random Forests. Experimental evidence demonstrates that StyleRank is highly correlated with human perception of stylistic similarity, and that it is precise enough to rank generated samples based on their similarity to the style of a corpus. In addition, similarity can be measured with respect to a single feature, allowing specific discrepancies between generated samples and a particular musical style to be identified."

Improvements in deep learning lead to a big progress in music source separation performance. However, most of the previous studies are restricted to separating a few limited number of sources, such as vocals, drums, bass, and other. In this study, we propose a network for audio query-based music source separation that can explicitly encode the source information from a query signal regardless of the number and/or kind of target signals. The proposed method consists of a Query-net and a Separator: given a query and a mixture, the Query-net encodes the query into the latent space, and the Separator estimates masks conditioned by the latent vector, which is then applied to the mixture for separation. The Separator can also generate masks using the latent vector from the training samples, allowing separation in the absence of a query. We evaluate our method on the MUSDB18 dataset, and experimental results show that the proposed method can separate multiple sources with a single network. In addition, through further investigation of the latent space we demonstrate that our method can generate continuous outputs via latent vector interpolation."

To this end, we first collect a set of multimedia clips that include both music and corresponding dance motion. We then extract the joint coordinates of the dancer from video and the mel-spectrogram of music from audio and train our network using music-choreography pairs as input. Finally, a novel dance motion is generated at the inference time when only music is given as an input. We performed a user study for a qualitative evaluation of the proposed method, and the results show that the proposed model is able to generate musically meaningful and natural dance movements given an unheard song."

In this work, we investigate how to utilize local data representation with pattern recognition for onset and offset detection of singing voice. We consider onset and offset detection as a hierarchical classification problem, where every local data representation as input is classified into one of all the possible event states in monophonic singing, namely the silence, activation, and transition states, and the transition state is further classified into the onset and offset states. An objective function based on this hierarchical taxonomy nicely guides the model to capture the complicated temporal dynamics of note sequences. Multi-channel data representations containing spectral differences and pitch saliency are employed to reflect the patterns of note transition in singing voice signals. The proposed method implemented with residual networks provides improved performance over prior art in onset and offset detection. Moreover, by integrating with a pitch detection framework, the proposed method also outperforms previous singing voice transcription methods. This result emphasizes the importance of note segmentation in singing voice transcription."

While audio-sheet music retrieval has been explored by a number of works, this scenario is novel in that the query is a cell phone picture rather than a digital scan.  To solve this problem, we introduce a mid-level feature representation called a bootleg score which explicitly encodes the rules of Western musical notation.  We convert both the MIDI and the sheet music into bootleg scores using deterministic rules of music and classical computer vision techniques for detecting simple geometric shapes.  Once the MIDI and cell phone image have been converted into bootleg scores, we estimate the alignment using dynamic programming.  The most notable characteristic of our system is that it does test-time adaptation and has no trainable weights at all--only a set of about 30 hyperparameters.  On a dataset containing 1000 cell phone pictures taken of 100 scores of classical piano music, our system achieves an F measure score of .869 and outperforms baseline systems based on commercial optical music recognition software."

Human listeners can readily distinguish melodies from accompaniment; however, making this distinction given only the written score – i.e. without listening to the music performed – can be a difficult task. Solving this task is of great importance for both Music Information Retrieval and musicological applications.  In this paper, we propose an automated approach to identifying the most salient melody line in a symbolic score. The backbone of the method consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) estimating the probability that each note in the score (more precisely: each pixel in a piano roll encoding of the score) belongs to the melody line. We train and evaluate the method on various datasets, using manual annotations where available and solo instrument parts where not. We also propose a method to inspect the CNN and to analyze the influence exerted by notes on the prediction of other notes; this method can be applied whenever the output of a neural network has the same size as the input."
