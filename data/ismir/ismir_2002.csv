The eXtensible PlayList (XPL) representation allows users to express playlists with varying degrees of specificity. XPL handles references to exact files or URLs as well as rules for selecting content based on metadata constraints. XPL also allows the transitions between tracks in a playlist to be specified. This paper describes the features of XPL, a system for rendering XPL specifications and use of an advanced XPL renderer in an existing application."

We introduce a timbral similarity measures for comparing music titles. This measure is based on a Gaussian model of cepstrum coefficients. We describe the timbre extractor and the corresponding timbral similarity relation. We describe experiments in assessing the quality of the similarity relation, and show that the measure is able to yield interesting similarity relations, in particular when used in conjunction with other similarity relations. We illustrate the use of the descriptor in several EMD applications developed in the context of the Cuidado European project."

McPherson+University of Waikato>NZL>education;Sally Jo Cunningham+University of Waikato>NZL>education,"The use of audio queries for searching multimedia content has increased rapidly with the rise of music information retrieval; there are now many Internet-accessible systems that take audio queries as input. However, testing the robustness of such a system can be problematic, as there is currently no standard test-bed of queries and music files available. A corpus of audio queries would aid researchers in the development of both audio signal processing techniques and audio query systems. Such a corpus would also be essential for making empirical comparisons between different systems and methods. We propose a pilot study that will field test a procedure for collecting audio queries. The lessons learned in the pilot study will guide us in refining the collection methodology, and we will make a final set of queries freely available to MIR researchers. The participants for this pilot study will be attendees of the ISMIR 2002 Conference."

By using natural language as input for human-oriented queries to large-scale music collections we were able to address the needs of non-musicians. The entire system is applicable for future semantic web services, existing music websites and mobile devices. Beside the framework we present a novel idea to incorporate the processing of lyrics based on standard information retrieval methods, i.e the vector space model."""

We have evaluated four web-accessible music libraries, focusing particularly on features that are particular to music libraries, such as music retrieval mechanisms. Although the original focus of the work was on how modalities are combined within the interactions with such libraries, that was not where the main difficulties were found. Libraries were generally well designed for use of different modalities. The main challenges identified relate to the details of melody matching and to simplifying the choices of file format. These issues are discussed in detail."

Although such a system may have a wider range of applications, it was mainly developed to become the acoustic module of a query-by-humming (QBH) system for retrieving pieces of music from a digitized musical library. The first part of the paper is devoted to the systematic evaluation of a variety of state-of-the art transcription systems. The main result of this evaluation is that there is clearly a need for more accurate systems. Especially the segmentation was experienced as being too error prone (20% segmentation errors). In the second part of the paper, a new auditory model based transcription system is proposed and evaluated. The results of that evaluation are very promising. Segmentation errors vary between 0 and 7%, dependent on the amount of lyrics that is used by the singer. The paper ends with the description of an experimental study that was issued to demonstrate that the accuracy of the newly proposed transcription system is not very sensitive to the choice of the free parameters, at least as long as they remain in the vicinity of the values one could forecast on the basis of their meaning."""

To find the most representative excerpt, we maximize the average segment similarity to the entire work. After window-based audio parameterization, a quantitative similarity measure is calculated between every pair of windows, and the results are embedded in a 2-D similarity matrix. Summing the similarity matrix over the support of a segment results in a measure of how similar that segment is to the whole. This measure is maximized to find the segment that best represents the entire work. We discuss variations on the method, and present experimental results for orchestral music, popular songs, and jazz. These results demonstrate that the method finds significantly representative excerpts, using very few assumptions about the source audio."

Dannenberg+Carnegie Mellon University>USA>education;Ning Hu+Carnegie Mellon University>USA>education,"Human listeners are able to recognize structure in music through the perception of repetition and other relationships within a piece of music. This work aims to automate the task of music analysis. Music is “explained” in terms of embedded relationships, especially repetition of segments or phrases. The steps in this process are the transcription of audio into a representation with a similarity or distance metric, the search for similar segments, forming clusters of similar segments, and explaining music in terms of these clusters. Several transcription methods are considered: monophonic pitch estimation, chroma (spectral) representation, and polyphonic transcription followed by harmonic analysis. Also, several algorithms that search for similar segments are described. These techniques can be used to perform an analysis of musical structure, as illustrated by examples."

The pitch and rhythm dimensions of music are used, and the musical words (a term coined by Downie [2]) generated enable text retrieval methods to be used with music retrieval. We outline an experimental framework for a comparative and fault-tolerance study of various n-gramming strategies and encoding precision using six experimental databases. For monophonic queries we focus in particular on query-by-humming (QBH) systems. Error models addressed in several QBH studies are surveyed for the fault-tolerance study. Our experiments show that different n-gramming strategies and encoding precision differ widely in their effectiveness. We present the results of our comparative and fault-tolerance study on a collection of 5380 polyphonic music pieces encoded in the MIDI format."

To develop such a measure, however, presupposes some ‘ground truth’ training data describing the actual similarity between certain pairs of artists that constitute the desired output of the measure. Since artist similarity is wholly subjective, such data is not easily obtained. In this paper, we describe several attempts to construct a full matrix of similarity measures between a set of some 400 popular artists by regularizing limited subjective judgment data. We also detail our attempts to evaluate these measures by comparison with direct subjective similarity judgments collected via a web-based survey in April 2002. Overall, we find that subjective artist similarities are quite variable between users—casting doubt on the concept of a single ‘ground truth’. Our best measure, however, gives reasonable agreement with the subjective data, and forms a usable stand-in. In addition, our evaluation methodology may be useful for comparing other measures of artist similarity."

Out of these efforts, a common MIR practice can emerge."
18,Gordon Geekie,Carnatic Ragas as Music Information Retrieval Entities.,2002,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415994,Gordon Geekie+Manchester Metropolitan University>GBR>education,"Carnatic music is the ‘art’ music of the four southern States of India (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamilnadu). One difference between Carnatic music and the better-known Hindusthani music of North India is its embeddedness in a religious-philosophical context. This context crucially determines the objects of knowledge organization and the indigenous theory of musical affect. The author presents the view that a digital library of Carnatic music should contain the objects of knowledge organization and their interrelationships as conceived by indigenous practitioners and audiences, rather than by Western specialists or North Indian practitioners. The author demonstrates how three features of Carnatic music (viz. aural transmission, improvisation and cultural context) have particular implications for the development of a digital library. Aural transmission results in musical documents being less important sources of information than recordings. Improvisation results in a highly transformational and often ambiguous relationship between (intra)musical signifiers and signified, causing problems of classification and machine recognition. The cultural context favours the prioritisation of emotional affect over introductory ease of listening and even technical recording quality in the selection of the recordings to be included in a digital library of Carnatic music."

Various commonly available DBs have been built in other research fields and have made a significant contribution to the research in those fields. The field of musical information processing, however, has lacked a commonly available music DB. We therefore built the RWC Music Database which contains four original DBs: the Popular Music Database (100 pieces), Royalty-Free Music Database (15 pieces), Classical Music Database (50 pieces), and Jazz Music Database (50 pieces). Each consists of originally-recorded music compact discs, standard MIDI files, and text files of lyrics. These DBs are now available in Japan at a cost equal to only duplication, shipping, and handling charges (virtually for free), and we plan to make them available outside Japan. We hope that our DB will encourage further advances in musical information processing research."

You’re in your car, listening to the radio and suddenly you hear a song that catches your attention. It’s the best new song you have heard for a long time, but you missed the announcement and don’t recognize the artist. Still, you would like to know more about this music. What should you do? You could call the radio station, but that’s too cumbersome. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could push a few buttons on your mobile phone and a few seconds later the phone would respond with the name of the artist and the title of the music you’re listening to? Perhaps even sending an email to your default email address with some supplemental information. In this paper we present an audio fingerprinting system, which makes the above scenario possible. By using the fingerprint of an unknown audio clip as a query on a fingerprint database, which contains the fingerprints of a large library of songs, the audio clip can be identified. At the core of the presented system are a highly robust fingerprint extraction method and a very efficient fingerprint search strategy, which enables searching a large fingerprint database with only limited computing resources."

Two different yet approximately equally accurate approaches were taken to solve the problem. The first is based on periodicity detection in the amplitude envelopes of the signal at subbands. The band-wise periodicity estimates are aggregated into a summary autocorrelation function, the characteristics of which reveal the drums. The other mechanism applies straightforward acoustic pattern recognition with mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients as features and a Gaussian mixture model classifier. The integrated system achieves 88 % correct segmentation over a database of 28 hours of music from different musical genres. For the both methods, errors occur for borderline cases with soft percussive-like drum accompaniment, or transient-like instrumentation without drums."

While music metadata in the library catalog records offer less than a perfect solution, they can and should have an important role in the total solution.

Papipuun performs quick listening in a manner similar to a stylus skipping on a scratched record, but the skipping occurs correctly at punctuations of musical phrases, not arbitrarily. First, we developed a method for representing polyphony based on time-span reduction in the generative theory of tonal music (GTTM) and the deductive object-oriented database (DOOD). The operation, least upper bound, plays an important role in similarity checking of polyphonies represented in our method. Next, in a preprocessing phase, a user analyzes a set piece by the time-span reduction, using a dedicated tool called TS-Editor. For the real-time phase, the user interacts with the main system, Summarizer, to perform music summarization. Summarizer discovers a piece structure by means of similarity checking. When the user identifies the fragments to be skipped, Summarizer deletes them and concatenates the rest. Papipuun can produce a music summarization of good quality, reflecting the atmosphere of an entire piece through interaction with the user."

Hoos+Darmstadt University of Technology>DEU>education|University of British Columbia>CAN>education,"Voice separation, along with tempo detection and quantisation, is one of the basic problems of computer-based transcription of music. An adequate separation of notes into different voices is crucial for obtaining readable and usable scores from performances of polyphonic music recorded on keyboard (or other polyphonic) instruments; for improving quantisation results within a transcription system; and in the context of music retrieval systems that primarily support monophonic queries. In this paper we propose a new voice separation algorithm based on a stochastic local search method. Different from many previous approaches, our algorithm allows chords in the individual voices; its behaviour is controlled by a small number of intuitive and musically motivated parameters; and it is fast enough to allow interactive optimisation of the result by adjusting the parameters in real-time. We demonstrate that compared to existing approaches, our new algorithm generates better solutions for a number of typical voice separation problems. We also show how by changing its parameters it is possible to create score output suitable for different needs, piano-style orchestral scores."

These ideas were examined by presenting 22 participants with 7 classical musical pieces, asking one-half of them to write words descriptive of each piece, and the other half words they would use if searching for each piece. All the words used by all subjects in both tasks were classified into 7 categories. The two most frequently appearing categories were emotions and occasions or filmed events regardless of the task type. These subjects, none of whom had formal training in music, almost never used words related to formal features of music, rather using words indicating other features, most of which have not been considered in existing or proposed music IR systems. These results suggest that music IR research should be extended to consider needs other than finding known items, or items identified by formal characteristics, and that understanding music information needs of users should be prioritized to design more sophisticated music IR systems."

The research presented in this paper attempts to automatically establish the identity of a singer using acoustic features extracted from songs in a database of popular music. As a first step, an untrained algorithm for automatically extracting vocal segments from within songs is presented. Once these vocal segments are identified, they are presented to a singer identification system that has been trained on data taken from other songs by the same artists in the database."

We suggest a new vision of automated pattern analysis that generalizes the multiple viewpoint approach by adding a new paradigm based on analogy and temporal approach of musical scores. Through a chronological scanning of the score, analogies are inferred between local relationships — namely, notes and intervals — and global structures — namely, patterns — whose paradigms are stored inside an abstract pattern trie (APT). Basic mechanisms for inference of new patterns are described. The same pattern-matching algorithm used for pattern discovery during pre-analysis of musical works is reused during MIR applications. Such an elastic vision of music enables a generalized understanding of its plastic expression. This project, in an early stage, introduces a broader paradigm of automated music analysis."

Music notation is rich in structural information, and the relative positions of objects can often help to identify them. When objects are unidentified or mis-identified, many current systems “coerce” the set of objects into some semantic representation, for example by modifying the detected durations. This could cause correctly identified symbols to be modified. The knowledge that the current set of identified symbols cannot be semantically parsed could instead be used to re-examine some of the symbols before deciding whether or not the classification is correct. This paper describes work in progress involving the use of feedback between the various phases of the optical music recognition process to automatically correct mistakes, such as symbolic classification errors or mis-detected staff systems."

A variety of log2 and linear quantizations of IOI and IOI ratios are considered for each representation. The utility of encoding with a particular quantization is measured by the ability of a simple string-matcher to differentiate between themes in a melodic corpus. Results indicate that time is best represented by IOI ratios quantized to a logarithmic scale.

The patterns are represented as acoustic signals, and are not assumed to have been performed with similar sound sets. Two novel methods are presented that constitute the algorithmic core of the system. First, a probabilistic musical meter estimation process is described, which segments a continuous musical signal into patterns. As a side-product, the method outputs tatum, tactus (beat), and measure lengths. A subsequent process performs the actual similarity measurements. Acoustic features are extracted which model the fluctuation of loudness and brightness within the pattern, and dynamic time warping is then applied to align the patterns to be compared. In simulations, the system behaved consistently by assigning high similarity measures to similar musical rhythms, even when performed using different sound sets."

In short, it tries to detect the pitches in a sung melody and compares these pitches with symbolic representations of the known melodies. Melodies that are similar to the sung pitches are retrieved. Approximate pattern matching in the melody comparison process compensates for the errors in the sung melody by using classical dynamic programming. A filtering method is used to save computation in the dynamic programming framework. This paper presents the algorithms for pitch detection, note onset detection, quantization, melody encoding and approximate pattern matching as they have been implemented in the CubyHum software system. Since human reproduction of melodies is imperfect, findings from an experimental singing study were a crucial input to the development of the algorithms. Future research should pay special attention to the reliable detection of note onsets in any preferred singing style. In addition, research on index methods and fast bit-parallelism algorithms for approximate pattern matching need to be further pursued to decrease computational requirements when dealing with large melody databases."

PATS generates playlists that suit a particular context-of-use, that is, the real-world environment in which the music is heard. To create playlists, it uses a dynamic clustering method in which songs are grouped based on their attribute similarity. The similarity measure selectively weighs attribute-values, as not all attribute-values are equally important in a context-of-use. An inductive learning algorithm is used to reveal the most important attribute-values for a context-of-use from preference feedback of the user. In a controlled user experiment, the quality of PATS-compiled and randomly assembled playlists for jazz music was assessed in two contexts-of-use. The quality of the randomly assembled playlists was used as base-line. The two contexts-of-use were ‘listening to soft music’ and ‘listening to lively music’. Playlist quality was measured by precision (songs that suit the context-of-use), coverage (songs that suit the context-of-use but that were not already contained in previous playlists) and a rating score. Results showed that PATS playlists contained increasingly more preferred music (increasingly higher precision), covered more preferred music in the collection (higher coverage), and were rated higher than randomly assembled playlists."

The strategy employed here is to consider the audio signal as a succession of “states” (at various scales) corresponding to the structure (at various scales) of a piece of music. This is, of course, only applicable to certain kinds of musical genres based on some kind of repetition. From the audio signal, we first derive dynamic features representing the time evolution of the energy content in various frequency bands. These features constitute our observations from which we derive a representation of the music in terms of “states”. Since human segmentation and grouping performs better upon subsequent hearings, this “natural” approach is followed here. The first pass of the proposed algorithm uses segmentation in order to create “templates”. The second pass uses these templates in order to propose a structure of the music using unsupervised learning methods (K-means and hidden Markov model). The audio summary is finally constructed by choosing a representative example of each state. Further refinements of the summary audio signal construction, uses overlap-add, and a tempo detection/beat alignment in order to improve the audio quality of the created summary."

To our knowledge, we are the first to use polyphonic audio queries to retrieve from polyphonic symbolic collections. Furthermore, as our results will show, we will not only use an audio query to retrieve a known-item symbolic piece, but we will use it to retrieve an entire set of real-world composed variations on that piece, also in the symbolic format. The harmonic modeling approach which forms the basis of this work is a new and valuable technique which has both wide applicability and future potential."

The main drawback in most of the offline algorithms is the space the indexing structure requires. The amount of data stored into the structure can however be reduced by storing only the suitable index terms or phrases instead of the whole contents of the database. Repetition is agreed to be one of the most important factors of musical meaningfulness. Therefore repetitive musical phrases are suitable for indexing purposes. The extraction of such phrases can be done by applying an existing text mining method to musical data. Because of the differences between text and musical data the application requires some technical modification of the method. This paper introduces a text mining-based music database indexing method that extracts maximal frequent phrases from musical data and sorts them by their length, frequency and personality. The implementation of the method found three different types of phrases from the test corpus consisting of Irish folk music tunes. The suitable two types of phrases out of three are easily recognized and separated from the set of all phrases to form an index data for the database."

Yet, currently these organizations following musical styles have to be designed manually. In this paper we propose an approach to automatically create a hierarchical organization of music archives following their perceived sound similarity. More specifically, characteristics of frequency spectra are extracted and transformed according to psycho-acoustic models. Subsequently, the Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map, a popular unsupervised neural network, is used to create a hierarchical organization, offering both an interface for interactive exploration as well as retrieval of music according to perceived sound similarity."

Query-by-humming (QBH) is also an application that makes retrieval based on major characteristics of music, that is, ""melody"". There have been some researches on QBH system, most of which are to retrieve music from symbolic music data by humming query. However, when the usability of technology is taken into consideration, retrieval of music in the form of polyphonic raw audio would be more useful and needed in the applications such as internet music search or music juke box, where the music data is stored not in symbolic form but in raw digital audio signal because such music data is more natural format for consumption. Our focus is on the realization of query-by-humming technology for an easy-to-use application, which entails full automation of all the processes of the system, including melody information extraction from polyphonic raw audio. In our system, melody feature of music database and humming is not represented by distinct note information but by the probability of note occurrence. Similarity is then measured between the melody features of humming and music data using DP matching method. This paper presents developed algorithms and experimental results for key steps of QBH system including the melody feature extraction method from polyphonic audio and humming, their representation for matching, and matching method between represented melody information from polyphonic audio and humming."

In this paper, Pitch Histograms are defined and proposed as a way to represent the pitch content of music signals both in symbolic and audio form. This representation is evaluated in the context of automatic musical genre classification. A multiple-pitch detection algorithm for polyphonic signals is used to calculate Pitch Histograms for audio signals. In order to evaluate the extent and significance of errors resulting from the automatic multiple-pitch detection, automatic musical genre classification results from symbolic and audio data are compared. The comparison indicates that Pitch Histograms provide valuable information for musical genre classification. The results obtained for both symbolic and audio cases indicate that although pitch errors degrade classification performance for the audio case, Pitch Histograms can be effectively used for classification in both cases."
