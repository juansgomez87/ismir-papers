0,Go Shibata;Ryo Nishikimi;Kazuyoshi Yoshii,Music structure analysis based on an LSTM-HSMM hybrid model,2020,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245362,Go Shibata+Kyoto University>JPN>education|Unknown>Unknown>Unknown|Unknown>Unknown>Unknown;Ryo Nishikimi+Kyoto University>JPN>education|Unknown>Unknown>Unknown|Unknown>Unknown>Unknown;Kazuyoshi Yoshii+Kyoto University>JPN>education|Unknown>Unknown>Unknown|Unknown>Unknown>Unknown,"This paper describes a statistical music structure analysis method that splits an audio signal of popular music into musically meaningful sections at the beat level and classifies them into predefined categories such as intro, verse, and chorus, where beat times are assumed to be estimated in advance. A basic approach to this task is to train a recurrent neural network (e.g., long short-term memory (LSTM) network) that directly predicts section labels from acoustic features. This approach, however, suffers from frequent musically unnatural label switching because the homogeneity, repetitiveness, and duration regularity of musical sections are hard to represent explicitly in the network architecture. To solve this problem, we formulate a unified hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) that represents the generative process of homogeneous mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients, repetitive chroma features, and mel spectra from section labels, where the emission probabilities of mel spectra are computed from the posterior probabilities of section labels predicted by an LSTM. Given these acoustic features, the most likely label sequence can be estimated with Viterbi decoding. The experimental results show that the proposed LSTM-HSMM hybrid model outperformed a conventional HSMM."

If target musical pieces are always played by particular kinds of musical instruments, a way to obtain piano rolls is to compute the pitchgram (pitch saliency spectrogram) of each musical instrument by using a deep neural network (DNN). However, this approach has a critical limitation that it has no way to deal with musical pieces including undefined musical instruments. To overcome this limitation, we estimate a condensed pitchgram with an existing instrument-independent neural multi-pitch estimator and then separate the pitchgram into a specified number of musical instrument parts with a deep spherical clustering technique. To improve the performance of transcription, we propose a joint spectrogram and pitchgram clustering method based on the timbral and pitch characteristics of musical instruments. The experimental results show that the proposed method can transcribe musical pieces including unknown musical instruments as well as those containing only predefined instruments, at the state-of-the-art transcription accuracy."
2,Omar A Peracha,Improving polyphonic music models with feature-rich encoding,2020,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245396,Omar Peracha+Humtap>USA>company,"This paper explores sequential modelling of polyphonic music with deep neural networks. While recent breakthroughs have focussed on network architecture, we demonstrate that the representation of the sequence can make an equally significant contribution to the performance of the model as measured by validation set loss. By extracting salient features inherent to the training dataset, the model can either be conditioned on these features or trained to predict said features as extra components of the sequences being modelled. We show that training a neural network to predict a seemingly more complex sequence, with extra features included in the series being modelled, can improve overall model performance significantly. We first introduce TonicNet, a GRU-based model trained to initially predict the chord at a given time-step before then predicting the notes of each voice at that time-step, in contrast with the typical approach of predicting only the notes. We then evaluate TonicNet on the canonical JSB Chorales dataset and obtain state-of-the-art results."

These studies are commonly verified through self-reporting emotion-based surveys. This paper proposes the ""retention rate"" as an additional parameter for evaluation. The ""retention rate"" is one at which the listener revisits the novel items. The authors hypothesize that when a person listens to novel (i.e., both unfamiliar and interesting) pieces of music, the retention rate will be proportional to the number of times the discovery engine suggests the pieces to her, as long as they remain novel. The authors have tested the hypothesis through a six-week human-subject experiment that simulates a real-world listening environment and a follow-up survey. During the experiment period, each subject received, through Discover Weekly in Spotify, suggestions for novel songs up to three times and provided evaluation. One month after the evaluation experiment, the human-subjects answered whether they had revisited the novel songs. Through the analysis of the response and survey data, the researchers conclude that the more times a listener is exposed to a song during the discovery process, the more likely she is to return to the song."

One reason for this may be the lack of a generally accepted definition. In this paper, we discuss how to model and measure local tempo in a musically meaningful way using a cross-version dataset of Frédéric Chopin's Mazurkas as a use case. In particular, we explore how tempo stability can be measured and taken into account during evaluation. Comparing existing and newly trained systems, we find that CNN-based approaches can accurately measure local tempo even for expressive classical music, if trained on the target genre. Furthermore, we show that different training–test splits have a considerable impact on accuracy for difficult segments."

A prime example of this compositional technique is Richard Wagner's four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen. Across its different occurrences in the score, a leitmotif may undergo considerable musical variations. The concrete leitmotif instances in an audio recording are subject to acoustic variability. Our paper approaches the task of classifying such leitmotif instances in audio recordings. As our main contribution, we conduct a case study on a dataset covering 16 recorded performances of the Ring with annotations of ten central leitmotifs, leading to 2403 occurrences and 38448 instances in total. We build a neural network classification model and evaluate its ability to generalize across different performances and leitmotif occurrences. Our findings demonstrate the possibilities and limitations of leitmotif classification in audio recordings and pave the way towards the fully automated detection of leitmotifs in music recordings."
6,Timothy Tsai;Kevin Ji,Composer style classification of piano sheet music images using language model pretraining,2020,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245398,TJ Tsai+Harvey Mudd College>USA>education;Kevin Ji+Harvey Mudd College>USA>education,"This paper studies composer style classification of piano sheet music images.  Previous approaches to the composer classification task have been limited by a scarcity of data.  We address this issue in two ways: (1) we recast the problem to be based on raw sheet music images rather than a symbolic music format, and (2) we propose an approach that can be trained on unlabeled data.  Our approach first converts the sheet music image into a sequence of musical ``words"" based on the bootleg feature representation, and then feeds the sequence into a text classifier.  We show that it is possible to significantly improve classifier performance by first training a language model on a set of unlabeled data, initializing the classifier with the pretrained language model weights, and then finetuning the classifier on a small amount of labeled data.  We train AWD-LSTM, GPT-2, and RoBERTa language models on all piano sheet music images in IMSLP.  We find that transformer-based architectures outperform CNN and LSTM models, and pretraining boosts classification accuracy for the GPT-2 model from 46% to 70% on a 9-way classification task.  The trained model can also be used as a feature extractor that projects piano sheet music into a feature space that characterizes compositional style."
7,Frank Zalkow;Meinard Müller,Using weakly aligned score–audio pairs to train deep chroma models for cross-modal music retrieval,2020,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245400,Frank Zalkow+International Audio Laboratories Erlangen>DEU>facility;Meinard Müller+International Audio Laboratories Erlangen>DEU>facility,"Many music information retrieval tasks involve the comparison of a symbolic score representation with an audio recording. A typical strategy is to compare score–audio pairs based on a common mid-level representation, such as chroma features. Several recent studies demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning models that learn task-specific mid-level representations from temporally aligned training pairs. However, in practice, there is often a lack of strongly aligned training data, in particular for real-world scenarios. In our study, we use weakly aligned score–audio pairs for training, where only the beginning and end of a score excerpt is annotated in an audio recording, without aligned correspondences in between. To exploit such weakly aligned data, we employ the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss to train a deep learning model for computing an enhanced chroma representation. We then apply this model to a cross-modal retrieval task, where we aim at finding relevant audio recordings of Western classical music, given a short monophonic musical theme in symbolic notation as a query. We present systematic experiments that show the effectiveness of the CTC-based model for this theme-based retrieval task."
8,Daniel Yang;Timothy Tsai,Camera-based piano sheet music identification,2020,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245476,Daniel Yang+Harvey Mudd College>USA>education;TJ Tsai+Harvey Mudd College>USA>education,"This paper presents a method for large-scale retrieval of piano sheet music images.  Our work differs from previous studies on sheet music retrieval in two ways.  First, we investigate the problem at a much larger scale than previous studies, using all solo piano sheet music images in the entire IMSLP dataset as a searchable database.  Second, we use cell phone images of sheet music as our input queries, which lends itself to a practical, user-facing application.  We show that a previously proposed fingerprinting method for sheet music retrieval is far too slow for a real-time application, and we diagnose its shortcomings.  We propose a novel hashing scheme called dynamic n-gram fingerprinting that significantly reduces runtime while simultaneously boosting retrieval accuracy.  In experiments on IMSLP data, our proposed method achieves a mean reciprocal rank of 0.85 and an average runtime of 0.98 seconds per query."

Specifically, there is more to learn about what influences and behaviors individual music users perceive as meaningful in social contexts. We used the Q methodology to explore which behaviors and influences are important to CMS users and why. We extracted two factors that explain the two different viewpoints shared by groups of music users, focusing on how they perceive the meaning and value of different social music behavior and interactions. From these findings, we then revise an existing social music coding dictionary and interaction model and offer new CMS design insights."

Savage+Keio University>JPN>education","Music copyright lawsuits often result in multimillion dollar damage awards or settlements, yet there are few objective guidelines for applying copyright law in in-fringement claims involving musical works. Recent re-search has attempted to develop objective methods based on automated similarity algorithms, but there remains almost no data on the role of perceived similarity in mu-sic copyright decisions despite its crucial role in copy-right law. We collected perceptual data from 20 partici-pants for 17 adjudicated copyright cases from the USA and Japan after editing the disputed sections to contain either full audio, melody only, or lyrics only. Due to the historical emphasis in legal opinions on melody as the key criterion for deciding infringement, we predicted that listening to melody-only versions would result in percep-tual judgements that more closely matched actual past legal decisions. Surprisingly, however, we found no sig-nificant differences between the three conditions, with participants matching past decisions in between 50-60% of cases in all three conditions. Automated algorithms designed to calculate melodic and audio similarity pro-duced comparable results: both algorithms were able to match past decisions with identical accuracy of 71% (12/17 cases). Analysis of cases that were difficult to classify suggests that melody, lyrics, and other factors sometimes interact in complex ways difficult to capture using quantitative metrics. We propose directions for fur-ther investigation of the role of similarity in music copy-right law using larger and more diverse samples of cases and enhanced methods, and adapting our perceptual ex-periment method to avoid relying for ground truth data only on court decisions (which may be subject to selec-tion bias). Our results contribute to important practical debates, such as whether jury members should be allowed to listen to full audio recordings during copyright cases."

Kinnaird+Smith College>USA>education,"Accurate and flexible representations of music data are paramount to addressing MIR tasks, yet many of the existing approaches are difficult to interpret or rigid in nature. This work introduces two new song representations for structure-based retrieval methods: Surface Pattern Preservation (SuPP), a continuous song representation, and Matrix Pattern Preservation (MaPP), SuPP's discrete counterpart. These representations come equipped with several user-defined parameters so that they are adaptable for a range of MIR tasks. Experimental results show MaPP as successful in addressing the cover song task on a set of Mazurka scores, with a mean precision of 0.965 and recall of 0.776. SuPP and MaPP also show promise in other MIR applications, such as novel-segment detection and genre classification, the latter of which demonstrates their suitability as inputs for machine learning problems."

We also present a comparative study on automatic figured bass annotation using both rule-based and machine learning approaches, which respectively achieved classification accuracies of 85.3% and 85.9% on BCFB. Finally, we discuss promising areas for MIR research involving figured bass, including automatic harmonic analysis."
13,Phillip B Kirlin,A corpus-based analysis of syncopated patterns in ragtime,2020,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245514,Phillip B. Kirlin+Rhodes College>USA>education,"In this paper, we build on and extend a number of previous studies of rhythmic patterns that occur in ragtime music.  All of these studies have used the RAG-C dataset of approximately 11,000 symbolically-encoded ragtime pieces to identify salient rhythmic patterns in the corpus and  qualify how they are used.  Ragtime music is distinguished from other musical genres by frequent use of syncopation, and previous computational studies have confirmed a number of musicological hypotheses regarding the use of syncopated patterns in ragtime compositions.  In this work, we extend these studies to investigate further questions involving the use of syncopation.  Specifically, we introduce a new methodological framework for processing the RAG-C dataset and confirm that experiments from previous studies obtain similar results using the new methodology.  We investigate the use of the common ``short-long-short'' syncopated pattern in different time periods and present new results detailing its use by three well-known ragtime composers.  We describe how the use of other syncopated patterns has evolved over time and the different distributions of patterns that result from those changes.  Lastly, we present novel results identifying statistically significant patterns in the way composers varied the amount of syncopation in consecutive measures in compositions."

Wiggins+Vrije Universiteit Brussel>BEL>education;Mark B. Sandler+Queen Mary University of London>GBR>education,"While common approaches to automatic structural analysis of music typically focus on individual audio files, our approach collates audio features of large sets of related files in order to find a shared musical temporal structure. The content of each individual file and the differences between them can then be described in relation to this shared structure. We first construct a large similarity graph of temporal segments, such as beats or bars, based on self-alignments and selected pair-wise alignments between the given input files. Part of this graph is then partitioned into groups of corresponding segments using multiple sequence alignment. This partitioned graph is searched for recurring sections which can be organized hierarchically based on their co-occurrence. We apply our approach to discover shared harmonic structure in a dataset containing a large number of different live performances of a number of songs. Our evaluation shows that using the joint information from a number of files has the advantage of evening out the noisiness or inaccuracy of the underlying feature data and leads to a robust estimate of shared musical material."

In this paper, we introduce a variety of intermediate spectrogram transformation blocks. We implement U-nets based on these blocks and train them on complex-valued spectrograms to consider both magnitude and phase. These networks are then compared on the SDR metric. When using a particular block composed of convolutional and fully-connected layers, it achieves state-of-the-art SDR on the MUSDB singing voice separation task by a large margin of 0.9 dB. Our code and models are available online."

Based on incoming audio and a given image of the score, our system directly predicts the most likely position within the page that matches the audio, outperforming current state-of-the-art image-based score followers in terms of alignment precision. We also compare our method to an OMR-based approach and empirically show that it can be a viable alternative to such a system."

The network is trained with both reconstruction and adversarial objectives on a synthetic noisy music dataset, which is created by mixing clean music with real noise samples extracted from quiet segments of old recordings. We evaluate our method quantitatively on held-out test examples of the synthetic dataset, and qualitatively by human rating on samples of actual historical recordings. Our results show that the proposed method is effective in removing noise, while preserving the quality and details of the original music."

We exploit these visualizations of diatonic scale content by discussing their musicological implications, being aware of methodological limitations as for the case of minor keys. As a proof of concept, we use this method for investigating differences between the traditional sonata-form model and selected Beethoven piano sonatas in the context of sonata theory from the end of the 18th century. We consider this scenario as an example for a rewarding dialogue between computer science and historical musicology."

To better understand user motivations for making NSQs, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with voice users.

A disruptive object is one that creates a new stream of events, changing the traditional way of how a context usually works. The proper measurement of disruption remains as a task with large room for improvement, and these gaps are even more evident in the music domain, where the topic has not received much attention so far. This work builds on preliminary studies focused on the analysis of music disruption derived from metadata-based similarity networks, demonstrating that the raw audio can augment similarity information. We developed a case study based on a collection of a Brazilian local music tradition called Forró, that emphasizes the analytical and musicological potential of the musical disruption metric to describe and explain a genre trajectory over time."

The resulting features also turn out to be efficient for structural segmentation, leading to experimental results on the RWC Pop data set which are potentially challenging state-of-the-art approaches that rely on extensive example-based learning schemes."

Although chorus-section detection using audio signals has been studied, whether chorus sections can be detected from text-only lyrics is an open issue. Another open issue is whether patterns of repeating lyric lines such as those appearing in chorus sections depend on language. To investigate these issues, we propose a neural network-based model for sequence labeling. It can learn phrase repetition and linguistic features to detect chorus sections in lyrics text. It is, however, difficult to train this model since there was no dataset of lyrics with chorus-section annotations as there was no prior work on this task. We therefore generate a large amount of training data with such annotations by leveraging pairs of musical audio signals and their corresponding manually time-aligned lyrics; we first automatically detect chorus sections from the audio signals and then use their temporal positions to transfer them to the line-level chorus-section annotations for the lyrics. Experimental results show that the proposed model with the generated data contributes to detecting the chorus sections, that the model trained on Japanese lyrics can detect chorus sections surprisingly well in English lyrics and that patterns of repeating lyric lines are language-independent."

Such a generation process inevitably requires reference from the original melody, chord progression, or other structural information. Despite some promising models for arrangement, they lack more refined data to achieve better evaluations and more practical results. In this paper, we propose POP909, a dataset which contains multiple versions of the piano arrangements of 909 popular songs created by professional musicians. The main body of the dataset contains the vocal melody, the lead instrument melody, and the piano accompaniment for each song in MIDI format, which are aligned to the original audio files. Furthermore, we provide the annotations of tempo, beat, key, and chords, where the tempo curves are hand-labeled and others are done by MIR algorithms. Finally, we conduct several baseline experiments with this dataset using standard deep music generation algorithms."

In spite of its convenience, the chord symbol notation only provides basic information about the chordal configuration, and leaves much room for interpretation. With such limitations, an algorithm generating merely chord symbols is usually insufficient for a wide range of music genres such as jazz. To solve this problem, we propose chord jazzification, a process to generate realistic chord configurations in jazz style. With deep learning approaches, we decompose chord jazzification into coloring and voicing. Coloring concerns the choice of color tones, while voicing concerns the configurations of chords. We also create a new dataset featuring interpretations of chord symbols in pop-jazz compositions. By conducting experiments on the new dataset, we show that 1) the two-stage process outperforms an end-to-end generation approach in modeling chord configurations, and 2) attention-based models are better at capturing the structure of chord sequences in comparison with recurrent neural networks."

The current model focuses on learning 8-beat long piano composition segments. We show that such chord-texture disentanglement provides a controllable generation pathway leading to a wide spectrum of applications, including compositional style transfer, texture variation, and accompaniment arrangement. Both objective and subjective evaluations show that our method achieves a successful disentanglement and high quality controlled music generation."

In short, our model connects and fuses two contextually unrelated sequences in a coherent way. This transformation can be applied iteratively to gradually fuse the input sequences. The style latent space is simultaneously learned, allowing users to control how the two sequences are merged. Our approach comprises two steps of unsupervised learning: a deep generative model with a latent space is learned, followed by adversarial learning of the transformation function in the latent space. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method through the task of melody creation using a symbolic music dataset."

Future multimodal MIR systems may benefit from taking these aspects into account. The current study addresses this by identifying individual differences, specifically Big Five personality traits, and scores on the Empathy and Systemizing Quotients (EQ/SQ) from participants' free dance movements. Our model successfully explored the unseen space for personality as well as EQ, SQ, which has not previously been accomplished for the latter. R2 scores for personality, EQ, and SQ were 76.3%, 77.1%, and 86.7% respectively. As a follow-up, we investigated which bodily joints were most important in defining these traits. We discuss how further research may explore how the mapping of these traits to movement patterns can be used to build a more personalized, multi-modal recommendation system, as well as potential therapeutic applications."

However, most approaches do not provide any form of interpretable control over musical attributes, such as pitch and rhythm. Obtaining control over the generation process is critically important for its use in real-life creative setups. Nevertheless, this problem remains arduous, as there are no known functions nor differentiable approximations to transform symbolic music with control of musical attributes.In this work, we propose a novel method that enables attributes-aware music transformation from any set of musical annotations, without requiring complicated derivative implementation. By relying on an adversarial confusion criterion on given musical annotations, we force the latent space of a generative model to abstract from these features. Then, reintroducing these features as conditioning to the generative function, we obtain a continuous control over them. To demonstrate our approach, we rely on sets of musical attributes computed by the jSymbolic library as annotations and conduct experiments that show that our method outperforms previous methods in control. Finally, comparing correlations between attributes and the transformed results show that our method can provide explicit control over any continuous or discrete annotation."

This allows us to deconstruct the same mixture in multiple ways, depending on the appropriate level of the hierarchy for a given application. In this paper, we present various methods for hierarchical musical instrument separation, with some methods focusing on separating specific instruments (like guitars) and other methods that determine what to separate based on a user-supplied audio example.

However, without a parallel corpus, previous solutions could not handle tag systems in other languages, being limited to the English-language only. Here, by learning multilingual music genre embeddings, we enable cross-lingual music genre translation without relying on a parallel corpus. First, we apply compositionality functions on pre-trained word embeddings to represent multi-word tags. Second, we adapt the tag representations to the music domain by leveraging multilingual music genres graphs with a modified retrofitting algorithm. Experiments show that our method: 1) is effective in translating music genres across tag systems in multiple languages (English, French and Spanish); 2) outperforms the previous baseline in an English-language multi-source translation task."

One of the most important features of this structure is the organisation of modulations between different keys throughout a piece. Music theoretical research has established taxonomies of prototypical modulation plans for different modes and musical forms. However, these prototypes still require empirical validation based on quantitative statistical methods and cannot be retrieved automatically so far.In this paper, we present a novel method to infer prototypical modulation plans from musical corpora. A modulation plan is formalised as a transposition-invariant probabilistic model over the underlying pitch class distributions based on a hierarchical pitch scape representation. Prototypical modulation plans can be learned in an unsupervised manner by training a mixture model (similar to a Gaussian mixture model) on the data, so that different prototypes appear as distinct clusters.We evaluate our approach by performing hierarchical clustering on a corpus of more than 150 Baroque pieces, with the extracted clusters showing excellent agreement with the most common prototypes postulated in music theory. Our method bears a great potential for modelling, analysis and discovery of hierarchical key structure and prototypes in corpora across a broad range of musical styles.

To do this, we use the co-listen–based audio embeddings as inputs to small attribute classifiers, trained on a small hand-labeled dataset. These classifiers map from the original embedding space to a new interpretable attribute coordinate system that provides a more useful distance measure for downstream applications. The attributes and attribute embeddings allow us to provide a search interface and more intelligible recommendations for music curators.

We focus on the task of symbol-based, monophonic, harmony-constrained jazz improvisations. Our personalization pipeline begins with BebopNet, a music language model trained on a corpus of jazz improvisations by Bebop giants. BebopNet is able to generate improvisations based on any given chord progression. We then assemble a personalized dataset, labeled by a specific user, and train a user-specific metric that reflects this user's unique musical taste. Finally, we employ a personalized variant of beam-search with BebopNet to optimize the generated jazz improvisations for that user. We present an extensive empirical study in which we apply this pipeline to extract individual models as implicitly defined by several human listeners. Our approach enables an objective examination of subjective personalized models whose performance is quantifiable. The results indicate that it is possible to model and optimize personal jazz preferences and offer a foundation for future research in personalized generation of art.

One approach for improving the browsing experience is music thumbnailing: the procedure of finding a continuous fragment that can represent the whole musical piece. This paper proposes a human-centred approach to creating thumbnails based on listeners' perception, directly asking listeners to identify the most characteristic fragment. We carried out a user study to assign representativeness scores to multiple fragments from a selection of popular music tracks. To strengthen the results, we performed a replication of the same user study with new participants and a different set of music. Thereafter, we used audio features, the segmentation algorithm, and participants' overall familiarity with the songs to predict representativeness scores. The results suggest that neither segmentation nor familiarity have a significant impact on users' thumbnail preferences: even segments with starting points that pay no regard to song structure can be suitable thumbnails. Three high-level audio characteristics, however, do impact the perceived representativeness of a fragment: Raw Intensity, Melodic Conventionality, and Conventionally of Intensity. Based on these findings, we propose a new, easy-to-apply method for music thumbnailing."

We show that Wave-U-Net outperforms a baseline implemented using score-informed NMF (non-negative matrix factorization). We introduce score-informed Wave-U-Net to incorporate the musical score into the separation process. We experiment with different score conditioning methods and show that conditioning on the score leads to improved separation results. We propose a 'score-guided' model variant in which separation is guided by the score alone, bypassing the need to specify the identity of the extracted source. Finally, we evaluate our models (trained on synthetic data only) on real choir recordings and find that in the absence of a large training set of real recordings, NMF still performs better than Wave-U-Net in this setting. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to study source separation of choral music."

Liem+Delft University of Technology>NLD>education;Chris Mostert+Delft University of Technology>NLD>education,"Copyright restrictions prevent the widespread sharing of commercial music audio. Therefore, the availability of resharable pre-computed music audio features has become critical. In line with this, the AcousticBrainz platform offers a dynamically growing, open and community-contributed large-scale resource of locally computed low-level and high-level music descriptors. Beyond enabling research reuse, the availability of such an open resource allows for renewed reflection on the music descriptors we have at hand: while they were validated to perform successfully under lab conditions, they now are being run 'in the wild'. Their response to these more ecological conditions can shed light on the degree to which they truly had construct validity. In this work, we seek to gain further understanding into this, by analyzing high-level classifier-based music descriptor output in AcousticBrainz. While no hard ground truth is available on what the true value of these descriptors should be, some oracle information can still be derived, relying on semantic redundancies between several descriptors, and multiple feature submissions being available for the same recording. We report on multiple unexpected patterns found in the data, indicating that the descriptor values should not be taken as absolute truth, and hinting at directions for more comprehensive descriptor testing that are overlooked in common machine learning evaluation and quality assurance setups."

Whereas previous works focus on synthetic sheet music where the data has been cleaned and preprocessed, we instead focus on developing a system that can cope with the messiness of raw, unprocessed sheet music PDFs from IMSLP.  We investigate how well existing systems cope with real scanned sheet music, filler pages and unrelated pieces or movements, and discontinuities due to jumps and repeats.  We find that a significant bottleneck in system performance is handling jumps and repeats correctly.  In particular, we find that a previously proposed Jump DTW algorithm does not perform robustly when jump locations are unknown a priori.  We propose a novel alignment algorithm called Hierarchical DTW that can handle jumps and repeats even when jump locations are not known.  It first performs alignment at the feature level on each sheet music line, and then performs a second alignment at the segment level.  By operating at the segment level, it is able to encode domain knowledge about how likely a particular jump is.  Through carefully controlled experiments on unprocessed sheet music PDFs from IMSLP, we show that Hierarachical DTW significantly outperforms Jump DTW in handling various types of jumps."

This not only facilitates the collection of suitable singing voice data, but also allows networks to be pretrained on large speech corpora before being refined on singing voice datasets, improving network generalization.

The visual analysis of dances is important to achieve general machine understanding of dances, not limited to dance music. As a sub-area of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) research, DIR also shares similar goals with MIR and needs to extract various high-level semantics from dance videos. While audio-based beat tracking has been thoroughly studied in MIR, there has not been visual-based beat tracking for dance videos.We approach dance beat tracking as a time series classification problem and conduct several experiments using a Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TCN) using the AIST Dance Video Database. We evaluate the proposed solution considering different data splits based on either ""dancer"" or ""music"". Moreover, we propose a periodicity-based loss that considerably improves the overall beat tracking performance according to several evaluation metrics."

First, we introduce SketchVAE, a novel variational autoencoder that explicitly factorizes rhythm and pitch contour to form the basis of our proposed model. Then we introduce two discriminative architectures, SketchInpainter and SketchConnector, that in conjunction perform the guided music completion, filling in representations for the missing measures conditioned on surrounding context and user-specified snippets. We evaluate SketchNet on a standard dataset of Irish folk music and compare with models from recent works. When used for music completion, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art both in terms of objective metrics and subjective listening tests. Finally, we demonstrate that our model can successfully incorporate user-specified snippets during the generation process."

In this study, we aim to better understand the contextual complexities surrounding music fans through a case study of the group BTS and its fan community, ARMY. In particular, we are interested in discovering factors that influence the interactions of music fans with music services, especially in the current environment where the prevalence of social media and other tools/technologies influences musical enjoyment. Through virtual ethnography and content analysis, we identified four factors that affect music fans' interactions with commercial music services: 1) perception of music genres, 2) participatory fandom, 3) desire for agency and transparency, and 4) importance of non-musical factors. The discussion of each aspect is followed by design implications for commercial music services to consider."

Second, while still relatively low, we found that recommendation-based streaming has a slightly higher proportion of female creators than ""organic"" listening (i.e., tracks that are not recommended by editors or algorithms). Third, we examined streaming data from 200,000 US users to determine the proportion of female artists in organic and recommended streams over a 28-day period and the relationship between recommended streams and users' future organic listening. The proportion of female artists in recommended streaming appears predictive of the proportion of female artists in organic streaming; these effects are moderated by gender and age. Fourth, this study also samples creators across different popularity levels, seeing more female and multi-gender groups at lower levels than in the middle tiers. However, solo female artists are better represented again in the superstars category, suggesting influence of selected superstars and genres.

The question now remains whether the increase of performance is actually due to the phonetic contents that lie in the informed aligned lyrics or not. To this end, we investigated the source of performance increase in multifaceted ways by observing the change of performance when incorrect lyrics were given to the model. Experiment results show that the model can use not only just vocal activity information but also the phonetic contents from the aligned lyrics."

First, we analyze the perception of beat and meter by asking 10 Colombian musicians to perform beat annotations in a dataset of bambucos. Results show  great diversity in the annotations: a total of five different meters or meter combinations were found in the annotations, with each bambuco in the study being annotated in at least two different meters. Second, we perform a beat tracking analysis in a dataset of bambucos with two state-of-the-art algorithms.  Given that the algorithms used in the analysis were designed to deal with the rhythmic regularity of a single meter, it is not surprising that tracking performance is not very high (~42% mean F-measure). However, a deeper analysis of  the onset detection functions used for beat tracking, indicate that there is enough information on the signal level to characterize the bi-metric behavior of bambucos. With this in mind, we highlight possibilities for computational analysis of rhythm in bambucos."

Existing methods for instrumental playing technique detection mostly focus on the local features extracted from audio. However, we argue that structural information is critical for both global and local tasks, particularly considering the characteristics of Guqin music. Incorporating mode and playing technique analysis, this study demonstrates that the structural relationship between notes is crucial for detecting mode, and such information also provides extra guidance for the playing technique detection in local-level. In this study, a new dataset is compiled for Guqin performance analysis. The mode detection is achieved by pattern matching, and the predicted results are conjoined with audio features to be inputted into a neural network for playing technique detection. Advanced techniques are developed to optimize the extracted pitch contour from the audio. It is manifest in the results that the global and local features are inter-connected in Guqin music. Our analysis identifies key components affecting the recognition of mode and playing technique, and challenging cases resulting from unique properties in Guqin audio signal are discussed for further research."

This capability is essential to many meaningful applications that synchronize audio with a score in an on-line fashion. Existing algorithms often stumble on certain difficult cases, one of which is piano music. This paper presents a new method to tackle such cases. The method treats tempo as a variable rather than a constant (with constraints), allowing the program to adapt to live performance variations. This is first expressed by a Kalman filter model at the note level, and then by an almost equivalent switching state-space model at the audio frame level. The latter contains both discrete and continuous hidden variables, and is computationally intractable. We show how certain reasonable approximations make the computation manageable. This new method is tested on a dataset of 50 piano excerpts. Compared with a previously established state-of-the-art algorithm, the new method shows more stable and accurate results: it reduces fatal score-following errors, and improves accuracy from 65.0% to 69.1%."

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a solution to alleviate the issue by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose an SSL method using teacher-student models for vocal melody extraction. The teacher model is pre-trained with labeled data and guides the student model to make identical predictions given unlabeled input in a self-training setting. We examine three setups of teacher-student models with different data augmentation schemes and loss functions. Also, considering the scarcity of labeled data in the test phase, we artificially generate large-scale testing data with pitch labels from unlabeled data using an analysis-synthesis method. The results show that the SSL method significantly increases the performance against supervised learning only and the improvement depends on the teacher-student models, the size of unlabeled data, the number of self-training iterations, and other training details. We also find that it is essential to ensure that the unlabeled audio has vocal parts. Finally, we show that the proposed SSL method allows a simple convolutional recurrent neural network model to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-arts."

In this paper, we propose a framework that achieves unsupervised pitch and timbre disentanglement for isolated musical instrument sounds without relying on data annotations or pre-trained neural networks. Our framework, based on variational auto-encoders, takes as input a spectral frame, and encodes pitch and timbre as categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The input is then reconstructed by combining those variables. Under an unsupervised training setting, a major challenge is that encoders are tasked to capture factors of interest with distinct latent representations, without access to the corresponding ground-truth labels. We therefore introduce auxiliary tasks and objectives which leverage pitch shifting as a strategy to create surrogate labels, thereby encouraging the disentanglement of pitch and timbre. Through an ablation study we analyze the impact of the proposed objectives. The evaluation shows the efficacy of the proposed framework for learning disentangled representations, and verifies its applicability to unsupervised pitch classification and conditional spectral synthesis."

Inspired by this concept, we propose a preference-based framework to generate a relative rank-ordering of singing vocals, and therefore, singers. We adopt a twin-neural network (Siamese) that learns to choose a preferred candidate in terms of singing quality between two inputs. With a few such pairwise comparisons, this method generates a relative rank-order of a complete list of singers. Additionally, we incorporate a knowledge-based musically-relevant pitch histogram representation, as a conditioning vector, to provide explicit musical information to the network. The experiments show that this method is able to reliably evaluate singing quality and rank-order singing vocals, independent of the song or the singer. The results suggest that the twin-neural network learns the underlying discerning properties relevant to singing quality, instead of being specific to the content of a song or singer."

In this paper, we present findings on what 13 musician/developer teams, a total of 61 users, needed when co-creating a song with AI, the challenges they faced, and how they leveraged and repurposed existing characteristics of AI to overcome some of these challenges. Many teams adopted modular approaches, such as independently running multiple smaller models that align with the musical building blocks of a song, before re-combining their results. As ML models are not easily steerable, teams also generated massive numbers of samples and curated them post-hoc, or used a range of strategies to direct the generation or algorithmically ranked the samples. Ultimately, teams not only had to manage the ``flare and focus'' aspects of the creative process, but also juggle that with a parallel process of exploring and curating multiple ML models and outputs. These findings reflect a need to design machine learning-powered music interfaces that are more decomposable, steerable, interpretable, and adaptive, which in return will enable artists to more effectively explore how AI can extend their personal expression."

To this end, by embedding song/artist vectors into the same feature space, we first propose two concepts of artist-song relationships: overall similarity and prominent affinity. Overall similarity is the degree to which the characteristics of a song are similar overall to the characteristics of the artist; while prominent affinity is the degree to which a song prominently represents the characteristics of the artist. By using Last.fm play logs for two years, we analyze the characteristics of the concepts. Moreover, based on the analysis results, we propose three applications for song search.

We hypothesize that models trained for these tasks can be useful in (for example) improving automatic music transcription performance if applied as a post-processing step. To that end, MDTK includes a script that measures the distribution of different types of errors in a transcription, and creates a degraded dataset with similar properties. MDTK's degradations can also be applied dynamically to a dataset during training (with or without the above script), generating novel degraded excerpts each epoch. MDTK could also be used to test the robustness of any system designed to take MIDI (or similar) data as input (e.g. systems designed for voice separation, metrical alignment, or chord detection) to such transcription errors or otherwise noisy data. The toolkit and dataset are both publicly available online, and we encourage contribution and feedback from the community."

We modify the original lottery approach to allow for explicitly removing parameters, through structured trimming of entire units, instead of simply masking individual weights. This allows to obtain models which are effectively lighter in terms of size, memory and number of operations.We show that our proposal allows to remove up to 95% of the models parameters without loss of accuracy, leading to ultra-light deep MIR models. We confirm the surprising result that, at smaller compression ratios (removing up to 90% of the network), lighter models consistently outperform their heavier counterpart. We exhibit these results on a large array of MIR tasks including audio classification, pitch recognition, chord extraction, drum transcription and onset estimation. These resulting ultra-light deep models for MIR can run on CPU, and can even fit on embedded devices with minimal degradation of accuracy."

The automation of this process has been object of study for a long time in the field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR), with a wide variety of proposed solutions. Currently, there is a tendency to use machine learning strategies based on neural networks because of their high performance and flexibility to adapt to different scenarios by changing only the training data. However, most of the recent literature addresses only specific parts of the traditional OMR workflow such as music object detection or symbol classification. In this paper, we progress one step further by proposing a full-page OMR system for Mensural notation scores that consists of simply two processes, which are enough to extract the symbolic music information from a full page. More precisely, our pipeline uses Selectional Auto-Encoders to extract single staff regions, combined with end-to-end staff-level recognition based on Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for retrieving the music notation. The results confirm the adequacy of our method, reporting a successful behavior on two Mensural collections (Capitan and Seils datasets) with a straightforward implementation."

As part of the GrooveToolbox we introduce two new metrics of rhythm similarity and four new features for describing the perceptually salient properties of microtiming deviations in drum loops. Based on a two-part perceptual evaluation, we show these four new microtiming features can each correlate to similarity perception, and be used along with rhythm similarity metrics to improve personalized similarity models for complex drum loops. A new measure of structural rhythmic similarity is also shown to correlate more strongly to similarity perception of drum loops than the more commonly used Hamming distance. These results point to the potential application of the GrooveToolbox and its new features in drum loop analysis for intelligent music production tools.

This paper discusses surprisal based music representation learning with a hierarchical predictive neural network. In order to inspect the cognitive validity of the network's predictions along their time-scales, we use the network's prediction error to segment electroencephalograms (EEG) based on the audio signal. Using the NMED-T dataset on passive natural music listening we explore the automatic segmentation of audio and EEG into events using the suggested model. By averaging only the EEG signal at predicted locations, we were able to visualize auditory evoked potentials connected to local and global musical structures. This indicates the potential of unsupervised predictive learning with deep neural networks as means to retrieve musical structure from audio and as a basis to uncover the corresponding cognitive processes in the human brain."

Given these difficulties, it is not easy to learn good feature representations with supervised learning techniques, either because of the insufficiency of labels, or the subjectiveness (and hence large variance) in human-annotated labels. In this paper, we present a framework that can learn high-level feature representations with a limited amount of data, by first modelling their corresponding quantifiable low-level attributes. We refer to our proposed framework as Music FaderNets, which is inspired by the fact that low-level attributes can be continuously manipulated by separate ""sliding faders"" through feature disentanglement and latent regularization techniques. High-level features are then inferred from the low-level representations through semi-supervised clustering using Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders (GM-VAEs). Using arousal as an example of a high-level feature, we show that the ""faders"" of our model are disentangled and change linearly w.r.t. the modelled low-level attributes of the generated output music. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model successfully learns the intrinsic relationship between arousal and its corresponding low-level attributes (rhythm and note density), with only 1% of the training set being labelled. Finally, using the learnt high-level feature representations, we explore the application of our framework in style transfer tasks across different arousal states. The effectiveness of this approach is verified through a subjective listening test."

To train a model, we need a large set of loops with ground truth compatibility values. No such dataset exists, so we extract loops from existing music to obtain positive examples of compatible loops, and propose and compare various strategies for choosing negative examples. For reproducibility, we curate data from the Free Music Archive. Using this data, we investigate two types of model architectures for estimating the compatibility of loops: one based on a Siamese network, and the other a pure convolutional neural network (CNN). We conducted a user study in which participants rated the quality of the combinations suggested by each model, and found the CNN to outperform the Siamese network. Both model-based approaches outperformed the rule-based one. We have opened source the code for building the models and the dataset."

We study whether we can classify mode in a corpus of 20,865 medieval plainchant melodies from the Cantus database. We revisit the traditional 'textbook' classification approach (using the final, the range and initial note) as well as the only prior computational study we are aware of, which uses pitch profiles. Both approaches work well, but largely reduce modes to scales and ignore their melodic character. Our main contribution is a model that reaches 93–95% F1 score on mode classification, compared to 86–90% using traditional pitch-based musicological methods. Importantly, it reaches 81–83% even when we discard all absolute pitch information and reduce a melody to its contour. The model uses tf–idf vectors and strongly depends on the choice of units: i.e., how the melody is segmented. If we borrow the syllable or word structure from the lyrics, the model outperforms all of our baselines. This suggests that, like language, music is made up of 'natural' units, in our case between the level of notes and complete phrases, a finding that may well be useful in other musics."

Specifically, we use both the audio content and user information extracted from the user listening history to predict contextual tags for a given user/track pair. We propose a new dataset of music tracks annotated with contextual tags per user.

Specifically, we conduct a user study to answer three questions. Firstly, do most users agree which songs are most acoustically similar? Secondly, is acoustic similarity a good proxy for how an individual might construct a playlist or recommend music to a friend? Thirdly, if so, can we find acoustic features that are related to human judgments of acoustic similarity? To answer these questions, our study asked 117 test subjects to compare two unknown candidate songs relative to a third known reference song. Our findings show that 1) judgments about acoustic similarity are fairly consistent, 2) acoustic similarity is highly correlated with playlist selection and recommendation, but not necessarily personal preference, and 3) we identify a subset of acoustic features from the Spotify Web API that is particularly predictive of human similarity judgments."

Our approach allows the model to fix previous mistakes such as incorrectly sampled notes and prevent accumulation of errors which autoregressive models are prone to have. Another benefit of our approach is a finer degree of control during human and AI collaboration as our approach is notewise online.

The most commonly practiced setting for choir ensembles consists of four parts; Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass (SATB), each with its own range of fundamental frequencies (F0s). The task of source separation for this choral setting entails separating the SATB mixture into the constituent parts. Source separation for musical mixtures is well studied and many deep learning based methodologies have been proposed for the same. However, most of the research has been focused on a typical case which consists in separating vocal, percussion and bass sources from a mixture, each of which has a distinct spectral structure. In contrast, the simultaneous and harmonic nature of ensemble singing leads to high structural similarity and overlap between the spectral components of the sources in a choral mixture, making source separation for choirs a harder task than the typical case. This, along with the lack of an appropriate consolidated dataset has led to a dearth of research in the field so far. In this paper we first assess how well some of the recently developed methodologies for musical source separation perform for the case of SATB choirs. We then propose a novel domain-specific adaptation for conditioning the recently proposed U-Net architecture for musical source separation using the fundamental frequency contour of each of the singing groups and demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses results from domain-agnostic architectures."

More specifically, listeners were asked to describe, using freely chosen words (preferably: adjectives), how they perceive the expressive character of the different performances. In this paper, we offer a first account of this new data resource for expressive performance research, and provide an exploratory analysis, addressing three main questions: (1) how similarly do different listeners describe a performance of a piece? (2) what are the main dimensions (or axes) for expressive character emerging from this?; and (3) how do measurable parameters of a performance (e.g., tempo, dynamics) and mid- and high-level features that can be predicted by machine learning models (e.g., articulation, arousal) relate to these expressive dimensions? The dataset that we publish along with this paper was enriched by adding hand-corrected score-to-performance alignments, as well as descriptive audio features such as tempo and dynamics curves."

To this end, we create a dataset comprising of 2-bar monophonic melodies where each melody is the result of a unique combination of nine latent factors that span ordinal, categorical, and binary types.

Two central methods for representation learning include deep metric learning and classification, both having the same goal of learning a representation that can generalize well across tasks. Along with generalization, the emerging concept of disentangled representations is also of great interest, where multiple semantic concepts (e.g., genre, mood, instrumentation) are learned jointly but remain separable in the learned representation space. In this paper we present a single representation learning framework that elucidates the relationship between metric learning, classification, and disentanglement in a holistic manner. For this, we (1) outline past work on the relationship between metric learning and classification, (2) extend this relationship to multi-label data by exploring three different learning approaches and their disentangled versions, and (3) evaluate all models on four tasks (training time, similarity retrieval, auto-tagging, and triplet prediction). We find that classification-based models are generally advantageous for training time, similarity retrieval, and auto-tagging, while deep metric learning exhibits better performance for triplet-prediction. Finally, we show that our proposed approach yields state-of-the-art results for music auto-tagging."

In our study, 17 participants interacted with and rated the suggestions from two different recommendation systems. One provided static top-7 collaborative filtering recommendations, and the other provided an interactive slider to re-rank these recommendations based on a continuous diversity scale. We also asked participants a series of free-form questions on music discovery and diversity in semi-structured interviews. User-preferred levels of diversity varied widely both within and between subjects. Although most users agreed that diversity is beneficial in music discovery, they also noted a risk of dissatisfaction from too much diversity. A key finding is that preference for diversification was often linked to user mood. Participants also expressed a clear distinction between diversity within existing preferences, and outside of existing preferences. These ideas of inner and outer diversity are not well defined within the bounds of current diversity metrics, and we discuss their implications."

Music genres are valuable information, especially for music organization, personalized listening experience, and playlist generation. Automatically classifying music genres is a challenging endeavor due to the inherent ambiguity and subjectivity. Most efforts on music genre classification consider the complete independence between labels. However, music genres typically respect a hierarchical structure based on the influences or origins of each style. Conversely, many of the methods available for hierarchical classification are based on assumptions about the class hierarchy, such as the need for multiple children in each hierarchy's node, which may limit their use in music applications. Also, the local classifier per node approach that would be the most suitable for this scenario is costly regarding time and memory. In this paper, we present two local hierarchical classification approaches and show how to combine them to obtain a single one that is more robust and faithful to the music genre classification scenario. We evaluate our proposal in a music dataset hierarchically labeled with 120 music genres. As shown, compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our approach has a lower computational cost and can achieve competitive performances."

In this paper, we propose a unified neural network architecture where multiple note states are predicted as a softmax output with a single loss function and the temporal order is learned by an auto-regressive connection within the single neural network. This compact model allows to increase note states without architectural complexity. Using the MAESTRO dataset, we examine various combinations of multiple note states including on, onset, sustain, re-onset, offset, and off. We also show that the autoregressive module effectively learns inter-state dependency of notes.

To address this, a variety of memory efficient algorithms exist to approximate the optimal alignment under the DTW cost. To our knowledge, however, no exact algorithms exist that are guaranteed to break the quadratic memory barrier.  In this work, we present a divide and conquer algorithm that computes the exact globally optimal DTW alignment using O(M+N) memory. Its runtime is still O(MN), trading off memory for a 2x increase in computation.  However, the algorithm can be parallelized up to a factor of min(M, N) with the same memory constraints, so it can still run more efficiently than the textbook version with an adequate GPU. We use our algorithm to compute exact alignments on a collection of orchestral music, which we use as ground truth to benchmark the alignment accuracy of several popular approximate alignment schemes at scales that were not previously possible."

We find that the LSTM based attention models perform better than the state of the art transformers for the dynamic emotion prediction task, both in terms of R2 and Kendall-Tau metrics. We explore individual smaller feature sets in search of a more effective one and to understand how different features contribute to perceived emotion. The spectral features are found to perform at par with the generic ComPare feature set [1].

This enables the specification of a rhythmic structural similarity measure on drum patterns, where reduced patterns are compared through alignment. The two-state representation allows a low computational cost alignment, once the complex topological formalization is fully taken into account. A comparison with the Hamming distance, as well as similarity ratings collected from listeners on a drum loop dataset, indicates that the bistate reduction enables to convey subtle aspects that goes beyond surface-level comparison of rhythmic textures."

However, the exact relationship between real-world events and the sentiment of music being listened to is not clear. Driven by this research gap, we use the unexpected outbreak of COVID-19 as a natural experiment to explore how users' sentiment of music being listened to evolves before and during the outbreak of the pandemic. We employ causal inference approaches on an extended version of the LFM-1b dataset of listening events shared on Last.fm, to examine the impact of the pandemic on the sentiment of music listened to by users in different countries. We find that, after the first COVID-19 case in a country was confirmed, the sentiment of artists users listened to becomes more negative. This negative effect is pronounced for males while females' music emotion is less influenced by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We further find a negative association between the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases and users' music sentiment.

The model formulates a generative grammar of symbolic rhythmic musical structure and its internal recursive substructure. The approach characterizes rhythmic groups in alignment with meter in terms of the recursive subdivision of temporal units, as well as dependencies established by recursive operations such as preparation and different kinds of shifting (such as anticipation and delay). The model is formulated in terms of an abstract context-free grammar and applies for monophonic rhythms and harmonic rhythm."
