0,Karin Dressler,An Auditory Streaming Approach for Melody Extraction from Polyphonic Music.,2011,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416112,Karin Dressler+Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology IDMT>DEU>facility,"This paper proposes an efficient approach for the identification of the predominant voice from polyphonic musical audio. The algorithm implements an auditory streaming model which builds upon tone objects and salient pitches. The formation of voices is based on the regular update of the frequency and the magnitude of so called streaming agents, which aim at salient tones or pitches close to their preferred frequency range. Streaming agents which succeed to assemble a big magnitude start new voice objects, which in turn add adequate tones. The algorithm was evaluated as part of a melody extraction system during the MIREX audio melody extraction evaluation, where it gained very good results in the voicing detection and overall accuracy."

In short-term processing, a timbral distance between each pitch contour and the space of human voice is measured, so as to isolate any vocal pitch contour. Computation of the timbral distance is based on an acoustic-phonetic parametrization of human voiced sound. Long-term processing organizes short-term procedures in such a manner that relatively reliable melody segments are determined first. Tested on vocal excerpts from the ADC 2004 dataset, the proposed system achieves an overall transcription accuracy of 77%."

Here, we introduce a different aspect of evaluating the singing voice of an amateur singer: “enthusiasm”. First, we investigated whether human listeners can evaluate enthusiasm consistently and whether the listener’s perception matches the singer’s enthusiasm. We then identified three acoustic features relevant to the perception of enthusiasm: A-weighted power, “fall-down”, and vibrato extent. Finally, we developed a system for evaluating singing enthusiasm using these features, and obtained a correlation coefficient of 0.65 between the system output and human evaluation."

Narayanan+University of Southern California>USA>education","A music retrieval system that matches a short length music query with its variations in a database is proposed. In order to avoid the negative effects of different orchestration and performance style and tempo on transcription and matching, a mid-level representation schema and a tonal modeling approach is used. The mid-level representation approach transcribes the music pieces into a sequence of music tags corresponding to major and minor triad labels. From the transcribed sequence, n-gram models are built to statistically represent the harmonic progression. For retrieval, a perplexity based similarity score is calculated between each n-gram in the database and that for the query. The retrieval performance of the system is presented for a dataset of 2000 classical music pieces modeled using n-grams of sizes 2 through 6. We observe improvements in retrieval performance with increasing query length and n-gram order. The improvement converges to a little over one for all query lengths tested when n reaches 6."

However, the complexity of computing nearest neighbors grows linearly with size of the database, making exact retrieval impractical for large databases. We investigate modern variants of the classical KD-tree algorithm, which efficiently index high-dimensional data by recursive spatial partitioning. Experiments on the Million Song Dataset demonstrate that content-based similarity search can be significantly accelerated by the use of spatial partitioning structures."

From each chord progression, a directed labeled graph containing the interval transitions is extracted. This graph will be used as input for a graph comparison method based on simple cycles – cycles where the only repeated nodes are the first and the last one. In music, simple cycles represent the repetitive sub-structures of, e.g., modern pop/rock music. By means of a kernel function [10] whose feature space is spanned by these simple cycles, we obtain a kernel matrix (similarity matrix) which can then be used in music similarity retrieval tasks. The resulting algorithm has a time complexity of O(n+m(c+1)), where n is the number of vertices, m is the number of edges, and c is the number of simple cycles. The performance of our method is tested on both an idiom retrieval task, and a cover song retrieval task. Empirical results show the improved accuracy of our method in comparison with other string-matching, and graph-comparison methods used as baseline."

Since Western tonal harmony exhibits a considerable amount of structure and regularity, it lends itself to formalisation. In this paper we present HARMTRACE, a system that, given a sequence of symbolic chord labels, automatically derives the harmonic function of a chord in its tonal context. Among other applications, these functional annotations can be used to improve the estimation of harmonic similarity in a local alignment of two annotated chord sequences. We evaluate HARMTRACE and three other harmonic similarity measures on a corpus of 5,028 chord sequences that contains harmonically related pieces. The results show that HARMTRACE outperforms all three other similarity measures, and that information about the harmonic function of a chord improves the estimation of harmonic similarity between two chord sequences."

The way music is compared seems to vary among both individuals and cultures. Adapting a generic model to user ratings is useful for personalisation and can help to better understand such differences. This paper presents an approach to use machine learning techniques for analysing user data that specifies song similarity. We explore the potential for learning generalisable similarity measures with two state-of-the-art algorithms for learning metrics. We use the audio clips and user ratings in the MagnaTagATune dataset, enriched with genre annotations from the Magnatune label."

This reinterpretation aims to correct inconsistencies in the original distance space, like the hub phenomenon. Hubs are objects which appear unwontedly often as nearest neighbors in predominantly high-dimensional spaces. We apply Mutual Proximity to a widely used and standard content-based audio similarity algorithm. The algorithm is known to be negatively affected by the high number of hubs it produces. We show that without a modification of the audio similarity features or inclusion of additional knowledge about the datasets, applying Mutual Proximity leads to a significant increase of retrieval quality: (1) hubs decrease and (2) the k-nearest-neighbor classification rates increase significantly. The results of this paper show that taking the mutual neighborhood of objects into account is an important aspect which should be considered for this class of content-based audio similarity algorithms."

In this paper, we apply the bag-of-frames (BOF) approach to represent low-level acoustic features of a song and exploit music tags to help improve the performance of the audio-based music similarity computation. We first introduce a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as the encoding reference for BOF modeling, then we propose a novel learning algorithm to minimize the similarity gap between low-level acoustic features and music tags with respect to the prior weights of the pre-trained GMM. The results of audio-based query-by-example MIR experiments on the MajorMiner and Magnatagatune datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which gives a potential to guide MIR systems that employ BOF modeling."

The method is based on mapping the values of binary chromagrams extracted from MIDI files to tonal centroids, then quantizing the tonal centroid representation values to sequences, and finally measuring the similarity between the quantized sequences using Normalized Compression Distance (NCD). The method is comprehensively evaluated with a test set of classical music variations, and the highest achieved precision and recall values suggest that the proposed method can be applied for similarity measuring. Also, we analyze the performance of the method and discuss what should be taken into consideration when applying the method for measurement tasks."
13,Dmitry Bogdanov;Perfecto Herrera,How Much Metadata Do We Need in Music Recommendation?

Firstly, we propose a purely content-based approach, working on low-level (timbral, temporal, and tonal) and inferred high-level semantic descriptions of music. Secondly, we consider its simple refinement by adding a minimum amount of genre metadata. We compare the proposed approaches with one content-based and three metadata-based baselines. As such, we consider content-based approach working on inferred semantic descriptors, a tag-based recommender exploiting artist tags, a commercial black-box recommender partially employing collaborative filtering information, and a simple genre-based random recommender. We conduct a listening experiment with 19 participants. The obtained results reveal that although the low-level/semantic content-based approach does not achieve the performance of the baseline working exclusively on the inferred semantic descriptors, the proposed refinement provides significant improvement in the listeners’ satisfaction comparable with metadata-based approaches, and surpasses these approaches by the number of novel relevant recommendations. We conclude that the proposed content-based approach refined by simple genre metadata is suited for music discovery not only in the long-tail but also within popular music items."

We use “Forgetting Curve” to assess freshness of a song and evaluate “favoredness” using user log. We analyze user’s listening pattern to estimate the level of interest of the user in the next song. Also, we treat user behavior on the song being played as feedback to adjust the recommendation strategy for the next one. We develop an application to evaluate our approach in the real world. The user logs of trial volunteers show good performance of the proposed method."

One limitation of the current design of AMS is that evaluators are provided with scarce contextual information as to why they are evaluating the similarity of the songs and how this information will be used. This study explores the potential use of AMS results for generating playlists based on similarity. We asked participants to listen to a subset of results from the 2010 AMS task and evaluate the set of candidates generated by the algorithms as a playlist generated from a seed song (the query). We found that while similarity does affect how people feel about the candidate set as a playlist, other factors such as variety, metadata, personal preference, familiarity, mix of familiar and new music, etc. also strongly affect users' perceptions of playlist quality as well. We discuss six user behaviors in detail and the implications for the AMS evaluation task."

Bocko+University of Rochester>USA>education,"In this paper we propose a real-time signal processing framework for musical audio that 1) aligns the audio with an existing music score or creates a musical score by automated music transcription algorithms; and 2) obtains the expressive feature descriptors of music performance by comparing the score with the audio. Real-time audio segmentation algorithms are implemented to identify the onset points of music notes in the incoming audio stream. The score related features and musical expressive features are extracted based on these segmentation results. In a real-time setting, these audio segmentation and feature extraction operations have to be accomplished at (or shortly after) the note onset points, when an incomplete length of audio signal is captured. To satisfy real-time processing requirements while maintaining feature accuracy, our proposed framework combines the processing stages of prediction, estimation, and updating in both audio segmentation and feature extraction algorithms in an integrated refinement process. The proposed framework is implemented in a MATLAB real-time signal processing framework."

Although most of nowadays techniques are robust to the majority of them, the quasi-systematic use of a spectral representation makes them possibly sensitive to pitch-shifting. This distortion indeed induces a modification of the spectral content of the signal. In this paper, we propose a novel fingerprint technique, relying on a hashing technique coupled with a CQT-based fingerprint, with a strong robustness to pitch-shifting. Furthermore, we have associated this method with an efficient post-processing for the removal of false alarms. We also present the adaptation of a database pruning technique to our specific context. We have evaluated our approach on a real-life broadcast monitoring scenario. The analyzed data consisted of 120 hours of real radio broadcast (thus containing all the distortions that would be found in an industrial context). The reference database consisted of 30,000 songs. Our method, thanks to its increased robustness to pitch-shifting, shows an excellent detection score."

Furthermore, we show that combining longer fingerprints with re-ordering can lead to even higher performance gains, up to a factor of 9.8. The proposed re-ordering scheme is based on the observation that sub-prints, which are elements of n-runs of identical consecutive sub-prints, have a higher survival rate in distorted copies of a signal (e.g. after mp3 compression) than other sub-prints."

In this paper, we propose an extremely fast method of exploring a huge Hamming space for audio fingerprinting systems. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated by experiments using a database of 8,740 songs."

We then compare such histograms against the ones obtained for different music sources and against the theoretical values derived from 12-note just intonation and equal temperament. Our results evidence that the tunings in Carnatic and Hindustani music differ, the former tending to a just intonation system and the latter having much equal-tempered influences. Carnatic music also presents signs of a more continuous distribution of pitches. Further subdivisions of the octave are partially investigated, finding no strong evidence of them."

Unlike standard music notation, the interpretations of each sign are flexible and influenced by regional traditions, practices of given Jewish communities, larger musical influences beyond Jewish communities, and improvisatory elements incorporated by a given reader. In this paper we describe our collaborative work in developing and using computational tools to assess the stability of melodic formulas of cantillation signs based on two different performance traditions.

These representations cover more than the typical Western 12 pitch classes, since a fine-grained resolution of 1200 cents is used. Both scales with and without octave equivalence can be displayed graphically. The Tarsos API creates opportunities to analyse large sets of - ethnic - music automatically.

In particular, the supervised type of NMF is garnering much attention in source separation with respect to the analysis accuracy and speed. In this approach, a large number of spectral samples is used for analyzing a signal. If the system has a minimal number of samples, the accuracy deteriorates. Because such methods require all the possible samples for the analysis, it is hard to build a practical analysis system. To analyze signals properly even when short of samples, we propose a novel method that combines a supervised NMF and probabilistic search algorithms. In this approach, it is assumed that each instrumental category has a model-invariant feature called a probabilistic spectrum envelope (PSE). The algorithm starts with learning the PSEs of each category using a technique based on Gaussian Process Regression.

Velasco+Florida Atlantic University>USA>education;Edward W. Large+Florida Atlantic University>USA>education,"""Pulse and meter are remarkable in part because these perceived periodicities can arise from rhythmic stimuli that are not periodic. This phenomenon is most striking in syncopated rhythms, found in many genres of music, including music of non-Western cultures. In general, syncopated rhythms may have energy at frequencies that do not correspond to perceived pulse or meter, and perceived metrical frequencies that are weak or absent in the objective rhythmic stimulus. In this paper, we consider syncopated rhythms that contain little or no energy at the pulse frequency. We used 16 rhythms (3 simple, 13 syncopated) to test a model of pulse/meter perception based on nonlinear resonance, comparing the nonlinear resonance model with a linear analysis. Both models displayed the ability to differentiate between duple and triple meters, however, only the nonlinear model exhibited resonance at the pulse frequency for the most challenging syncopated rhythms. This result suggests that nonlinear resonance may provide a viable approach to pulse detection in syncopated rhythms."""

The tempo estimation systems follow a general scheme that consists of two main steps: the creation of a feature list and the detection of periodicities on this list. In this study, we propose a new method for the implementation of the first step, along with the addition of a final step that will enhance the tempo estimation procedure. The proposed method for the extraction of the feature list is based on Gammatone subspace analysis and Linear Prediction Error Filters (LPEFs). As a final step on the system, the application of a model that approximates the tempo perception by human listeners is proposed. The results of the evaluation indicate the proposed method compares favourably with other, state-of-the-art tempo estimation methods, using only one frame of the musical experts when most of the literature methods demand the processing of the whole piece."

The algorithm has two steps that iteratively - (a) calculate a function of the STFT and (b) build a transient signal. A dynamic thresholding scheme is used to locate the potential positions of transients in the signal. The iterative procedure ensures that genuine transients are built up while the localised spectral noise are suppressed by using an energy criterion. The extracted transient signal is later compared to a ground truth dataset. The algorithm performed well on two databases. On the EBU-SQAM database of monophonic sounds, the algorithm achieved an F-measure of 90% while on our database of polyphonic audio an F-measure of 91% was achieved. This technique is being used as a preprocessing step for a tempo analysis algorithm and a TSR (Transients + Sines + Residue) decomposition scheme."""

Evaluations were performed on multiple aspects, including calculating the average percentage of chords that were the same and those that were related, studying the manner in which the size of the training set affects the output harmonization, and examining a system’s behaviors in terms of the ability of generating unseen chords and the number of unique chords produced per song. We observed that the rule-based system performs comparably well while the result of the system with learning capability varies as the training set grows."

The HCS is harmonically modulated sinusoids with the amplitudes defined by a set of codewords. The considered algorithm performs melody extraction in two steps: i) pitch-candidate estimation and ii) pitch-sequence identification. In the estimation step, pitch candidates are estimated such that the HCS best represents the polyphonic audio in the MMSE sense. In the identification step, a melody line is selected from many possible pitch sequences based on the properties of melody line. Posterior to the melody line selection, a smoothing process is applied to refine spurious pitches and octave errors. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated and compared using the ADC04 and the MIREX05 dataset. The results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than or comparable to other algorithms submitted to MIREX2009."

In this paper, we consider the task of separating a monaural piano recording into two sound sources (or voices) that correspond to the left hand and the right hand. Since in this scenario the two sources share many physical properties, sound separation approaches identifying sources based on their spectral envelope are hardly applicable. Instead, we propose a score-informed approach, where explicit note events specified by the score are used to parameterize the spectrogram of a given piano recording. This parameterization then allows for constructing two spectrograms considering only the notes of the left hand and the right hand, respectively. Finally, inversion of the two spectrograms yields the separation result. First experiments show that our approach, which involves high-resolution music synchronization and parametric modeling techniques, yields good results for real-world non-synthetic piano recordings."

A new binary mask is created for the percussion signal which upon applying on the original signal improves harmonic versus percussion separation. We compare our algorithm with two recent techniques and show that on a database of polyphonic Indian music, the postprocessing algorithm improves the harmonic versus percussion decomposition significantly."

In this paper we develop a harpsichord-specific transcription system to analyse over 500 recordings of solo harpsichord music for which the temperament is specified on the CD sleeve notes. We compare the measured temperaments with the annotations and discuss the differences between temperament as a theoretical construct and as a practical issue for professional performers and tuners.

This study employed social network analysis to examine the characteristics of the ties through which late adolescents (15-17 years old) discover new music. In-depth interviews with 19 adolescents were conducted, which generated a sample of 334 ties. A statistical analysis of the ties showed that these adolescents relied mostly on strong ties to expand their music repertoire, that is, on people to which they felt very close and with whom they had frequent contacts. These ties were predominantly homophilous in terms of age, gender and musical taste. It was also found that parents were more likely than friends or other types of kins to be instrumental for music discovery. These findings suggest that a better knowledge of the characteristics of the ties through which people discover new music could provide useful insights for the design of recommender systems that include social networking features."

Observations of musicologists studying historical recordings of classical music were conducted at the British Library. The observations show that the musicologists alternate between a closed listening practice, relying exclusively on aural observations, and a multimodal listening practice, where they interact with various music representations and information sources using different media (e.g. metadata about the recordings and performers, sound visualisations, scores, lyrics and performance videos). The spoken parts of broadcast recordings brought historical/extra-musical clues helping to understand music performance practices.

For this setting, we introduce two new algorithms based on dynamic programming. Given a query point set, of size m, to be searched for in a database point set, of size n, and applying a search window of width w, our algorithms run in time O(mnw) for finding exact TTWI occurrences, and O(mnw2) for partial occurrences. Our new algorithms are computationally more efficient as their counterparts in the worst case scenario. More importantly, the elegance of our algorithms lies in their simplicity: they are much easier to implement and to understand than the rivalling sweepline-based algorithms. Our solution bears also theoretical interest. Dynamic programming has been used in very basic content-based retrieval problems, but generalizing them to more complex cases has proven to be challenging. In this special, seemingly more complex case, however, dynamic programming seems to be a viable option."

Once the rhythm is extracted, we use dynamic programming to compare several sequences. We report results of analysis on the size of rhythm patterns that are specific to a unique piece, as well as experiments on similarity queries (ragtime music and Bach chorale variations). These results show that long and intensity+ extractions are often good choices for rhythm extraction.

We have developed tools that use text analysis and alignment for the automatic retrieval, interpretation and analysis of such tabs in order to filter and estimate the most accurate tabs from the multitude available. We show that the standard means of ranking tabs, such as search engine ranks or user ratings, have little correlation with the accuracy of a tab and that a better ranking method is to use features such as the concurrency between tabs of the same song. We also compare the quality of top-ranked tabs with state-of-the-art chord transcription output and find that the latter provides a more reliable source of chord symbols with an accuracy rate 10% higher than the ranked hand annotations."

It is well known that each feature vector stemming from a union of independent linear subspaces admits a sparse representation with respect to a dictionary formed by all other feature vectors with nonzero coefficients associated only to feature vectors that stem from its own subspace. Such sparse representation reveals the relationships among the feature vectors and it is used to construct a similarity graph, the so-called ℓ1-graph.

Our approach does not require prior training on performances of the lead sheet to be aligned. We start by analyzing the problem and propose to represent the lead sheet as a MIDI file together with a structural information file. Then we propose a dynamic-programming-based system to align the chromagram representations of the audio performance and the MIDI score. Techniques are proposed to address the chromagram scaling, key transposition and structural change (e.g. a performer unexpectedly repeats a section) problems.

Existing audio-to-score alignment methods are sometimes vulnerable to the uncertainty in which multiple notes are simultaneously played with a variety of timbres because these methods rely on static observation models. For example, a chroma vector or a fixed harmonic structure template is used under the assumption that musical notes in a chord are all in the same volume and timbre. This paper presents a particle filter-based audio-to-score alignment method with a flexible observation model based on latent harmonic allocation. Our method adapts to the harmonic structure for the audio-to-score matching based on the observation of the audio signal through Bayesian inference.

We consider the problem of building models that express the ways in which deviations from a strict interpretations of the score occurs in the performance, and that cluster these deviations automatically. The clustering process is performed using expressive representations unambiguously notated on the musical score, without any arbitrariness by the human observer. The result of clustering is obtained as hierarchical tree structures for each deviational factor that occurred during the operation of the instrument. This structure represents an approximation of the performer’s interpretation with information notated on the score they used during the performance. This model represents the conditions that generate the difference in the fluctuation of performance expression and the amounts of deviational factors directly from the data of real performance. Through validations of applying the method to the data measured from real performances, we show that the use of information regarding expressive representation on the musical score enables the efficient estimation of generative-model for the musical performance."

A common means of obtaining accurately annotated data corpora is to start with a symbolic representation of a piece and generate corresponding audio data. This study investigates the effect of audio quality and source on the performance of two representative MIR algorithms – Onset Detection and Audio Alignment. Three kinds of audio material are compared: piano pieces generated using a freely available software synthesizer with its default instrument patches; a commercial high-quality sample library; and audio recordings made on a real (computer-controlled) grand piano. Also, the effect of varying richness of artistic changes in tempo and dynamics or natural asynchronies is examined. We show that the algorithms’ performance on the different datasets varies considerably, but synthesized audio does not necessarily yield better results."

MoodSwings has proven effective for data collection, but potential data effects caused by collaborative labeling have not yet been analyzed. In this work, we compare the effectiveness of MoodSwings to that of a more traditional data collection method, where annotation is performed by single, paid annotators. We implement a simplified labeling task to run on Amazon’s crowdsourcing engine, Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and analyze the labels collected with each method. A statistical comparison shows consistencies between MoodSwings and MTurk data, and we produce similar results using each as training data for automatic emotion production via supervised machine learning.

Robotic instruments that generate sound acoustically using actuators have been increasingly developed and used in performances and compositions over the past 10 years. Although such devices can be very sophisticated mechanically, in most cases they are passive devices that directly respond to control messages from a computer. In the few cases where more sophisticated control and feedback is employed it is in the form of simple mappings with little musical understanding. Several techniques for extracting musical information have been proposed in the field of music information retrieval. In most cases the focus has been the batch processing of large audio collections rather than real time performance understanding. In this paper we describe how such techniques can be adapted to deal with some of the practical problems we have experienced in our own work with music robotics. Of particular importance is the idea of self-awareness or proprioception in which the robot(s) adapt their behavior based on understanding the connection between their actions and sound generation through listening. More specifically we describe techniques for solving the following problems: 1) controller mapping 2) velocity calibration, and 3) gesture recognition."""

Secondly, we sought to find the relationship between audio and images within a defined feature space that correlated with the subjective similarity judgments. We trained two regression models using leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-audio-out cross-validation respectively, and exhaustively evaluated each model's ability to predict features of subject-ranked similar images using only a given audio clip's features. A retrieval task used the predicted image features to retrieve likely related images from the data set. The task was evaluated using the ground truth of subjects' actual similarity judgments.

To overcome the fundamental limitations in conventional models—that the model optimality is not guaranteed, that the value of n is fixed uniquely, and that a vocabulary of chord types (e.g., major, minor, · · · ) is defined in an arbitrary way—we propose a vocabulary-free infinity-gram model based on Bayesian nonparametrics. It accepts any combinations of notes as chord types and allows each chord appearing in a sequence to have an unbounded and variable-length context. All possibilities of n are taken into account when calculating the predictive probability of a next chord given a particular context, and when an unseen chord type emerges we can avoid out-of-vocabulary error by adaptively evaluating the 0-gram probability, i.e., the combinatorial probability of note components. Our experiments using Beatles songs showed that the predictive performance of the proposed model is better than that of the state-of-the-art models and that we could find stochastically-coherent chord patterns by sorting variable-length n-grams in a line according to their generative probabilities."

While a similar existing technique requires several hard decisions such as beat quantization and segmentation, our method uses a simple pragmatic approach based on recurrence plot to decide which repeated parts to include in the smoothing process. This approach uses a more formal definition of the repetition search and allows shorter (“chord-size”) repeated segments to contribute to the feature improvement process. In our experiments, our method outperforms conventional and popular smoothing techniques (a moving average filter and a median filter). In particular, it shows a synergistic effect when used with the Viterbi decoder."

It is infeasible to train the network on all available data in a supervised fashion, so we use unsupervised pretraining to be able to harness the entire dataset: we train a convolutional deep belief network on all data, and then use the learnt parameters to initialize a convolutional multilayer perceptron with the same architecture. The MLP is then trained on a labeled subset of the data for each task. We also train the same MLP with randomly initialized weights.

This avoids expensive iterative procedures usually required to infer sparse codes. We then use these sparse codes as inputs for a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM).

In this context, we have seen the growing of musical recommendation systems, which can improve the benefits for several applications, such as social networks and collective musical libraries. In this work, we have introduced a recent machine learning technique named Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) for musical genre classification, which has been demonstrated to be similar to the state-of-the-art pattern recognition techniques, but much faster for some applications. Experiments in two public datasets were conducted against Support Vector Machines and a Bayesian classifier to show the validity of our work. In addition, we have executed an experiment using very recent hybrid feature selection techniques based on OPF to speed up feature extraction process."""

Different approaches may capture different aspects of a song’s musical content, such as timbre, temporal dynamics, rhythmic qualities, etc. As a result, some auto-taggers may be better suited to model the acoustic characteristics commonly associated with one set of tags, while being less predictive for other tags. This paper proposes decision-fusion, a principled approach to combining the predictions of a diverse collection of content-based auto-taggers that focus on various aspects of the musical signal. By modeling the correlations between tag predictions of different auto-taggers, decision-fusion leverages the benefits of each of the original auto-taggers, and achieves superior annotation and retrieval performance."

We then learn the parameters of these logistic regression algorithms from the “bag-of-words” vectors and ground truth labels in the training set. At test time, the prediction confidence by the linear classifiers can be used to rank the songs for music annotation and retrieval tasks. Thanks to the convex property of the objective functions, we adopt an efficient and scalable generalized gradient method to learn the parameters, with global optimum guaranteed.

This leads to a higher-level, concise “Bag of Systems” (BoS) representation of the characteristics of a musical piece. Once songs are represented as a BoS histogram over codewords, traditional algorithms for text document retrieval can be leveraged for music auto-tagging. Compared to estimating a single generative model to directly capture the musical characteristics of songs associated with a tag, the BoS approach offers the flexibility to combine different classes of generative models at various time resolutions through the selection of the BoS codewords. Experiments show that this enriches the audio representation and leads to superior auto-tagging performance."

Participants were also asked to rate their familiarity of the theme tune and how much they liked the theme tune. A final question asked participants to identify the genre of the TV programme with which they associated the tune. The purpose of this is to aid in the affective classification of large-scale TV archives, such as those possessed by the BBC. We find correlations between evaluation and potency, potency and activity but none between activity and evaluation but no clear correlation between affect and genre.

It has long been a research topic of interest to discover the acoustic patterns in the music that carry that emotional information, and enable performers to communicate emotional messages to listeners. Previous works looked in the audio signal for local cues, most of which assume monophonic music, and their statistics over time. Here, we used generic audio features, that can be calculated for any audio signal, and focused on the progression of these features through time, investigating how informative the dynamics of the audio is for emotional content. Our data is comprised of piano and vocal improvisations of musically trained performers, instructed to convey 4 categorical emotions. We applied Dynamic Texture Mixture (DTM), that models both the instantaneous sound qualities and their dynamics, and demonstrated the strength of the model. We further showed that once taking the dynamics into account even highly reduced versions of the generic audio features carry a substantial amount of information about the emotional content. Finally, we demonstrate how interpreting the parameters of the trained models can yield interesting cognitive suggestions."

Psychophysiological responses of a user, particularly, the blood volume pulse, are taken while he listens to music. These signals are analyzed and mapped to various musical features of the songs he listened to. A motif discovery algorithm used in data mining is adapted to analyze signals of physiological data. Motif discovery finds patterns in the data that indicate points of interest in the music. The different motifs are stored in a library of patterns and used to identify other songs that have similar musical content. Results show that motifs selected have similar chord progressions. Some of which include frequently used chords in western pop music."

The results show that aperiodic changes in the auditory spectrum over time are the most salient contributor to the perception of urgency in sound.

Schmidt+Drexel University>USA>education;Youngmoo E. Kim+Drexel University>USA>education,"Human emotion responses to music are dynamic processes that evolve naturally over time in synchrony with the music. It is because of this dynamic nature that systems which seek to predict emotion in music must necessarily analyze such processes on short-time intervals, modeling not just the relationships between acoustic data and emotion parameters, but how those relationships evolve over time. In this work we seek to model such relationships using a conditional random field (CRF), a powerful graphical model which is trained to predict the conditional probability p(y|x) for a sequence of labels y given a sequence of features x. Treating our features as deterministic, we retain the rich local subtleties present in the data, which is especially applicable to content-based audio analysis, given the abundance of data in these problems. We train our graphical model on the emotional responses of individual annotators in an 11×11 quantized representation of the arousal-valence (A-V) space. Our model is fully connected, and can produce estimates of the conditional probability for each A-V bin, allowing us to easily model complex emotion-space distributions (e.g. multimodal) as an A-V heatmap."

Unfortunately, hand-annotating music with mood tags is usually an expensive, time-consuming and subjective process, to such an extent that automatic mood recognition methods are required. In this paper we present a new unsupervised learning approach for mood recognition, based on the lyrics and the audio of a song. Our system thus eliminates the need for ground truth mood annotations, even for training the system. We hypothesize that lyrics and audio are both partially determined by the mood, and that there are no other strong common effects affecting these aspects of music. Based on this assumption, mood can be detected by performing a multi-modal analysis, identifying what lyrics and audio have in common. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this using Canonical Correlation Analysis, and confirm our hypothesis in a subsequent analysis of the results."""

This paper provides new insights to this on-going argument by examining the relationship between lyrics creativity and music mood. We use three computational measures to gauge lyrics creativity: Type-to-Token Ratio, word norms fraction, and WordNet similarity. We then test three hypotheses regarding differences in lyrics creativity between music with different moods on 2715 U.S. rock songs. The three measures led to consistent findings that lyrics of negative and sad songs demonstrate higher linguistic creativity than those of positive and happy songs. Our findings support previous studies in psycholinguistics that people write more creatively when the text conveys sad or negative sentiment, and contradict previous research that positive mood triggers more unusual word associations. The result also indicates that different measures capture different aspects of lyrics creativity."

Beyond that, we illustrate via systematic experiments the importance of a number of issues relevant to autotagging, yet seldom reported in the literature. First, we show that the evaluation of autotagging techniques is fragile in the sense that small alterations to the set of tags to be learned, or in the set of music pieces may lead to dramatically different results. Hence we stress a set of methodological recommendations regarding data and evaluation metrics. Second, we conduct experiments on the generality of autotagging models, showing that a number of different methods at a similar performance level to the state-of-the-art fail to learn tag models able to generalize to datasets from different origins. Third we show that current performance level of a direct mapping between audio features and tags still appears insufficient to enable the possibility of exploiting natural tag correlations as a second stage to improve performance."
