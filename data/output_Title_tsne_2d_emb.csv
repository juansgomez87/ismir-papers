Beth Logan;Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients for Music Modeling.;2000;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416444;"We examine in some detail Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) the dominant features used for speech recognition and investigate their applicability to modeling music. In particular, we examine two of the main assumptions of the process of forming MFCCs: the use of the Mel frequency scale to model the spectra; and the use of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to decorrelate the Mel-spectral vectors. We examine the first assumption in the context of speech/music discrimination. Our results show that the use of the Mel scale for modeling music is at least not harmful for this problem, although further experimentation is needed to verify that this is the optimal scale in the general case. We investigate the second assumption by examining the basis vectors of the theoretically optimal transform to decorrelate music and speech spectral vectors. Our results demonstrate that the use of the DCT to decorrelate vectors is appropriate for both speech and music spectra.";Beth Logan, Cambridge Research Laboratory, USA, facility, Compaq Computer Corporation, USA, company;Compaq Computer Corporation;company;USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;27.057718;5.159131
Özgür Izmirli;Using a Spectral Flatness Based Feature for Audio Segmentation and Retrieval.;2000;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416438;A method that utilizes a spectral flatness based tonality feature for segmentation and content-based retrieval of audio is outlined. The method uses the tonality measure which is derived from the discrete bark spectrum as a means of detecting transitions between tonal and noise-like parts of the audio input. The meaning of ‘tonal’ in this context is different from the music-theoretical meaning and implies that there are dominant sinusoidal components in the spectrum, but, does not indicate that they are consonant or harmonic in any sense. Segmentation is performed by determining the times of these transitions, hence providing reference points for search purposes. Search is carried out by pivoting the query information on these reference points. The cumulative distance between the tonality pattern in successive frames of the query and the candidate sound fragments is used as a measure of similarity.;Ozgur Izmirli, Center for Arts and Technology, Connecticut College, USA, education;Connecticut College;education;USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;14.546061;20.11376
Jonathan Foote;ARTHUR: Retrieving Orchestral Music by Long-Term Structure.;2000;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416644;We introduce an audio retrieval-by-example system for orchestral music. Unlike many other approaches, this system is based on analysis of the audio waveform and does not rely on symbolic or MIDI representations. ARTHUR retrieves audio on the basis of long-term structure, specifically the variation of soft and louder passages. The long-term structure is determined from envelope of audio energy versus time in one or more frequency bands. Similarity between energy profiles is calculated using dynamic programming. Given an example audio document, other documents in a collection can be ranked by similarity of their energy profiles. Experiments are presented for a modest corpus that demonstrate excellent results in retrieving different performances of the same orchestral work, given an example performance or short excerpt as a query.;Jonathan Foote, FX Palo Alto Laboratory, Inc., USA, company;FX Palo Alto Laboratory;company;USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-21.627096;7.50615
"Dave Cliff;Heppie Freeburn";Exploration of Point-Distribution Models for Similarity-based Classification and Indexing of Polyphonic Music.;2000;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416572;"Similarity is an intuitive criterion for indexing and classification of digital audio files in music information retrieval systems. While significant work has been done on similarity-based approaches to monophonic music, methods for reliably dealing with databases of arbitrary polyphonic music remain elusive. In this paper we describe our ongoing research in exploring the use of high-order multivariate statistical techniques for similarity-based classification of polyphonic music in digital audio files. The statistical techniques we employ, known as point distribution models (PDMs), have recently proven to be of surprising value in computer vision research for rating visual similarity; here we are attempting to apply PDMs to musical similarity. This involves creating neural networks that approximate the statistical processing, to save on potentially explosive storage and processor requirements. This paper reports on work in progress: our results to date are inconclusive and somewhat negative. We describe our rationale for exploring PDMs in polyphonic music similarity-rating and discuss the problems we have encountered so far, with the intention of encouraging other members of the music information retrieval community to explore this and related approaches.";"Dave Cliff, Hewlett-Packard Labs, GBR, company;Heppie Freeburn, Hewlett-Packard Labs, GBR, company";Hewlett-Packard Labs, Hewlett-Packard Labs;company, company;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-9.894434;8.817378

Indiana University’s VARIATIONS system serves as both an early example of a working digital library supporting music content and an early application of World Wide Web technologies to music. Since April 1996, the system has provided online access within the William and Gayle Cook Music Library to sound recordings from the library’s collections.

The first perform monophonic transcription using an autocorrelation pitch tracker. The algorithm takes advantage of some heuristic parameters related to the similarity between image and sound in the collector. The detection is correct between notes B1 to E6 and further timbre analysis will provide the necessary parameters to reproduce a similar copy of the original sound. The second system is able to analyse simple polyphonic tracks. It is composed of a blackboard system, receiving its input from a segmentation routine in the form of an averaged STFT matrix. The blackboard contents an hypotheses database, an scheduler and knowledge sources, one of which is a neural network chord recogniser with the ability to reconfigure the operation of the system, allowing it to output more than one note hypothesis at the time.

Kim;Wei Chai;Ricardo García;Barry Vercoe";Analysis of a Contour-based Representation for Melody.;2000;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416760;Identifying a musical work from a melodic fragment is a task that most people are able to accomplish with relative ease. For some time now researchers have worked to give computers this ability as well, as it would be the cornerstone of any query-by-humming system. To accomplish this, it is reasonable to study how humans are able to perform this task, and to assess what features we use to determine melodic similarity. Research has shown that melodic contour is an important feature in determining melodic similarity, but it is also clear that rhythmic information is important as well. The goal of this research is to explore what variation of contour and rhythmic information can result in the most efficient, robust, and scalable representation for melody. We intend for this to be the basis of a query-by-humming system that will be used to test the validity of our proposed representation.;"Youngmoo E.

"Wei Chai;Barry Vercoe";Using User Models in Music Information Retrieval Systems.;2000;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415898;Most websites providing music services only support category-based browsing and/or text-based searching. There has been some research to improve the interface either for pull applications, e.g. query-by-humming systems, or for push applications, e.g. collaborative-filtering-based or featurebased music recommendation systems. However, for content-based search or feature-based filtering systems, one important problem is to describe music by its parameters or features, so that search engines or information filtering agents can use them to measure the similarity of the target (userÕs query or preference) and the candidates. MPEG7 (formally called ÒMultimedia Content Description InterfaceÓ) is an international standard, which describes the multimedia content data to allow universal indexing, retrieval, filtering, control, and other activities supported by rich metadata. However, the metadata about the multimedia content itself are still insufficient, because many features of multimedia content are quite perceptual and user-dependent. For example, emotional features are very important for multimedia retrieval, but they are hard to be described by a universal model since different users may have different emotional responses to the same multimedia content. We therefore turn to user modeling techniques and representations to describe the properties of each user, so that the retrieval will be more accurate. Besides, user modeling can be used to reduce the search space, make push service easier and improve the user interface.;"Wei Chai, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA, education;Barry Vercoe, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA, education";MIT,MIT;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-31.292583;15.094317
Arbee L. P. Chen;Music Representation, Indexing and Retrieval at NTHU.;2000;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417981;In this extended abstract, our work on the representation, indexing and retrieval of music data is summarized. We treat the rhythm, melody, and chords of a music object as music features and develop various data structures and algorithms to efficiently perform approximate and partial matching for the retrieval of music data [Liu99a], [Chen98], [Chou96]. In [Chen00a], we present the techniques for retrieving songs by music segments. A music segment consists of a segment type and the associated beat and pitch information. We also propose multi-feature index structures for exact and approximate searching on different features [Lee00]. The problem of feature extraction is also studied. The repeating pattern is defined as a sequence of notes, which appears more than once in music objects. Choosing repeating patterns as the feature to represent the music objects meets both efficiency and semantic-richness requirements for content-based music data retrieval. We propose approaches to efficiently discover the repeating patterns of music objects in [Hsu98], [Liu99b]. We have also implemented Muse, a prototype system for content-based music data retrieval to illustrate the feasibility of the concepts we propose.;Arbee L.P.

David Huron;Perceptual and Cognitive Applications in Music Information Retrieval.;2000;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1414794;"Music librarians and cataloguers have traditionally created indexes that allow users to access musical works using standard reference information, such as the name of the composer or the title of the work. While this basic information remains important, these standard reference tags have surprisingly limited applicability in most music-related queries. Music is used for an extraordinary variety of purposes: the restaurateur seeks music that targets a certain clientele; the aerobics instructor seeks a certain tempo; the ﬁlm director seeks music conveying a certain mood; an advertiser seeks a tune that is highly memorable; the physiotherapist seeks music that will motivate a patient; the truck driver seeks music that will keep him/her alert. Although there are many other uses for music, music’s preeminent functions are social and psychological. The most useful retrieval indexes are those that facilitate searching according to such social and psychological functions. Typically, such indexes will focus on stylistic, mood, and similarity information. In attempting to build such musical indexes, two general questions arise: (1) What is the best taxonomic system by which to classify moods, styles, and other musical characteristics? (2) How can we create automated systems that will reliably characterize recordings or scores? Internet-based music distribution has brought these two questions to the fore. In the case of proprietary musical databases, the second problem can be centrally managed, and perhaps addressed using manual methods. However, past experience with Internet access to text documents implies that non-proprietary decentralized indexing is likely to prove more popular and successful. That is, future music indexes will likely resemble web-wide search engines (like Infoseek or Google) rather than closed proprietary systems (like Beatscape or Encyclopedia Britannica). The problem of building musical web crawlers that traverse the web and index music-related ﬁles (such as MP3) should prove challenging. The enabling technology for such musical web crawlers will need to draw extensively on research in music perception and cognition. Consider two sample problems: music summarization and mood characterization.";David Huron, Ohio State University, USA, education;Ohio State University;education;USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-28.04015;17.259876
"Perry R. Cook;George Tzanetakis";Audio Information Retrieval (AIR) Tools.;2000;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416716;Most of the work in music Information Retrieval (MIR) and analysis has been performed using symbolic representation like MIDI. The recent advances in computing power and network connectivity have made large amounts of raw digital audio data available in the form of unstructured monolithic sound files. In this work the focus is on tools that work directly on real world audio data without attempting to transcribe the music. To distinguish from symbolic−based music IR for the remainder of the paper we use the term audio IR (AIR) to refer to techniques that work directly on raw audio signals. Obviously these signals can contain music as well as other types of audio like speech. We describe a series of tools based on current and newly developed techniques for AIR integrated under MARSYAS, our framework for audio analysis. For related work refer to (Foote, 1999). The tools developed are based on Signal Processing, Pattern Recognition and Visualization techniques. Finally, due to the immature state of the available techniques and to the inherent complexity of the task it is important to take advantage of the human user in the system. We have developed two user interfaces to integrate and improve our techniques: an augmented sound editor and TimbreGrams a novel graphical representation for soundfiles. The previously unpublished contributions of this paper are the genre classification method, the segmentation−based retrieval and summarization, and the definition of the TimbreGram.;"George Tzanetakis, Princeton University, USA, education; Perry Cook, Princeton University, USA, education";Princeton University, Princeton University;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-45.9091;-1.0803385

Michael Good;Representing Music Using XML.;2000;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415032;Why does the world need another music representation language? Beyond MIDI describes over 20 different languages or musical codes (Selfridge-Field, 1997). Most commercial music programs have their own internal, proprietary music representation and file format. Music's complexity has led to this proliferation of languages and formats. Sequencers, notation programs, analysis tools, and retrieval tools all need musical information optimized in different ways. Yet no music interchange language has been widely adopted since MIDI. MIDI has contributed to enormous growth in the electronic music industry, but has many well-known limitations for notation, analysis, and retrieval. These include its lack of representation of musical concepts such as rests and enharmonic pitches (distinguishing Db from C#), as well as notation concepts such as stem direction and beaming. Other interchange formats such as NIFF and SMDL overcome these restrictions, but have not been widely adopted. Successful interchange formats such as MIDI and HTML share a common trait that NIFF and SMDL lack. MIDI and HTML skillfully balance simplicity and power. They are simple enough for many people to learn, and powerful enough for many real-world applications. The simplicity makes it easy for software developers to implement the standards and to develop encoding tools for musicians. This helps circumvent the “chicken-and-egg” problem with new formats. XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation for representing structured data in text, designed for ease of usage over the Internet by a wide variety of applications. XML is a meta-markup language that lets designers and communities develop their own representation languages for different applications. Like HTML and MIDI, it balances simplicity and power in a way that has made it very attractive to software developers. The common base of XML technology lets developers of new languages focus on representation issues instead of low-level software development. All XML-based languages can be processed by a variety of XML tools available from multiple vendors. Since XML files are text files, users of XML files always have generic text-based tools available as a lowest common denominator. XML documents are represented in Unicode, providing support for international score exchange. MusicXML is an XML-based music interchange language. It represents common western musical notation from the 17th century onwards, including both classical and popular music. The language is designed to be extensible to future coverage of early music and less standard 20th and 21st century scores. Non-western musical notations would use a separate XML language. As an interchange language, it is designed to be sufficient, not optimal, for diverse musical applications. MusicXML is not intended to supersede other languages that are optimized for specific musical applications, but to support sharing of musical data between applications.;Michael Good, Recordare, USA, company;Recordare;company;USA;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-33.54167;-11.695323

In this paper we explore a broader range of n-gram techniques, and test them with both manual queries and queries automatically extracted from MIDI files. Our experiments show that alternative indeed, simpler n-gram matching techniques than those tested in earlier work can be as effective as local alignment; one highly effective technique is to simply count the number of 5-grams in common between query and stored piece of music.

Musicologists have applied various techniques to measure stylistic parameters of composers and general similarity of musical works. Music perception research has taught us that contour is the most important feature of melody for listeners (Dowling 1978).

Mary Levering;Intellectual Property Rights in Musical Works: Overview, Digital Library Issues and Related Initiatives.;2000;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416786;Our nation’s Founding Fathers incorporated copyright principles into the U.S. Constitution in order to foster the creation and dissemination of intellectual works for the public good.1 The federal copyright law supports these goals by permitting authors to reap rewards from their creative efforts for limited periods of time, while also benefitting subsequent creators by allowing them to use and build on prior works under certain circumstances. Thus, in order to stimulate originality and creativity, creators and owners of musical works are granted an exclusive bundle of rights in their copyrighted musical works for the enrichment of our society. Awareness of these rights is essential for all potential users, even for academics and scholars who wish to use these musical works for educational or other research purposes. Many musical works, especially those embodied in phonorecords, CD-ROMs and other audio-visual formats, have multiple layers of intellectual property rights involved.2 Scholars and institutions must respect these rights when digitizing, transmitting, retrieving or otherwise using copyrighted musical works in electronic formats. Even when underlying musical compositions are in the public domain, the version being used may include new copyrightable authorship that must be considered. Such authorship could include new arrangements, revised lyrics or music, other editorial revisions of the musical work itself, or—where the work is fixed as a series of sounds—it could include all or some new sounds, a remix of sounds, and so forth. Understanding concepts such as (1) the whole range of rightsholders’ exclusive rights in musical works,3 (2) the statutory limitations on these rights,4 including how the Fair Use 5 doctrine can be applied reasonably for educational and scholarly purposes, (3) when authorization is needed, (4) who the rightsholders are,6 and (5) how to secure required permissions efficiently and easily,7 have all become increasingly important;Mary Levering, U.S. Copyright Office, Library of Congress, USA, facility;U.S. Copyright Office Library of Congress;facility;USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-38.30771;13.760991

Schmitz";PROMS: A Web-based Tool for Searching in Polyphonic Music.;2000;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417139;One major task of a digital music library (DML) is to provide techniques to locate a queried musical pattern in all pieces of music in the database containing that pattern. For a survey of several computational tasks related to this kind of data retrieval we refer to Crawford et al. [3]. Existing DMLs like MELDEX [1], Themeﬁnder [4], and the Sonoda-Muraoka-System [7] work with melody databases relying on score-like information. Retrieval and matching are performed in a fault-tolerant way by string-based methods which mainly take into account pitch information. Generally, rhythm plays only a subordinate role. The music dictionary of Barlow and Morgenstern [2] shows that music retrieval based on pitch information only leads to results with typically too many false matches. (An example of such absurd matches is given in Selfridge-Field [6], p. 27.) We are convinced that both pitch and rhythm are crucial for recognizing melodies. In the more general context of polyphonic music, one is even forced to consider pitch and rhythm information. PROMS, a web-based computer-music service under development at the University of Bonn, Germany, is part of the MiDiLiB project [5]. The aim of PROMS is to design and to implement PROcedures for Music Search. Our discussion will take place in a rather general setting: we assume that our database contains several kinds of music such as polyphonic and homophonic music as well as melodies. We also use score-like information. A query to the database is a fragment of a piece of music. This could be a melody or a certain ﬁgure of an accompaniment. The task is now to locate eﬃciently all occurences of this fragment in all pieces of music in the database.;"M. Clausen, Universität Bonn, DEU, education;R.

"Eloi Batlle;Pedro Cano";Automatic Segmentation for Music Classification using Competitive Hidden Markov Models.;2000;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416764;Music information retrieval has become a major topic in the last few years and we can find a wide range of applications that use it. For this reason, audio databases start growing in size as more and more digital audio resources have become available. However, the usefulness of an audio database relies not only on its size but also on its organization and structure. Therefore, much effort must be spent in the labeling process whose complexity grows with database size and diversity. In this paper we introduce a new audio classification tool and we use its properties to develop an automatic system to segment audio material in a fully unsupervised way. The audio segments obtained with this process are automatically labeled in a way that two segments with similar psychoacoustics properties get the same label. By doing so, the audio signal is automatically segmented into a sequence of abstract acoustic events. This is specially useful to classify huge multimedia databases where a human driven segmentation is not practicable. This automatic classification allow a fast indexing and retrieval of audio fragments. This audio segmentation is done using competitive hidden Markov models as the main classification engine and, thus, no previous classified or hand-labeled data is needed. This powerful classification tool also has a great flexibility and offers the possibility to customize the matching criterion as well as the average segment length according to the application needs.;"Eloi Batlle, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Pedro Cano, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education;ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;4.105404;10.301048

Steve Larson;Searching for Meaning: Melodic Patterns, Combinations, and Embellishments.;2000;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415738;I am interested in the search for musical patterns -not so much because I want to find particular patterns, but because I want to understand musical meaning and I believe that musical meaning is something that listeners create when they relate musical patterns to one another, and when they relate musical patterns to other sorts of patterns. I describe a theory of musical meaning that argues that experienced listeners of tonal music hear musical motion metaphorically, as purposeful action within a dynamic field of musical forces (musical gravity, magnetism, and inertia). That theory has been used to clarify issues in Schenkerian theory, to analyze music in many styles, to improve the training of musicians, to account for experimental results in melodic expectation, to explain striking regularities in published analyses of tonal music, and even to illuminate the phenomenon of swing in jazz. The assumptions of that theory generate a small set of patterns and pattern combinations. This small set of patterns crops up over and over again in tonal music. Recognizing these patterns and their significance requires seeing how they are embellished in particular pieces. I illustrate these patterns, their combinations and embellishments, and something about their meaning by analyzing several folk songs, including Ah, vous dirai-je, Maman and Mozart's variations on it. The ubiquity of this small set of patterns raises interesting questions about searching for musical patterns, about the role of computers in information retrieval vs their role in musical artificial intelligence, and about musical meaning.

A method for indexing polyphonic music data files using the pitch and rhythm dimensions of music information is introduced. Our strategy is to use all combinations of monophonic musical sequences from polyphonic music data. ‘Musical words’ are then obtained using the n-gram approach enabling text retrieval methods to be used for polyphonic music retrieval. Here we extend the n-gram technique to encode rhythmic as well as interval information, using the ratios of onset time differences between two adjacent pairs of pitch events. In studying the precision in which intervals are to be represented, a mapping function is formulated in dividing intervals into smaller classes. To overcome the quantisation problems that arise with using rhythmic information from performance data, an encoding mechanism using ratio bins is also adopted.

Ludger Hofmann-Engl;Towards a Cognitive Model of Melodic Similarity.;2001;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417359;In recent years the interest in melodic similarity has mushroomed mainly due to the increased importance of music information retrieval (MIR). A great number of similarity models and algorithms have been developed, but little or no attention has been paid to cognitive or perceptual aspects to the issue at hand. Questions, about the relevant parameters and the appropriate implementation are under-researched as are experimental data. This paper focuses on the pitch aspect of melodic similarity, scrutinising the term pitch replacing it by a less ambivalent and overused term, which we will call meloton. Based on the term meloton the paper suggests to approach the issue of ‘melotonic’ similarity from a transformational angle, where transformations are executed as reflections and translations. ‘Melotonic’ similarity then is seen as related to the transformation process in form of a transpositional and interval vector. Finally, melotonic similarity as portrait in a psychological context emerges as a multi-facet phenomenon requiring the development of flexible models.;Ludger Hofmann-Engl, Keele University, UK, education;Keele University;education;GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-16.460705;-3.594479

Explicit linkage of relationships among entities is critical for document-based information retrieval. Works contain representations of recorded knowledge. Core bodies of work—canons—function to preserve and disseminate the parameters of a culture. A musical work is an intellectual sonic conception. Musical works take documentary form in a variety of instantiations. Epistemology for documentary analysis provides key perceptual information about the objects of knowledge organization. Works are carriers of knowledge, representing deliberately-constructed packages of both rational and empirical evidence of human knowledge. Smiraglia (2001) suggests the parameters of a theory of the work, incorporating the tools of epistemology to comprehend works by expressing theoretical parameters in the context of a taxonomic definition. A work is a signifying, concrete set of ideational conceptions that finds realization through semantic or symbolic expression. Semiotic analysis suggests a variety of cultural and social roles for works. Musical works, defined as entities for information retrieval, are seen to constitute sets of varying instantiations of abstract creations. Variability over time, demonstrated empirically, is an innate aspect of the set of all instantiations of a musical work, leading to complexity in the information retrieval domain.;Richard P.

Because of the lack of standards in music identification – or the lack of enforcement of existing standards – there is a huge amount of unidentified music files in the world. We propose here an identification mechanism that exploits the information possibly contained in the file name itself. We study large corpora of files whose names are decided by humans without particular constraints other than readability, and draw various hypotheses concerning the natural syntaxes that emerge from these corpora. A central hypothesis is the local syntactic consistency, which claims that file name syntaxes, whatever they are, are locally consistent within clusters of related music files. These heuristics allow to parse successfully file names without knowing their syntax a priori, using statistical measures on clusters of files, rather than on parsing files on a strict individual basis.

Since singing is naturally used as input, we aim to develop a front end dedicated to the symbolic translation of voice into a sequence of pitch and duration pairs. This operation is crucial for the effectiveness of searching for music by melodic similarity. In order to identify and segment a tune, well-known signal processing techniques are applied to the singing voice. After detecting pitch, a novel post-processing stage is proposed to adjust the intonation of the user. A global refinement is based on a relative scale estimated out of the most frequent errors made by singers. Four rules are then employed to eliminate local errors. This front end has been tested with five subjects and four short tunes, detecting some 90% of right notes. Results have been compared to other approximation methods like rounding to the nearest absolute tone/interval and an example of adaptive moving tuning, achieving respectively 74%, 80% and 44% of right estimations. A special session of tests has been conducted to verify the capability of the system in detecting vibrato/legato notes.

The features and performance of musical database systems critically depend on two factors: The nature and representation of the information stored in the database, and the search and retrieval mechanisms available to the user. In this paper, we present an experimental database and retrieval system for score-level musical information based on GUIDO Music Notation as the underlying music representation. We motivate and describe the database design as well as the flexible and efficient query and retrieval mechanism, a query-by-example technique based on probabilistic matching over a clustered dataset. This approach has numerous advantages, and based on experience with a first, experimental implementation, we believe it provides a solid foundation for powerful, efficient, and usable database and retrieval systems for structured musical information.;"Holger H.

The structure of the representation is discussed and illustrated with sample algorithms, including some from music information retrieval. The score representation was designed for the development of general algorithms and applications. The common container-iterator paradigm is used, in which the score is modelled as a container of objects, such as clefs, key signatures, time signatures, notes, rests and barlines. Access to objects within the score is achieved through iterators. These iterators provide the developer with a mechanism for accessing the information content of the score. The iterators are designed to achieve a high level of data hiding, so that the user is shielded from the substantial underlying complexity of score representation, while at the same time, having access to the score’s full information content.;"Donncha S.

This work aims to automate the task of music analysis. Music is “explained” in terms of embedded relationships, especially repetition of segments or phrases. The steps in this process are the transcription of audio into a representation with a similarity or distance metric, the search for similar segments, forming clusters of similar segments, and explaining music in terms of these clusters. Several transcription methods are considered: monophonic pitch estimation, chroma (spectral) representation, and polyphonic transcription followed by harmonic analysis. Also, several algorithms that search for similar segments are described. These techniques can be used to perform an analysis of musical structure, as illustrated by examples.;"Roger B.

An adequate separation of notes into different voices is crucial for obtaining readable and usable scores from performances of polyphonic music recorded on keyboard (or other polyphonic) instruments; for improving quantisation results within a transcription system; and in the context of music retrieval systems that primarily support monophonic queries. In this paper we propose a new voice separation algorithm based on a stochastic local search method. Different from many previous approaches, our algorithm allows chords in the individual voices; its behaviour is controlled by a small number of intuitive and musically motivated parameters; and it is fast enough to allow interactive optimisation of the result by adjusting the parameters in real-time. We demonstrate that compared to existing approaches, our new algorithm generates better solutions for a number of typical voice separation problems. We also show how by changing its parameters it is possible to create score output suitable for different needs, e.g., piano-style vs orchestral scores.";"J¨urgen Kilian, Darmstadt University of Technology, DEU, education;Holger H.

Basic mechanisms for inference of new patterns are described. The same pattern-matching algorithm used for pattern discovery during pre-analysis of musical works is reused during MIR applications.

The strategy employed here is to consider the audio signal as a succession of “states” (at various scales) corresponding to the structure (at various scales) of a piece of music. This is, of course, only applicable to certain kinds of musical genres based on some kind of repetition. From the audio signal, we ﬁrst derive dynamic features representing the time evolution of the energy content in various frequency bands. These features constitute our observations from which we derive a representation of the music in terms of “states”. Since human segmentation and grouping performs better upon subsequent hearings, this “natural” approach is followed here. The ﬁrst pass of the proposed algorithm uses segmentation in order to create “templates”. The second pass uses these templates in order to propose a structure of the music using unsupervised learning methods (K-means and hidden Markov model). The audio summary is ﬁnally constructed by choosing a representative example of each state.

The author presents the view that a digital library of Carnatic music should contain the objects of knowledge organization and their interrelationships as conceived by indigenous practitioners and audiences, rather than by Western specialists or North Indian practitioners. The author demonstrates how three features of Carnatic music (viz. aural transmission, improvisation and cultural context) have particular implications for the development of a digital library. Aural transmission results in musical documents being less important sources of information than recordings. Improvisation results in a highly transformational and often ambiguous relationship between (intra)musical signifiers and signified, causing problems of classification and machine recognition. The cultural context favours the prioritisation of emotional affect over introductory ease of listening and even technical recording quality in the selection of the recordings to be included in a digital library of Carnatic music.;Gordon Geekie, Manchester Metropolitan University, GBR, education;Manchester Metropolitan University;education;GBR;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;30.510506;23.303404
"Brian Whitman;Paris Smaragdis";Combining Musical and Cultural Features for Intelligent Style Detection.;2002;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417471;In this paper we present a musical style identification scheme based on simultaneous classification of auditory and textual data. Style identification is a task which often involves cultural aspects not present or eaxily extracted through auditory processing. The scheme we propose complements any audio driven genre or style detection system with a classifier based on web-extracted data we call 'community metadata.' The addition of these cultural attributes in our feature space aids in proper classification of acoustically dissimilar music within the same style, and similar music belonging to different styles.;"Brian Whitman, MIT Media Lab, USA, education;Paris Smaragdis, MIT Media Lab, USA, education";MIT, MIT;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;6.629708;31.450693
"Youngmoo E. Kim;Brian Whitman";Singer Identification in Popular Music using Warped Linear Prediction.;2002;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416954;In most popular music, the vocals sung by the lead singer are the focal point of the song. The unique qualities of a singer’s voice make it relatively easy for us to identify a song as belonging to that particular artist. With little training, if one is familiar with a particular singer’s voice one can usually recognize that voice in other pieces, even when hearing a song for the first time. The research presented in this paper attempts to automatically establish the identity of a singer using acoustic features extracted from songs in a database of popular music. As a first step, an untrained algorithm for automatically extracting vocal segments from within songs is presented. Once these vocal segments are identified, they are presented to a singer identification system that has been trained on data taken from other songs by the same artists in the database.;"Youngmoo E.

Each consists of originally-recorded music compact discs, standard MIDI ﬁles, and text ﬁles of lyrics. These DBs are now available in Japan at a cost equal to only duplication, shipping, and handling charges (virtually for free), and we plan to make them available outside Japan.

Papipuun performs quick listening in a manner similar to a stylus skipping on a scratched record, but the skipping occurs correctly at punctuations of musical phrases, not arbitrarily. First, we developed a method for representing polyphony based on time-span reduction in the generative theory of tonal music (GTTM) and the deductive object-oriented database (DOOD). The operation, least upper bound, plays an important role in similarity checking of polyphonies represented in our method. Next, in a preprocessing phase, a user analyzes a set piece by the time-span reduction, using a dedicated tool called TS-Editor. For the real-time phase, the user interacts with the main system, Summarizer, to perform music summarization. Summarizer discovers a piece structure by means of similarity checking. When the user identifies the fragments to be skipped, Summarizer deletes them and concatenates the rest. Papipuun can produce a music summarization of good quality, reflecting the atmosphere of an entire piece through interaction with the user.;"Keiji Hirata, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, JPN, facility;Shu Matsuda, Digital Art Creation, JPN, company";NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Digital Art Creation;company, company;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-20.458023;2.2525356
Steffen Pauws;"CubyHum: a fully operational ""query by humming"" system.";2002;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415614;'Query by humming' is an interaction concept in which the identity of a song has to be revealed fast and orderly from a given sung input using a large database of known melodies. In short, it tries to detect the pitches in a sung melody and compares these pitches with symbolic representations of the known melodies. Melodies that are similar to the sung pitches are retrieved. Approximate pattern matching in the melody comparison process compensates for the errors in the sung melody by using classical dynamic programming. A filtering method is used to save computation in the dynamic programming framework. This paper presents the algorithms for pitch detection, note onset detection, quantization, melody encoding and approximate pattern matching as they have been implemented in the CubyHum software system. Since human reproduction of melodies is imperfect, findings from an experimental singing study were a crucial input to the development of the algorithms. Future research should pay special attention to the reliable detection of note onsets in any preferred singing style. In addition, research on index methods and fast bit-parallelism algorithms for approximate pattern matching need to be further pursued to decrease computational requirements when dealing with large melody databases.;Steffen Pauws, Philips Research Eindhoven, NLD, company;philips Research;company;NLD;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-48.858047;-22.037762
"Steffen Pauws;Berry Eggen";PATS: Realization and user evaluation of an automatic playlist generator.;2002;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417971;A means to ease selecting preferred music referred to as Personalized Automatic Track Selection (PATS) has been developed. PATS generates playlists that suit a particular context-of-use, that is, the real-world environment in which the music is heard. To create playlists, it uses a dynamic clustering method in which songs are grouped based on their attribute similarity. The similarity measure selectively weighs attribute-values, as not all attribute-values are equally important in a context-of-use. An inductive learning algorithm is used to reveal the most important attribute-values for a context-of-use from preference feedback of the user. In a controlled user experiment, the quality of PATS-compiled and randomly assembled playlists for jazz music was assessed in two contexts-of-use. The quality of the randomly assembled playlists was used as base-line. The two contexts-of-use were ‘listening to soft music’ and ‘listening to lively music’. Playlist quality was measured by precision (songs that suit the context-of-use), coverage (songs that suit the context-of-use but that were not already contained in previous playlists) and a rating score. Results showed that PATS playlists contained increasingly more preferred music (increasingly higher precision), covered more preferred music in the collection (higher coverage), and were rated higher than randomly assembled playlists.;"Steffen Pauws, Philips Research Eindhoven, NLD, company;Berry Eggen, Philips Research Eindhoven, NLD, company, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, NLD, education";Philips Research, Philips Research;company, company;NLD, NLD;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-56.676582;27.005901

You’re in your car, listening to the radio and suddenly you hear a song that catches your attention. It’s the best new song you have heard for a long time, but you missed the announcement and don’t recognize the artist. Still, you would like to know more about this music. What should you do? You could call the radio station, but that’s too cumbersome. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could push a few buttons on your mobile phone and a few seconds later the phone would respond with the name of the artist and the title of the music you’re listening to? Perhaps even sending an email to your default email address with some supplemental information. In this paper we present an audio fingerprinting system, which makes the above scenario possible. By using the fingerprint of an unknown audio clip as a query on a fingerprint database, which contains the fingerprints of a large library of songs, the audio clip can be identified. At the core of the presented system are a highly robust fingerprint extraction method and a very efficient fingerprint search strategy, which enables searching a large fingerprint database with only limited computing resources.;"Jaap Haitsma, Philips Research, NLD, company;Ton Kalker, Philips Research, NLD, company";Philips Research, Philips Research;company, company;NLD, NLD;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;22.590425;31.466022

Symbolic representations such as MIDI allow the easy calculation of such information and its manipulation. In contrast, most of the existing work in Audio MIR uses timbral and beat information, which can be calculated using automatic computer audition techniques. In this paper, Pitch Histograms are defined and proposed as a way to represent the pitch content of music signals both in symbolic and audio form. This representation is evaluated in the context of automatic musical genre classification. A multiple-pitch detection algorithm for polyphonic signals is used to calculate Pitch Histograms for audio signals. In order to evaluate the extent and significance of errors resulting from the automatic multiple-pitch detection, automatic musical genre classification results from symbolic and audio data are compared. The comparison indicates that Pitch Histograms provide valuable information for musical genre classification. The results obtained for both symbolic and audio cases indicate that although pitch errors degrade classification performance for the audio case, Pitch Histograms can be effectively used for classification in both cases.;"George Tzanetakis, Princeton University, USA, education;Andrey Ermolinskyi, Princeton University, USA, education;Perry Cook, Princeton University, USA, education";Princeton University, Princeton University, Princeton University;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-7.283643;-7.515276

All the words used by all subjects in both tasks were classified into 7 categories. The two most frequently appearing categories were emotions and occasions or filmed events regardless of the task type. These subjects, none of whom had formal training in music, almost never used words related to formal features of music, rather using words indicating other features, most of which have not been considered in existing or proposed music IR systems. These results suggest that music IR research should be extended to consider needs other than finding known items, or items identified by formal characteristics, and that understanding music information needs of users should be prioritized to design more sophisticated music IR systems.;"Ja-Young Kim, Rutgers University, USA, education;Nicholas J.

The patterns are represented as acoustic signals, and are not assumed to have been performed with similar sound sets. Two novel methods are presented that constitute the algorithmic core of the system. First, a probabilistic musical meter estimation process is described, which segments a continuous musical signal into patterns. As a side-product, the method outputs tatum, tactus (beat), and measure lengths. A subsequent process performs the actual similarity measurements. Acoustic features are extracted which model the ﬂuctuation of loudness and brightness within the pattern, and dynamic time warping is then applied to align the patterns to be compared. In simulations, the system behaved consistently by assigning high similarity measures to similar musical rhythms, even when performed using different sound sets.;"Jouni Paulus, Tampere University of Technology, FIN, education;Anssi Klapuri, Tampere University of Technology, FIN, education";Tampere University of Technology, Tampere University of Technology;education, education;FIN, FIN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;40.60127;21.361616

Anna Pienimäki;Indexing Music Databases Using Automatic Extraction of Frequent Phrases.;2002;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416632;The Music Information Retrieval methods can be classiﬁed into online and ofﬂine methods. The main drawback in most of the ofﬂine algorithms is the space the indexing structure requires. The amount of data stored into the structure can however be reduced by storing only the suitable index terms or phrases instead of the whole contents of the database. Repetition is agreed to be one of the most important factors of musical meaningfulness. Therefore repetitive musical phrases are suitable for indexing purposes. The extraction of such phrases can be done by applying an existing text mining method to musical data. Because of the differences between text and musical data the application requires some technical modiﬁcation of the method. This paper introduces a text mining-based music database indexing method that extracts maximal frequent phrases from musical data and sorts them by their length, frequency and personality. The implementation of the method found three different types of phrases from the test corpusconsistingof Irish folk music tunes.

To our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to use polyphonic audio queries to retrieve from polyphonic symbolic collections. Furthermore, as our results will show, we will not only use an audio query to retrieve a known-item symbolic piece, but we will use it to retrieve an entire set of real-world composed variations on that piece, also in the symbolic format. The harmonic modeling approach which forms the basis of this work is a new and valuable technique which has both wide applicability and future potential.;"Jeremy Pickens, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA, education;Juan Pablo Bello, Queen Mary, University of London, GBR, education;Giuliano Monti, Queen Mary, University of London, GBR, education;Tim Crawford, King’s College, London, GBR, education;Matthew Dovey, Oxford University, GBR, education;Mark Sandler, Queen Mary, University of London, GBR, education;Don Byrd, Indiana University, Bloomington, USA, education";University of Massachusetts Amherst, Queen Mary University of London, Queen Mary University of London, King’s College London, Oxford University, Queen Mary University of London, Indiana University Bloomington;education, education, education, education, education, education, education;USA, GBR, GBR, GBR, GBR, GBR, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;14.8228855;4.6010866
"Hui Jin;H. V. Jagadish";Indexing Hidden Markov Models for Music Retrieval.;2002;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1418259;Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been suggested as an effective technique to represent music. Given a collection of musical pieces, each represented by its HMM, and a query, the retrieval task reduces to finding HMM most likely to have generated the query. The musical piece represented by this HMM is frequently the one rendered by the user, possibly imperfectly. This method might be inefficient if there is a very large music database, since each HMM to be tested requires the evaluation of a dynamic programming algorithm. In this paper, we propose an indexing mechanism that can aggressively prune the set of candidate HMMs to be evaluated in response to a query. Our experiments on a music database showed an average of a seven-fold speed up with no false dismissals.;"Hui Jin, The University of Michigan, USA, education;H. V.

We argue that segmentation based on melodic features is more effective than random or N-grams-based segmentation, which ignore any context. We have carried out an experiment employing experienced subjects. The manual segmentation result has been processed to detect the most probable boundaries in the melodic surface, using a probabilistic decision function. The detected boundaries have then been compared with the boundaries detected by an automatic procedure implementing an algorithm for melody segmentation, as well as by a random segmenter and by a N-gram-based segmenter.

John R. McPherson;Introducing Feedback into an Optical Music Recogniition System.;2002;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417725;Optical Music Recognition is the process of converting a graphical representation of music (such as sheet music) into a symbolic format (for example, a format that is understood by music software). Music notation is rich in structural information, and the relative positions of objects can often help to identify them. When objects are unidentiﬁed or mis-identiﬁed, many current systems “coerce” the set of objects into some semantic representation, for example by modifying the detected durations. This could cause correctly identiﬁed symbols to be modiﬁed. The knowledge that the current set of identiﬁed symbols cannot be semantically parsed could instead be used to re-examine some of the symbols before deciding whether or not the classiﬁcation is correct. This paper describes work in progress involving the use of feedback between the various phases of the optical music recognition process to automatically correct mistakes, such as symbolic classiﬁcation errors or mis-detected staff systems.;John R.

We compare two methods of extracting periodicities from audio recordings in order to ﬁnd the metrical hierarchy and timing patterns by which the style of the music can be recognised: the ﬁrst method performs onset detection and clustering of inter-onset intervals; the second uses autocorrelation on the amplitude envelopes of band-limited versions of the signal as its method of periodicity detection. The relationships between periodicities are then used to ﬁnd the metrical hierarchy and to estimate the tempo at the beat and measure levels of the hierarchy. The periodicities are then interpreted as musical note values, and the estimated tempo, meter and the distribution of periodicities are used to predict the style of music using a simple set of rules.

Searching for music is performed by specifying keywords and naive string matching techniques. In the past years the emerging research area of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) has produced a variety of new ways of looking at the problem of music search. Such MIR techniques can signiﬁcantly enhance the ways user search for music over P2P networks. In order for that to happen there are two main challenges that need to be addressed: 1) scalability to large collections and number of peers, 2) richer set of search semantics that can support MIR especially when retrieval is content-based. In this paper, we describe a scalable P2P system that uses Rendezvous Points (RPs) for music metadata registration and query resolution, that supports attributevalue search semantics as well as content-based retrieval.

We have created a database and a software testbed for the systematic evaluation of various query-by-humming (QBH) search systems. As might be expected, different queries and different databases lead to wide variations in observed search precision. “Natural” queries from two sources led to lower performance than that typically reported in the QBH literature. These results point out the importance of careful measurement and objective comparisons to study retrieval algorithms. This study compares search algorithms based on note-interval matching with dynamic programming, fixed-frame melodic contour matching with dynamic time warping, and a hidden Markov model.

Chord sequences are a description that captures much of the character of a piece in a compact form and using a modest lexicon. Chords also have the attractive property that a piece of music can (mostly) be segmented into time intervals that consist of a single chord, much as recorded speech can (mostly) be segmented into time intervals that correspond to specific words. In this work, we build a system for automatic chord transcription using speech recognition tools. For features we use “pitch class profile” vectors to emphasize the tonal content of the signal, and we show that these features far outperform cepstral coefficients for our task. Sequence recognition is accomplished with hidden Markov models (HMMs) directly analogous to subword models in a speech recognizer, and trained by the same Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Crucially, this allows us to use as input only the chord sequences for our training examples, without requiring the precise timings of the chord changes — which are determined automatically during training. Our results on a small set of 20 early Beatles songs show frame-level accuracy of around 75% on a forced-alignment task.;"Alexander Sheh, Columbia University, USA, education;Daniel P.W.

But without a large corpus of real-world music transcribed at the note level, these algorithms are unable to take advantage of supervised learning methods and also have difﬁculty reporting a quantitative metric of their performance, such as a Note Error Rate. We attempt to remedy this situation by taking advantage of publicly-available MIDI transcriptions. By force-aligning synthesized audio generated from a MIDI transcription with the raw audio of the song it represents we can correlate note events within the MIDI data with the precise time in the raw audio where that note is likely to be expressed. Having these alignments will support the creation of a polyphonic transcription system based on labeled segments of produced music. But because the MIDI transcriptions we ﬁnd are of variable quality, an integral step in the process is automatically evaluating the integrity of the alignment before using the transcription as part of any training set of labeled examples. Comparing a library of 40 published songs to freely available MIDI ﬁles, we were able to align 31 (78%). We are building a collection of over 500 MIDI tran-scriptions matching songs in our commercial music collection, for a potential total of 35 hours of note-level transcriptions, or some 1.5 million note events.;"Robert J.

In this paper, we examine both acoustic and subjective approaches for calculating similarity between artists, comparing their performance on a common database of 400 popular artists. Specifically, we evaluate acoustic techniques based on Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and an intermediate ‘anchor space’ of genre classification, and subjective techniques which use data from The All Music Guide, from a survey, from playlists and personal collections, and from web-text mining. We find the following: (1) Acoustic-based measures can achieve agreement with ground truth data that is at least comparable to the internal agreement between different subjective sources. However, we observe significant differences between superficially similar distribution modeling and comparison techniques. (2) Subjective measures from diverse sources show reasonable agreement, with the measure derived from co-occurrence in personal music collections being the most reliable overall. (3) Our methodology for large-scale cross-site music similarity evaluations is practical and convenient, yielding directly comparable numbers for different approaches.

Olivier Lartillot;Discovering musical pattern through perceptual heuristics.;2003;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417285;This paper defends the view that the intricate difficulties challenging the emerging domain of Musical Pattern Discovery, which is dedicated to the automation of motivic analysis, will be overcome only through a thorough taking into account of the specificity of music as a perceptive object. Actual musical patterns, although constantly transformed, are nevertheless perceived by the listener as musical identities. Such dynamical properties of human perception, not reducible to geometrical models, will only be explained with the notions of contexts and expectations. This paper sketches the general principles of a new approach that attempts to build such a general perceptual system. On a sub-cognitive level, patterns are discovered through the detection, by an associative memory, of local similarities. On a cognitive level, patterns are managed by a general logical framework that avoids irrelevant inferences and combinatorial explosion. In this way, actual musical patterns that convey musical significance are discovered. This approach, offering promising results, is a first step toward a complete system of automated music analysis and an explicit modeling of basic mechanisms for music understanding.;Olivier Lartillot, IRCAM - Centre Pompidou, FRA, facility;IRCAM;facility;FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-3.5274618;-16.584742

Since a single feature only captures some selective characteristics of an audio signal, this information may, in some cases, not be sufﬁcient to properly identify similarities between songs. This paper presents a system which combines a set of acoustic features for the task of retrieving similar sounding songs.

All the parts of a recording can be thus indexed according to score information. The automatic alignment presented in this paper is based on a dynamic time warping method. Local distances are computed using the signal’s spectral features through an attack plus sustain note modeling. The method is applied to mixtures of harmonic sustained instruments, excluding percussion for the moment. Good alignment has been obtained for polyphony of up to five instruments. The method is robust for difficulties such as trills, vibratos and fast sequences. It provides an accurate indicator giving position of score interpretation errors and extra or forgotten notes. Implementation optimizations allow aligning long sound files in a relatively short time.

Steffen Pauws;Effects of song familiarity, singing training and recent song exposure on the singing of melodies.;2003;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1414722;Findings of a singing experiment are presented in which trained and untrained singers sang melodies of familiar and less familiar Beatles songs from memory and after listening to the original song on CD. Results showed that adopting the correct pitch of a melody was done better by trained singers, and only after listening to the song. Contours of melodies were equally well reproduced by both trained and untrained singers. In contrast, the intervals of a melody were sung more accurately by trained singers than by untrained singers. These findings demonstrate the dominance of contour for remembering melodies and the poorer interval encoding of melodies or the lack of essential singing skills by untrained singers. When singing from memory, almost two-third of the singing came reasonably close to the actual tempo on the CD. This improved to more than 70% after listening to the song on CD. In general, the singing of less familiar melodies improved after song listening.

The results indicate that the task is beyond those who are unmusical, and that a scale numeric representation is easier than a contour one for those of moderate musical skill.

In this paper, we present an automatic music transcription system dedicated to Tabla a North Indian percussion instrument. Our approach is based on three main steps: ﬁrstly, the audio signal is segmented in adjacent segments where each segment represents a single stroke. Secondly, rhythmic information such as relative durations are calculated using beat detection techniques. Finally, the transcription (recognition of the strokes) is performed by means of a statistical model based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The structure of this model is designed in order to represent the time dependencies between successives strokes and to take into account the speciﬁcities of the tabla score notation (transcription symbols may be context dependent).

Although this type of description is of great interest, it is very difficult to implement it into realistic automatic labelling systems because of the necessity of dealing with thousands of categories, hence with thousands of different sound models. Moreover, digitally synthesised or transformed sounds, which are frequently used in most of the contemporary popular music, have no identifiable sources. We propose a description framework, based on Schaeffer’s research on a generalised solfeggio which could be applied to any type of sounds.

The approach has been evaluated on clean and noisy monophonic recordings, and on combinations of two instrument sounds. These included random chords made from two isolated notes and combinations of two realistic phrases taken from commercially available compact discs.

We view notes as weighted points in a two-dimensional space, with the coordinates of the points reflecting the pitch and onset time of notes and the weights of points depending on the corresponding notes’ duration and importance. This enables us to measure similarity by using the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) and the Proportional Transportation Distance (PTD), a pseudo-metric for weighted point sets which is based on the EMD. A comparison of our experiment results with earlier work shows that by using weighted point sets and the EMD/PTD instead of Howard’s method (1998) using the DARMS encoding for determining melodic similarity, it is possible to group together about twice as many known occurrences of a melody within the RISM A/II collection. Also, the percentage of successfully identified authors of anonymous incipits can almost be doubled by comparing weighted point sets instead of looking for identical representations in Plaine & Easie encoding as Schlichte did in 1990.;"Rainer Typke, University of Utrecht, NLD, education;Panos Giannopoulos, University of Utrecht, NLD, education;Remco C.

"Wei-Ho Tsai;Hsin-Min Wang";Towards Automatic Identification Of Singing Language In Popular Music Recordings.;2004;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417511;The automatic analysis of singing from music is an important and challenging issue within the research target of content-based retrieval of music information. As part of this research target, this study presents a first attempt to automatically identify the language sung in a music recording. It is assumed that each language has its own set of constraints that specify which of the basic linguistic events present in a singing process are allowed to follow another. The acoustic structure of individual languages may, thus, be characterized by statistically modeling those constraints. To this end, the proposed method employs vector clustering to convert a singing signal from its spectrum-based feature representation into a sequence of smaller basic phonological units. The dynamic characteristics of the sequence are then analyzed by using bigram language models. Since the vector clustering is performed in an unsupervised manner, the resulting system does not use sophisticated linguistic knowledge and, thus, is easily portable to new language sets. In addition, to eliminate the interference of background music, we leverage the statistical estimation of a piece’s music background so that the vector clustering is relevant to the solo singing voices in the accompanied signals.;"Wei-Ho Tsai, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, TWN, facility;Hsin-Min Wang, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, TWN, facility";Academia Sinica, Academia Sinica;facility, facility;TWN, TWN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;29.445097;-2.2726197

Low level audio features are ideal for calculating identity, but are of limited use for similarity measures, as many aspects of music can only be captured by considering high level features. We present a new method of characterising music by typical bar-length rhythmic patterns which are automatically extracted from the audio signal, and demonstrate the usefulness of this representation by its application in a genre classiﬁcation task. Recent work has shown the importance of tempo and periodicity features for genre recognition, and we extend this research by employing the extracted temporal patterns as features. Standard classiﬁcation algorithms are utilised to discriminate 8 classes of Standard and Latin ballroom dance music (698 pieces). Although pattern extraction is error-prone, and patterns are not always unique to a genre, classiﬁcation by rhythmic pattern alone achieves up to 50% correctness (baseline 16%), and by combining with other features, a classiﬁcation rate of 96% is obtained.;"Simon Dixon, Austrian Research Institute for AI, AUT, facility;Fabien Gouyon, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Gerhard Widmer, Medical University of Vienna, AUT, education";Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Medical University of Vienna;facility, education, education;AUT, ESP, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;38.419083;19.249989

"Ryan Scherle;Donald Byrd";The Anatomy of a Bibliographic Search System for Music.;2004;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417789;Traditional library catalog systems have been effective in providing access to collections of books, ﬁlms, and other material. However, they have many limitations when it comes to ﬁnding musical information, which has signiﬁcantly different, and in many ways more complex, structure. The Variations2 search system is an alternative designed speciﬁcally to aid users in searching for music. It leverages a rich set of bibliographic data records, expressing relationships between creators of music and their creations. These records enable musicians to search for music using familiar terms and relationships, rather than trying to decipher the methods libraries typically use to organize musical items. This paper describes the design and implementation of the system that makes these searches possible.;"Ryan Scherle, Indiana University, USA, education;Donald Byrd, Indiana University, USA, education";Indiana University Bloomington, Indiana University Bloomington;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-35.334015;15.215577
Richard Terrat;Pregroup Grammars for Chords.;2004;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416702;Pregroups had been conceived as an algebraic tool to recognize grammatically well-formed sentences in natural languages [3]. Here we wish to use pregroups to recognize well-formed chords of pitches, for a given definition of those chords. We show how a judicious choice of basic and simple types allows a context-free grammatical description. Then we use the robustness property to extend the set of well-formed chords in a simple way. Finally we argue in favor of an utilization of pregroups grammars for the recognition and classification of chord sequences.;Richard G.

We represent short-term log-power spectra of possibly polyphonic music as weighted non-linear combinations of typical note spectra plus background noise. These typical note spectra are learnt either on databases containing isolated notes or on solo recordings from different instruments. We show that this model has some theoretical advantages over methods based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) or on linear ISA. Preliminary experiments with five instruments and test excerpts taken from commercial CDs give promising results. The performance on clean solo excerpts is comparable with existing methods and shows limited degradation under reverberant conditions. Applied to a difficult duo excerpt, the model is also able to identify the right pair of instruments and to provide an approximate transcription of the notes played by each instrument.;"Emmanuel Vincent, IRCAM, Analysis-Synthesis Group, FRA, facility;Xavier Rodet, IRCAM, Analysis-Synthesis Group, FRA, facility";IRCAM,IRCAM;facility, facility;FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;30.405405;-26.27472

Our experiments show that creating a database of reference files with reliable human-annotated onset times is a complex task, since its subjective part cannot be neglected. This work provides a methodology to construct such a database. With the use of a carefully designed software tool, called SOL (Sound Onset Labellizer), we can obtain a set of reference onset times that are cross-validated amongst different expert listeners. We show that the mean error of annotated times across test subjects is very much signal-dependent. This value can be used, when evaluating automatic labelling, as an indication of the relevant tolerance window. The SOL annotation software is to be released freely for research purposes. Our test library, 17 short sequences containing about 750 onsets, comes from copyright-free music or from the public RWC database. The corresponding validated onset labels are also freely distributed, and are intended to form the starting point for the definition of a reliable benchmark.;"Pierre LEVEAU, Laboratoire d’Acoustique Musicale, FRA, facility;Laurent DAUDET, Laboratoire d’Acoustique Musicale, FRA, facility;Ga¨el RICHARD, GET - ENST (T´el´ecom Paris), FRA, education";IRCAM,IRCAM, Telecom ParisTech;facility, facility, education;FRA, FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;44.365547;4.6259885

The automatic recognition of musical chords is necessary for music information retrieval (MIR) systems, since the chord sequences of musical pieces capture the characteristics of their accompaniments. None of the previous methods can accurately recognize musical chords from complex audio signals that contain vocal and drum sounds. The main problem is that the chord-boundary-detection and chord-symbol-identification processes are inseparable because of their mutual dependency. In order to solve this mutual dependency problem, our method generates hypotheses about tuples of chord symbols and chord boundaries, and outputs the most plausible one as the recognition result. The certainty of a hypothesis is evaluated based on three cues: acoustic features, chord progression patterns, and bass sounds.

Our system can represent onset times and names of drums by means of drum descriptors deﬁned in the context of MPEG-7. For their automatic description, drum sounds must be identiﬁed in such polyphonic signals. The problem is that acoustic features of drum sounds vary with each musical piece and precise templates for them cannot be prepared in advance. To solve this problem, we propose new template-adaptation and template-matching methods. The former method adapts a single seed template prepared for each kind of drums to the corresponding drum sound appearing in an actual musical piece. The latter method then can detect all the onsets of each drum by using the corresponding adapted template. The onsets of bass and snare drums in any piece can thus be identiﬁed. Experimental results showed that the accuracy of identifying bass and snare drums in popular music was about 90%.

"Cory McKay;Ichiro Fujinaga";Automatic Genre Classification Using Large High-Level Musical Feature Sets.;2004;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416158;This paper presents a system that extracts 109 musical features from symbolic recordings (MIDI, in this case) and uses them to classify the recordings by genre. The features used here are based on instrumentation, texture, rhythm, dynamics, pitch statistics, melody and chords. The classification is performed hierarchically using different sets of features at different levels of the hierarchy. Which features are used at each level, and their relative weightings, are determined using genetic algorithms. Classification is performed using a novel ensemble of feedforward neural networks and k-nearest neighbour classifiers. Arguments are presented emphasizing the importance of using high-level musical features, something that has been largely neglected in automatic classification systems to date in favour of low-level features. The effect on classification performance of varying the number of candidate features is examined in order to empirically demonstrate the importance of using a large variety of musically meaningful features. Two differently sized hierarchies are used in order to test the performance of the system under different conditions. Very encouraging classification success rates of 98% for root genres and 90% for leaf genres are obtained for a hierarchical taxonomy consisting of 9 leaf genres.;"Cory McKay, McGill University, CAN, education;Ichiro Fujinaga, McGill University, CAN, education";McGill University, McGill University;education, education;CAN, CAN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;0.596841;31.8091

Yet, despite the popularity of Web services in the business sector and their seemingly obvious applicability to the digital library domain, and to MIR in particular, the adoption of these new protocols has not been widespread. To demonstrate the tremendous potential of Web services for MIR, this paper presents an application using the Google and Amazon.com databases to generate clusters of related musical artists based on cultural metadata. The use of cultural metadata to determine artist relatedness is valuable and interesting because it captures emergent popular opinion about music. Starting from an initial seed artist, Amazon Listmania! lists are traversed to find potentially related artists. Google is used to determine which of these candidates are in fact related by assessing the co-occurrence of the two artists’ names on Internet web pages. A list of artists related to the seed is returned once a given number of artists is found.

Although there is a long tradition in extracting information from acoustic signals, the field of music information extraction is largely heuristic in nature. We present here a heuristic-based generic approach for extracting automatically high-level music descriptors from acoustic signals. This approach is based on Genetic Programming, used to build relevant features as functions of mathematical and signal processing operators. The search of relevant features is guided by specialized heuristics that embody knowledge about the signal processing functions built by the system. Signal processing patterns are used in order to control the general processing methods. In addition, rewriting rules are introduced to simplify overly complex expressions, and a caching system further reduces the computing cost of each cycle. Finally, the features build by the system are combined into an optimized machine learning descriptor model, and an executable program is generated to compute the model on any audio signal.

"Peter Jan O. Doets;Reginald L.

A suitable audio ﬁngerprint can be used to identify audio ﬁles, even if they are severely degraded due to compression or other types of signal processing operations. When degraded, the ﬁngerprint closely resembles the ﬁngerprint of the original, but is not identical. We plan to use a ﬁngerprint not only to identify the song but also to assess the perceptual quality of the compressed content. In order to develop such a ﬁngerprinting scheme, a model is needed to assess the behavior of a ﬁngerprint subject to compression. In this paper we present the initial outlines of a model for an existing robust ﬁngerprinting system to develop a more theoretical foundation. The model describes the stochastic behavior of the system when the input signal is a stationary (stochastic) signal. In this paper the input is assumed to be white noise.

Finding music in large collections can be hard if one does not know exactly what to look for. In this paper a novel user interface to browse and navigate through music on small devices is proposed, together with the enabling algorithms. The goal of this interface is to enable the users to explore and discover their entire collection and to support non-specific searches. To this end, a new way to visualize and navigate through music is introduced: the artist map. The artist map is designed to provide an overview of an entire music collection, or a subset thereof, by clearly visualizing the similarity between artists, computed from the music itself. Contextual information (e.g. mood, genre) is added by coloring and by attribute magnets. The artist map is implemented by a graph-drawing algorithm, which uses an improved energy model.

Jane Singer;Creating a nested melodic representation: competition and cooperation among bottom-up and top-down Gestalt principles.;2004;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417965;A set of principles (based on Gestalt theory) governing how we group notes into meaningful groups has been widely accepted in the literature. Based on these principles, many divergent theories of melodic segmentation and representation have been proposed. However, these theories have not succeeded in achieving a comprehensive and verifiable representation of melody. This is largely due to the fact that multiple competing segmenting factors produce, for any single melody, a large number of possible segmentations and therefore representations. Here a model is proposed, which incorporates widely accepted principles of segmentation. These rules govern three types of factors: (1) changes in proximity (for producing disjunctive segmentation), (2) changes in overall contour and intervallic texture and (3) patterns and periodicity that create parallelism among segments. Because of the nature of the segmentation rules, these same rules establish the attributes of the groups they produce. Based on original research in Singer 2004, principles for establishing preferences among competing rules are formulated in order to create a few preferred representations for approximately 1,000 monophonic folksongs.;Jane Singer, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, The Department of Musicology, ISR, education;The Hebrew University of Jerusalem;education;ISR;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies;-18.524403;-7.0613875

Our method employs a supervised learning approach by using a training set of aligned symbolic and acoustic representations. The alignment function we devise is based on mapping the input acoustic-symbolic representation along with the target alignment into an abstract vector-space. Building on techniques used for learning support vector machines (SVM), our alignment function distills to a classiﬁer in the abstract vector-space which separates correct alignments from incorrect ones. We describe a simple iterative algorithm for learning the alignment function and discuss its formal properties. We use our method for aligning MIDI and MP3 representations of polyphonic recordings of piano music.

Among the major drawbacks to these approaches are the long running times as well as the large memory requirements. In this paper we present an algorithm, which solves the synchronization problem accurately and efﬁciently for complex, polyphonic piano music. In a ﬁrst step, we extract from the audio data stream a set of highly expressive features encoding note onset candidates separately for all pitches. This makes computations efﬁcient since only a small number of such features is sufﬁcient to solve the synchronization task. Based on a suitable matching model, the best match between the score and the feature parameters is computed by dynamic programming (DP). To further cut down the computational cost in the synchronization process, we introduce the concept of anchor matches, matches which can be easily established. Then the DP-based technique is locally applied between adjacent anchor matches.

Our approach is based on the self-similarity analysis of the audio recording and does not assume the presence of percussive instruments.

Klaus Frieler;Beat and meter extraction using gaussified onsets.;2004;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417851;Rhythm, beat and meter are key concepts of music in general. Many efforts had been made in the last years to automatically extract beat and meter from a piece of music given either in audio or symbolical representation (see e.g. [11] for an overview). In this paper we propose a new method for extracting beat, meter and phase information from a list of unquantized onset times.

The applicability for an automated analysis and classification was tested on a folk song collection from Luxembourg that had been thoroughly analysed by an expert ethnomusicologist. Firstly a systematization of the currently available approaches to similarity measurements of melodies was done. About 50 similarity measures were implemented which differ in the way of transforming musical data and in the computational algorithms. Three listener experiments were conducted to compare the performance of the different measures to human experts’ ratings. Then an optimized model was obtained by using linear regression, which combines the output of several measures representing different musical dimensions. The performance of this optimized measure was compared with the classification work of a human ethnomusicologist on a collection of 577 Luxembourg folksongs.;"Daniel Müllensiefen, University of Hamburg, DEU, education;Klaus Frieler, University of Hamburg, DEU, education";University of Hamburg, University of Hamburg;education, education;DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-14.006775;-3.9610589

The method contains both a surface level and a paradigmatic level analysing block and works in two phases. In the first phase, each music document of a collection is analysed separately: They are first divided into phrases that are consequently fed on a harmonic analyser. The paradigmatic structure of a given music document is achieved comparing both the melodic and the harmonic similarities among its phrases. In the second phase, the collection of music documents is clustered on the ground of their paradigmatic structures and surface levels. Our experimental results show that the novel method finds some interesting, underlying similarities that cannot be found using only surface level analysis.;"Anna Pienimäki, University of Helsinki, FIN, education;Kjell Lemström, University of Helsinki, FIN, education";University of Helsinki, University of Helsinki;education, education;FIN, FIN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-2.2602978;-7.3565564

Olivier Lartillot;A multi-parametric and redundancy-filtering approach to pattern identification.;2004;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416426;This paper presents the principles of a new approach aimed at automatically discovering motivic patterns in monodies. It is shown that, for the results to agree with the listener’s understanding, computer modelling needs to follow as closely as possible the strategies undertaken during the listening process. Motivic patterns, which may progressively follow different musical dimensions, are discovered through an adaptive incremental identification in a multi-dimensional parametric space. The combinatorial redundancy that would logically result from the model is carefully limited with the help of particular heuristics. In particular, a notion of specificity relation between pattern descriptions is defined, unifying suffix relation – between patterns – and inclusion relation – between the multi-parametric descriptions of patterns. This enables to discard redundant patterns, whose descriptions are less specific than other patterns and whose occurrences are included in the occurrences of the more specific patterns. Resulting analyzes come close to the structures actually perceived by the listener.;Olivier Lartillot, University of Jyväskylä, FIN, education;University of Jyväskylä;education;FIN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;9.607436;0.86286825

For didjeridu, we locate the start of notes using a complex-domain note onset detection algorithm, and use the detected onsets as cues for determining the harmonic series of sinusoids belonging to the didjeridu. The harmonic series is hypothesised, based on prior knowledge of the fundamental frequency of the didjeridu, and the most likely hypothesis is assumed. For clapsticks, we use independent subspace analysis to split the signal into harmonic and percussive components, followed by classiﬁcation of the independent components. Finally, we identify areas in which the system can be enhanced to improve accuracy and also to extract a wider range of musically-relevant features. These include algorithms such as high frequency content techniques, and also computing the morphology of the didjeridu.;"Andrew Nesbit, University of Melbourne, AUS, education;Lloyd Hollenberg, University of Melbourne, AUS, education;Anthony Senyard, University of Melbourne, AUS, education";University of Melbourne, University of Melbourne, University of Melbourne;education, education, education;AUS, AUS, AUS;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;19.06479;-25.8478

While such a transcription into a sequence of (pitch, duration) pairs is convenient and musically intuitive, there is no evidence that it is an optimal representation. The present work explores three time series representations for sung queries: a sequence of notes, a ‘smooth’ pitch contour, and a novel sequence of pitch histograms. Dynamic alignment procedures are described for the three representations. Multiple continuity constraints are explored and a modified dynamic alignment procedure is described for the histogram representation. We measure the performance of the three representations using a collection of naturally sung queries applied to a target database of varying size. The results show that the note representation lends itself to rapid retrieval whereas the contour representation lends itself to robust performance. The histogram representation yields performance nearly as robust as the contour representation, but with computational complexity similar to the note representation.;"Norman H.

Tillman Weyde;The Influence of Pitch on Melodic Segmentation.;2004;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415556;Melodic segmentation is an important topic for music information retrieval, because it divides melodies into musically relevant units. Most inﬂuential theories on melodic segmentation of the last decades have stressed the role of pitch for melodic segmentation. The general assumption was, that relatively large changes or distances in any musical parameter like pitch, time, dynamics, or melodic movement mark segment boundaries. This has generally been accepted despite the lack of empirical studies. Here an empirical study is presented, that investigates the inﬂuence of inter-onset-intervals (IOI), intensity accents, pitch intervals, and pitch interval direction changes. The results show a signiﬁcant inﬂuence only for IOIs and intensity, but neither for pitch intervals nor for changes in interval direction.

"Dan Yang;Won-Sook Lee";Disambiguating Music Emotion Using Software Agents.;2004;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415272;Annotating music poses a cognitive load on listeners and this potentially interferes with the emotions being reported. One solution is to let software agents learn to make the annotator’s task easier and more efficient. Emo is a music annotation prototype that combines inputs from both human and software agents to better study human listening. A compositional theory of musical meaning provides the overall heuristics for the annotation process, with the listener drawing upon different influences such as acoustics, lyrics and cultural metadata to focus on a specific musical mood. Software agents track the way these choices are made from the influences available. A functional theory of human emotion provides the basis for introducing necessary bias into the machine learning agents. Conflicting positive and negative emotions can be separated on the basis of their different function (reward-approach and threat-avoidance) or dysfunction (psychotic). Negative emotions have strong ambiguity and these are the focus of the experiment. The results of mining psychological features of lyrics are promising, recognisable in terms of common sense ideas of emotion and in terms of accuracy. Further ideas for deploying agents in this model of music annotation are presented.;"Dan Yang, University of Ottawa, CAN, education;WonSook Lee, University of Ottawa, CAN, education";University of Ottawa, University of Ottawa;education, education;CAN, CAN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-26.396885;56.71713

In this paper it is proposed to index music documents with frequent musical patterns. A musical pattern is a sequence of features in the score that is repeated at least twice: features can regard perceptually relevant characteristics, such as rhythm, pitch, or both. Data fusion techniques are applied to merge the results obtained using different features. A set of experimental tests has been carried out on retrieval effectiveness, robustness to query errors, and dependency on query length on a collection of Beatles’ songs using a set of queries. The proposed approach gave good results, both using single features and, in particular, merging the rank lists obtained by different features with a data fusion approach.;"Giovanna Neve, University of Padova, ITA, education;Nicola Orio, University of Padova, ITA, education";University of Padova, University of Padova;education, education;ITA, ITA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-22.901176;12.133672

Knowledge sources include an instrument recognition module and temporal knowledge about tone durations and interval transitions, which are integrated in a probabilistic search. The proposed system improved the number of frames with correct F0 estimates by 14% compared to a baseline system which simply uses the strongest F0 at every point in time. The number of spurious tones was reduced to nearly a third compared to the baseline system, resulting in significantly smoother melody lines.;"Jana Eggink, University of Sheffield, GBR, education;Guy J.

In rhythm recognition, the modern continuous speech recognition technique is applied to find the most likely intended note sequence from the given sequence of fluctuating note durations in the performance. Combining stochastic models of note durations deviating from the nominal lengths and a probabilistic grammar representing possible sequences of notes, the problem is formulated as a maximum a posteriori estimation that can be implemented using efficient search based on the Viterbi algorithm. With this, significant improvements compared with conventional “quantization” techniques were found. Tempo analysis is performed by fitting the observed tempo with parametric tempo curves in order to extract tempo dynamics and characteristics of performance to use. Tempo-change timings and parameter values in tempo curve models are estimated through the segmental k-means algorithm.

"Anna Lubiw;Luke Tanur";Pattern Matching in Polyphonic Music as a Weighted Geometric Translation Problem.;2004;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417969;We consider the music pattern matching problem—to ﬁnd occurrences of a small fragment of music called the “pattern” in a larger body of music called the “score”—as a problem of translating a set of horizontal line segments in the plane to ﬁnd the best match in a larger set of horizontal line segments. Our contribution is that we use fairly general weight functions to measure the quality of a match, thus enabling approximate pattern matching. We give an algorithm with running time O(nm log m), where n is the size of the score and m is the size of the pattern. We show that the problem, in this geometric formulation, is unlikely to have a signiﬁcantly faster algorithm because it is at least as hard as a basic problem called 3-SUM that is conjectured to have no subquadratic algorithm.

"Gavin Wood;Simon O'Keefe";A Case Study of Distributed Music Audio Analysis Using the Geddei Processing Framework.;2004;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1414810;Audio signal processing and reﬁnement is an important part of a content-based music information retrieval system. As the our repertoire of techniques becomes more varied, there are greater requirements of computation power. Distributed storage techniques have become widespread and almost invisible with the advent of ﬁle-sharing systems, on-line digital music stores and on line storage services. Even discounting data with potential copyright entanglements, there is a vast amount that is ripe for analysis, and thus parallelised and distributed processing techniques seem increasingly appropriate. Existing frameworks are already capable of a signiﬁcant amount of audio analysis for music information retrieval. However they are by and large ignorant of distribution and parallelisation. There are middleware libraries to help with aspects of distributed computing, but combining the two can be cumbersome and inefﬁcient. This paper provides a brief description of a software framework that can process audio in a scalable and distributed manner: Geddei. The paper then takes an interesting and relevant signal analysis task often used for music information retrieval and implements it under the Geddei framework. The ease of use is discussed and various measurements taken of Geddei, both in comparison to itself under different circumstances, and ‘reference code’ that was used in a previous study. We discuss the problems with the distribution of the task with Geddei and offer some possible solutions.;"Gavin Wood, ;Simon O’Keefe, University of York, GBR, education";University of York, University of York;education, education;GBR, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-26.73852;2.4574742
"Shyamala Doraisamy;Stefan M. Rüger";A Polyphonic Music Retrieval System Using N-Grams.;2004;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417961;This paper describes the development of a polyphonic music retrieval system with the n-gram approach. Musical n-grams are constructed from polyphonic musical performances in MIDI using the pitch and rhythm dimensions of music. These are encoded using text characters enabling the musical words generated to be indexed with existing text search engines. The Lemur Toolkit was adapted for the development of a demonstrator system on a collection of around 10,000 polyphonic MIDI performances. The indexing, search and retrieval with musical n-grams and this toolkit have been extensively evaluated through a series of experimental work over the past three years, published elsewhere. We discuss how the system works internally and describe our proposal for enhancements to Lemur towards the indexing of ‘overlaying’ as opposed to indexing a ‘bag of terms’. This includes enhancements to the parser for a ‘polyphonicmusical word indexer’ to incorporate within document position information when indexing adjacent and concurrent musical words. For retrieval of these ‘overlaying’ musical words, a new proximity-based operator and a ranking function is proposed.;"Shyamala Doraisamy, University Putra Malaysia, MYS, education;Stefan R¨uger, Imperial College London, GBR, education";University Putra Malaysia, Imperial College London;education, education;MYS, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developed economies;-21.527557;9.662531

This hierarchical approach, in which music is separated into elements that are analyzed independently, is convenient for the scientific researcher, but is at odds with intuition about music perception. Music is interconnected at many levels, and the interplay of melody, harmony, and rhythm are important in perception. As a first step toward more holistic music analysis, music structure is used to constrain a beat tracking program. With structural information, the simple beat tracker, working with audio input, shows a large improvement. The implications of this work for other music analysis problems are discussed.;Roger B.

A bootstrap approach is introduced in which audio alignment techniques are first used to find the correspondence between a symbolic music representation (such as MIDI data) and an acoustic recording. This alignment provides an initial estimate of note boundaries which can be used to train a segmenter. Once trained, the segmenter can be used to refine the initial set of note boundaries and training can be repeated. This iterative training process eliminates the need for hand-segmented audio.

For speed, algorithms generally depend on precalculated indexing metadata. Unfortunately, the size of the metadata follows the same exponential trend as the audio data itself, and this may lead to an exponential increase in storage cost and search time. The concept of scalable metadata has been introduced to allow metadata to adjust to such trends and alleviate the effects of forseeable increases of data and metadata size. Here, we argue that scalability ﬁts the needs of the hierarchical structures that allow fast search, and illustrate this by adapting a state-of-the-art search algorithm to a scalable indexing structure.

The model employs a template based key finding algorithm. This algorithm is used in a sliding window fashion to obtain a sequence of tonal center estimates that delineate the trajectory of tonal evolution in tonal space. A chroma based representation is used to capture tonality informa-tion. Templates are formed from instrument sounds weighted according to pitch distribution profiles. For each window in the input audio, the chroma based repre-sentation is interpreted with respect to the precalculated templates that serve as attractor points in tonal space. This leads to a discretization in both time and tonal space making the output representation compact. Local and global variations in tempo are accounted for using dynamic time warping that employs a special type of music theoretical distance measure. Evaluation is given in two stages. The first is evaluation of the key finding model to assess its performance in key finding for raw audio input. The second is based on cross validation testing for pieces that have multiple performances in the database to determine the success of recall by distance.;Özgür İzmirli, Connecticut College, USA, education;Connecticut College;education;USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-10.526255;-0.31112388

The best version of Chew and Chen’s algorithm was the least dependent on style (SD = 0.35) and spelt 99.15% of the notes correctly. A new version of Cambouropoulos’s algorithm, combining features of all three versions described by Cambouropoulos himself, also spelt 99.15% of the notes correctly (SD = 0.47). The best version of Temperley and Sleator’s algorithm spelt 97.79% of the notes correctly, but nearly 70% of its errors were due to a single sudden enharmonic change. Longuet-Higgins’s algorithm spelt 98.21% of the notes correctly (SD = 1.79) but only when it processed the music a voice at a time.;"David Meredith, Goldsmiths’ College, University of London, GBR, education;Geraint A.

We extract both acoustic and lyric information from each song and separate hits from non-hits using standard classiﬁers, speciﬁcally Support Vector Machines and boosting classiﬁers. Our features are based on global sounds learnt in an unsupervised fashion from acoustic data or global topics learnt from a lyrics database. Experiments on a corpus of 1700 songs demonstrate performance that is much better than random. The lyric-based features are slightly more useful than the acoustic features in correctly identifying hit songs. Concatenating the two features does not produce signiﬁcant improvements. Analysis of the lyric-based features shows that the absence of certain semantic information indicates that a song is more likely to be a hit.;"Ruth Dhanaraj, Hewlett Packard Labs, USA, company;Beth Logan, Hewlett Packard Labs, USA, company";Hewlett-Packard Labs,Hewlett-Packard Labs;company, company;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-13.635235;31.18219

Inferring chord progressions is thus an essential step towards modeling long term dependencies in music. In this paper, a distributed representation for chords is designed such that Euclidean distances roughly correspond to psychoacoustic dissimilarities. Estimated probabilities of chord substitutions are derived from this representation and are used to introduce smoothing in graphical models observing chord progressions. Parameters in the graphical models are learnt with the EM algorithm and the classical Junction Tree algorithm is used for inference. Various model architectures are compared in terms of conditional out-of-sample likelihood.

A function representing the position of onsets over time is ﬁrst extracted from the audio signal. From this function we compute at each time a vector which represents the characteristics of the local rhythm. Three feature sets are studied for this vector. They are derived from the amplitude of the Discrete Fourier Transform, the AutoCorrelation Function and the product of the DFT and of a Frequency-Mapped ACF. The vectors are then sampled at some speciﬁc frequencies, which represents various ratios of the local tempo. The ability of the three feature sets to represent the rhythm characteristics of an audio item is evaluated through a classiﬁcation task.

"Masatoshi Hamanaka;Keiji Hirata;Satoshi Tojo";ATTA: Automatic Time-Span Tree Analyzer Based on Extended GTTM.;2005;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415572;This paper describes a music analyzing system called the automatic time-span tree analyzer (ATTA), which we have developed. The ATTA derives a time-span tree that assigns a hierarchy of 'structural importance' to the notes of a piece of music based on the generative theory of tonal music (GTTM). Although the time-span tree has been applied with music summarization and collaborative music creation systems, these systems use time-span trees manually analyzed by experts in musicology. Previous systems based on GTTM cannot acquire a time-span tree without manual application of most of the rules, because GTTM does not resolve much of the ambiguity that exists with the application of the rules. To solve this problem, we propose a novel computational model of the GTTM that re-formalizes the rules with computer implementation. The main advantage of our approach is that we can introduce adjustable parameters, which enables us to assign priority to the rules. Our analyzer automatically acquires time-span trees by configuring the parameters that cover 26 rules out of 36 GTTM rules for constructing a time-span tree. Experimental results showed that after these parameters were tuned, our method outperformed a baseline performance. We hope to distribute the time-span tree as the content for various musical tasks, such as searching and arranging music.;"Masatoshi Hamanaka, Japan Science and Technology Agency, JPN, facility, A.I.S.T., JPN, facility;Keiji Hirata, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, JPN, company;Satoshi Tojo, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, JPN, education";Japan Science and Technology Agency, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology;facility, company, facility;JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-41.49797;-29.400658

To calculate such a ranking, we use asymmetric similarity matrices obtained via co-occurrence analysis of artist names on web pages. We demonstrate our approach on a data set containing 224 artists from 14 genres and evaluate the results using the rank correlation between the prototypicality ranking and a ranking obtained by page counts of search queries to Google that contain artist and genre. High positive rank correlations are achieved for nearly all genres of the data set.

However, “similar” does not mean “the same”. Therefore, techniques for approximate matching are crucial to the development of good music information retrieval systems. Yet as one increases the level of approximation, one ﬁnds not only additional similar, relevant music, but also a larger number of not-as-similar, non-relevant music. The purpose of this work is to show that if two different retrieval systems do approximate matching in different manners, and both give decent results, they can be combined to give results better than either system individually.

Systems are being developed that allow searchers to find melodies, rhythms, genres, and singers or artists, to name but a few. At the heart of all these systems is the need to find models or measures that answer the question “how similar are two given pieces of music”. However, similarity has a variety of meanings depending on the nature of the system being developed. More importantly, the features extracted from a music source are often either single-dimensional (i.e.: only pitch, or only rhythm, or only timbre) or else assumed to be orthogonal. In this paper we present a framework for developing systems which combine a wide variety of non-independent features without having to make the independence assumption.

Because singing voices play an important role in musical pieces with a vocal part, the identification of singer names is useful for music information retrieval systems. The main problem in automatically identifying singers is the negative influences caused by accompaniment sounds. To solve this problem, we developed two methods, accompaniment sound reduction and reliable frame selection. The former method makes it possible to identify the singer of a singing voice after reducing accompaniment sounds. It first extracts harmonic components of the predominant melody from sound mixtures and then resynthesizes the melody by using a sinusoidal model driven by those components. The latter method then judges whether each frame of the obtained melody is reliable (i.e. little influenced by accompaniment sound) or not by using two Gaussian mixture models for vocal and non-vocal frames. It enables the singer identification using only reliable vocal portions of musical pieces. Experimental results with forty popular-music songs by ten singers showed that our method was able to reduce the influences of accompaniment sounds and achieved an accuracy of 95%, while the accuracy for a conventional method was 53%.;"Hiromasa Fujihara, Dept. of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Tetsuro Kitahara, Dept. of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility;Kazunori Komatani, Dept. of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Tetsuya Ogata, Dept. of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Hiroshi G.

Musical instrument identification (MII) is an important task in music information retrieval because MII results make it possible to automatically retrieving certain types of music (e.g., piano sonata, string quartet). Only a few studies, however, have dealt with MII in polyphonic music. In MII in polyphonic music, there are three issues: feature variations caused by sound mixtures, the pitch dependency of timbres, and the use of musical context. For the first issue, templates of feature vectors representing timbres are extracted from not only isolated sounds but also sound mixtures. Because some features are not robust in the mixtures, features are weighted according to their robustness by using linear discriminant analysis. For the second issue, we use an F0-dependent multivariate normal distribution, which approximates the pitch dependency as a function of fundamental frequency. For the third issue, when the instrument of each note is identified, the a priori probability of the note is calculated from the a posteriori probabilities of temporally neighboring notes.

In particular, we shall propose enhancement to CHMM and demonstrate that with the enhancement scheme, CHMM can compare favourably with DTW in both efficiency and effectiveness.;"Jyh-Shing Roger Jang, National Tsing Hua University, TWN, education;Chao-Ling Hsu, National Tsing Hua University, TWN, education;Hong-Ru Lee, National Tsing Hua University, TWN, education";National Tsing Hua University, National Tsing Hua University, National Tsing Hua University;education, education, education;TWN, TWN, TWN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;-47.71853;-21.17688

"Bryan Pardo;Manan Sanghi";Polyphonic Musical Sequence Alignment for Database Search.;2005;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417909;Finding the best matching database target to a melodic query has been of great interest in the music IR world. The string alignment paradigm works well for this task when comparing a monophonic query to a database of monophonic pieces. However, most tonal music is polyphonic, with multiple concurrent musical lines. Such pieces are not adequately represented as strings. Moreover, users often represent polyphonic pieces in their queries by skipping from one part (the soprano) to another (the bass). Current string matching approaches are not designed to handle this situation. This paper outlines approaches to extending string alignment that allow measuring similarity between a monophonic query and a polyphonic piece. These approaches are compared using synthetic queries on a database of Bach pieces. Results indicate that when a monophonic query is drawn from multiple parts in the target, a method which explicitly takes the multi-part structure of a piece into account significantly outperforms the one that does not.;"Bryan Pardo, Northwestern University, USA, education;Manan Sanghi, Northwestern University, USA, education";Northwestern University, Northwestern University;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-14.921335;-28.89857

Full semantic transcription of audio is an unreliable and imperfect task in the best case, an unsolved problem in the worst. To this end we propose a robust mid-level representation that incorporates both harmonic and rhythmic information, without attempting full transcription. We describe a process for creating this representation automatically, directly from multi-timbral and polyphonic music signals, with an emphasis on popular music. We also offer various evaluations of our techniques. Moreso than most approaches working from raw audio, we incorporate musical knowledge into our assumptions, our models, and our processes.

The current work extends previous work by Gillet and Richard (2003) on categorizing tabla strokes, by using a larger, more diverse database that includes their data as a benchmark, and by testing neural networks and tree-based classification methods. First, the time-domain signal was segmented using complex-domain thresholding that looked for sudden changes in amplitude and phase discontinuities. At the optimal point on the ROC curve, false positives were less than 1% and false negatives were less than 2%. Then, classification was performed using a multivariate Gaussian model (mv gauss) as well as non-parametric techniques such as probabilistic neural networks (pnn), feed-forward neural networks (ffnn), and tree-based classifiers. Two evaluation protocols were used. The first used 10-fold cross validation.

"Meinard Müller;Frank Kurth;Michael Clausen";Audio Matching via Chroma-Based Statistical Features.;2005;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416800;In this paper, we describe an efﬁcient method for audio matching which performs effectively for a wide range of classical music. The basic goal of audio matching can be described as follows: consider an audio database containing several CD recordings for one and the same piece of music interpreted by various musicians. Then, given a short query audio clip of one interpretation, the goal is to automatically retrieve the corresponding excerpts from the other interpretations. To solve this problem, we introduce a new type of chroma-based audio feature that strongly correlates to the harmonic progression of the audio signal. Our feature shows a high degree of robustness to variations in parameters such as dynamics, timbre, articulation, and local tempo deviations. As another contribution, we describe a robust matching procedure, which allows to handle global tempo variations. Finally, we give a detailed account on our experiments, which have been carried out on a database of more than 110 hours of audio comprising a wide range of classical music.;"Meinard M¨uller, Universität Bonn, Institut für Informatik III, DEU, education;Frank Kurth, Universität Bonn, Institut für Informatik III, DEU, education;Michael Clausen, Universität Bonn, Institut für Informatik III, DEU, education";University of Bonn,University of Bonn,University of Bonn;education, education, education;DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;14.9716015;25.70491

Using the SyncPlayer client interface, a user may play back an audio recording that is locally available on his computer. The recording is then identiﬁed by the SyncPlayer server, a process which is performed entirely content-based. Subsequently, the server delivers music-related data like scores or lyrics to the client, which are then displayed synchronously with audio playback using a multimodal visualization plug-in. In addition to visualization, the system provides functionality for content-based music retrieval and semi-manual content annotation. To the best of our knowledge, our system is moreover the ﬁrst to systematically exploit automatically generated synchronization data for content-based symbolic browsing in high quality audio recordings. SyncPlayer has already proved to be a valuable tool for evaluating algorithms in MIR research on a larger scale.

The scientific literature presents a vast collection of descriptors (e.g. energy, tempo, tonality) each one representing a significant effort of research in finding an appropriate descriptor for a particular application. The Extractor Discovery System (EDS) [1] is a recent approach for the discovery of such descriptors, which aim is to extract them automatically. This system can be useful for both non experts – who can let the system work fully automatically – and experts – who can start the system with an initial solution expecting it to enhance their results. Nevertheless, EDS still needs to be massively tested. We consider that its comparison with the results of problems already studied would be very useful to validate it as an effective tool.

"Aggelos Pikrakis;Sergios Theodoridis";A Novel HMM Approach to Melody Spotting in Raw Audio Recordings.;2005;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1414886;This paper presents a melody spotting system based on Variable Duration Hidden Markov Models (VDHMM’s), capable of locating monophonic melodies in a database of raw audio recordings. The audio recordings may either contain a single instrument performing in solo mode, or an ensemble of instruments where one of the instruments has a leading role. The melody to be spotted is presented to the system as a sequence of note durations and music intervals. In the sequel, this sequence is treated as a pattern prototype and based on it, a VDHMM is constructed. The probabilities of the associated VDHMM are determined according to a set of rules that account (a) for the allowable note duration flexibility and (b) with possible structural deviations from the prototype pattern. In addition, for each raw audio recording in the database, a sequence of note durations and music intervals is extracted by means of a multi pitch tracking algorithm. These sequences are subsequently fed as input to the constructed VDHMM that models the pattern to be located. The VDHMM employs an enhanced Viterbi algorithm, previously introduced by the authors, in order to account for pitch tracking errors and performance improvisations of the instrument players. For each audio recording in the database, the best-state sequence generated by the enhanced Viterbi algorithm is further post-processed in order to locate occurrences of the melody which is searched. Our method has been successfully tested with a variety of cello recordings in the context of Western Classical music, as well as with Greek traditional multi-instrument recordings, in which clarinet has a leading role.;"Aggelos Pikrakis, University of Athens, GRC, education;Sergios Theodoridis, University of Athens, GRC, education";University of Athens, University of Athens;education, education;GRC, GRC;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;16.232052;-12.421602

A constant-Q pitch detector following the work of Brown and Puckette provides pitch tracks which are post processed in such a way as to identify likely transitions between notes. A core part of this preparation of the pitch detector signal is an algorithm for vibrato suppression. An evaluation task is undertaken on slow attack and high vibrato PNP source ﬁles with human annotated onsets, exemplars of a difﬁcult case in monophonic source segmentation. The pitch track onset detection algorithm shows an improvement over the previous best performing algorithm from a recent comparison study of onset detectors.

A digital camera is a particularly effective way of achieving this, but there are several issues with the quality of the captured image, including distortions in the shape of the image due to the camera not being aligned properly with the page, non-planarity of the page, lens distortion from close-up shots, and inconsistent lighting across the page. In this paper we explore ways to improve the quality of music images captured by a digital camera or an inexpensive scanner, where the user is not expected to pay a lot of attention to the process. Such pre-processing will signiﬁcantly aid Music Information Retrieval indexing through Optical Music Recognition, for example. The research presented here is primarily based around using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to determine the orientation of the page.

Rui Pedro Paiva;On the Detection of Melody Notes in Polyphonic Audio.;2005;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417681;This paper describes a method for melody detection in polyphonic musical signals. Our approach starts by obtaining a set of pitch candidates for each time frame, with recourse to an auditory model. Trajectories of the most salient pitches are then constructed. Next, note candidates are obtained by trajectory segmentation (in terms of frequency and pitch salience variations). Too short, low-salience and harmonically related notes are then eliminated. Finally, the notes comprising the melody are extracted. This is the main topic of this paper. We select the melody notes by making use of note saliences and melodic smoothness. First, we select the notes with highest pitch salience at each moment. Then, by the melodic smoothness principle, we exploit the fact that tonal melodies are usually smooth. Thus, long music intervals indicate the presence of possibly erroneous notes, which are substituted by notes that smooth out the melodic contour. Finally, false positives in the extracted melody should be eliminated. To this end, we remove spurious notes that correspond to abrupt drops in note saliences or durations. Additionally, note clustering is conducted to further discriminate between true melody notes and false positives.;"Rui Pedro Paiva, Centre for Informatics and Systems of the University of Coimbra, PRT, education;Teresa Mendes, Centre for Informatics and Systems of the University of Coimbra, PRT, education;Amílcar Cardoso, Centre for Informatics and Systems of the University of Coimbra, PRT, education";University of Coimbra,University of Coimbra,University of Coimbra;education, education, education;PRT, PRT, PRT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;20.73003;-17.031532

Olivier Lartillot;Efficient Extraction of Closed Motivic Patterns in Multi-Dimensional Symbolic Representations of Music.;2005;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1418129;An efﬁcient model for discovering repeated patterns in symbolic representations of music is presented. Combinatorial redundancy inherent in the pattern discovery paradigm is usually ﬁltered using global selective mechanisms, based on pattern frequency and length. The proposed approach is founded instead on the concept of closed pattern, and insures lossless compression through an adaptive selection of most speciﬁc descriptions in the multi-dimensional parametric space. A notion of cyclic pattern is introduced, enabling the ﬁltering of another form of combinatorial redundancy provoked by successive repetitions of patterns. The use of cyclic patterns implies a necessary chronological scanning of the piece, and the addition of mechanisms formalising particular Gestalt principles. This study shows therefore that automated analysis of music cannot rely on simple mathematical or statistical approaches, but requires instead a complex and detailed modelling of the cognitive system ruling the listening processes. The resulting algorithm is able to offer for the ﬁrst time compact and relevant motivic analyses of monodies, and may therefore be applied to automated indexing of symbolic music databases. Numerous additional mechanisms need to be added in order to consider all aspects of music expression, including polyphony and complex motivic transformations.;Olivier Lartillot, University of Jyvaskyla, FIN, education;University of Jyväskylä;education;FIN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-1.181369;-7.8540363

"Douglas Eck;Norman Casagrande";Finding Meter in Music Using An Autocorrelation Phase Matrix and Shannon Entropy.;2005;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415650;This paper introduces a novel way to detect metrical structure in music. We introduce a way to compute autocorrelation such that the distribution of energy in phase space is preserved in a matrix. The resulting autocorrelation phase matrix is useful for several tasks involving metrical structure. First we can use the matrix to enhance standard autocorrelation by calculating the Shannon entropy at each lag. This approach yields improved results for autocorrelationbased tempo induction. Second, we can efﬁciently search the matrix for combinations of lags that suggest particular metrical hierarchies. This approach yields a good model for predicting the meter of a piece of music. Finally we can use the phase information in the matrix to align a candidate meter with music, making it possible to perform beat induction with an autocorrelation-based model. We present results for several meter prediction and tempo induction datasets, demonstrating that the approach is competitive with models designed speciﬁcally for these tasks. We also present preliminary beat induction results on a small set of artiﬁcial patterns.;"Douglas Eck, University of Montreal, CAN, education;Norman Casagrande, University of Montreal, CAN, education";University of Montreal, University of Montreal;education, education;CAN, CAN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;3.2143133;-0.7979201

"John Ashley Burgoyne;Lawrence K. Saul";Learning Harmonic Relationships in Digital Audio with Dirichlet-Based Hidden Markov Models.;2005;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1414870;Harmonic analysis is a standard musicological tool for understanding many pieces of Western classical music and making comparisons among them. Traditionally, this analysis is done on paper scores, and most past research in machine-assisted analysis has begun with digital representations of them. Human music students are also taught to hear their musical analyses, however, in both musical recordings and performances. Our approach attempts to teach machines to do the same, beginning with a corpus of recorded Mozart symphonies. The audio files are first transformed into an ordered series of normalized pitch class profile (PCP) vectors. Simplified rules of tonal harmony are encoded in a transition matrix. Classical music tends to change key more frequently than popular music, and so these rules account not only for chords, as most previous work has done, but also for the keys in which they function. A hidden Markov model (HMM) is used with this transition matrix to train Dirichlet distributions for major and minor keys on the PCP vectors. The system tracks chords and keys successfully and shows promise for a real-time implementation.;"J. Ashley Burgoyne, University of Pennsylvania, USA, education;Lawrence K.

"Ching-Hua Chuan;Elaine Chew";Fuzzy Analysis in Pitch-Class Determination for Polyphonic Audio Key Finding.;2005;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417297;This paper presents a fuzzy analysis technique for pitch class determination that improves the accuracy of key finding from audio information. Errors in audio key finding, typically incorrect assignments of closely related keys, commonly result from imprecise pitch class determination and biases introduced by the quality of the sound. Our technique is motivated by hypotheses on the sources of audio key finding errors, and uses fuzzy analysis to reduce the errors caused by noisy detection of lower pitches, and to refine the biased raw frequency data, in order to extract more correct pitch classes. We compare the proposed system to two others, an earlier one employing only peak detection from FFT results, and another providing direct key finding from MIDI. All three used the same key finding algorithm (Chew’s Spiral Array CEG algorithm) and the same 410 classical music pieces (ranging from Baroque to Contemporary). Considering only the first 15 seconds of music in each piece, the proposed fuzzy analysis technique outperforms the peak detection method by 12.18% on average, matches the performance of direct key finding from MIDI 41.73% of the time, and achieves an overall maximum correct rate of 75.25% (compared to 80.34% for MIDI key finding).;"Ching-Hua Chuan, University of Southern California, USA, education;Elaine Chew, University of Southern California, USA, education";University of Southern California, University of Southern California;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-3.3044555;-34.475582

Many traditional debates within the latter receive infusions of new perspectives from MIR, while research within MIR could be fruitfully pointed in directions suggested by questions of interest within traditional research in the humanities, e.g. the relationship of individual memory to cultural memory, issues regarding cross-cultural understanding and the importance of authenticity in artistic contexts.;Cynthia M.

STC decomposes the energy patterns diffused in timefrequency space, i.e., a time series of power spectrum, into distinct clusters such that each of them is originated from a single sound stream. It becomes clear that the problem is equivalent to geometrically approximating the observed time series of power spectrum by superimposed harmonictemporal structured models (HTMs), whose parameters are directly associated with the speciﬁc acoustic characteristics. The update equations in DA(Deterministic Annealing)EM algorithm for the optimal parameter convergence are derived by formulating the model with Gaussian kernel representation.

Specmurt analysis (Sagayama et al., 2004) is based upon the idea that superimposed harmonic structure pattern can be expressed as a convolution of two components, a fundamental frequency distribution and a ‘common harmonic structure’ function if each underlying tone component has similar harmonic structure pattern. As proved in our previous work (Sagayama et al., 2004) inappropriate common structure function leads to inaccurate analysis results.

Typically, analysis of audio signals utilizes sophisticated signal processing and machine learning techniques that require significant computational resources. Therefore, audio MIR is an area were computational resources are a significant bottleneck. For example, the number of pieces utilized in the majority of existing work in audio MIR is at most a few thousand files. Computing audio features over thousands files can sometimes take days of processing. In this paper, we describe how Marsyas-0.2, a free software framework for audio analysis and synthesis can be used to rapidly implement efficient distributed audio analysis algorithms.

Experiments to determine the dependence of key finding accuracy on dimensionality are presented.

This paper describes a method for tempo tracking which builds on current research in the field. In this algorithm, an autocorrelation surface is calculated from the output of a spectral energy flux onset novelty function. The most salient repetition rate is calculated by cross-correlating dilations of a comb-like prototype spanning multiple frames and the autocorrelation surface. The method addresses tempo tracking through time to account for pieces with variable tempos. In order to compare the performance of our method on music with strong and weak percussive onsets we have evaluated it on both classical music with and without percussion and popular music with percussion.

A well-documented issue, however, is that the performance of these systems degrades when music from different albums is used for training and evaluation. Conversely, accuracy improves when systems are trained and evaluated using music from the same album. This performance characteristic has been labeled the “album effect”. The unfortunate corollary to this result is that the classiﬁcation results of these systems are based not entirely on the music itself, but on other audio features common to the album that may be unrelated to the underlying music. We hypothesize that one of the primary reasons for this phenomenon is the production process of commercial recordings, speciﬁcally, post-production. Understanding the primary aspects of post-production, we can attempt to model its effect on the acoustic features used for classiﬁcation.

A generative probabilistic model is proposed, based on three principles: 1) melodies tend to remain within a narrow pitch range; 2) note-to-note intervals within a melody tend to be small; 3) notes tend to conform to a distribution (or “key-profile”) that depends on the key.

"Jeremy Reed;Chin-Hui Lee";A Study on Music Genre Classification Based on Universal Acoustic Models.;2006;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417255;Classification of musical genres gives a useful measure of similarity and is often the most useful descriptor of a musical piece. Previous techniques to use hidden Markov models (HMMs) for automatic genre classification have used a single HMM to model an entire song or genre. This paper provides a framework to give finer segmentation of HMMs through acoustic segment modeling. Modeling each of these acoustic segments with an HMM builds a timbral dictionary in the same fashion that one would create a phonetic dictionary for speech. A symbolic transcription is created by finding the most likely sequence of symbols. These transcriptions then serve as inputs into an efficient text classifier utilized to provide a solution to the genre classification problem. This paper demonstrates that language-ignorant approaches provide results that are consistent with the current state-of-the-art for the genre classification problem. However, the finer segmentation potentially allows for “musical language”-based syntactic rules to enhance performance.;"Jeremy Reed, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, education;Chin-Hui Lee, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, education";Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-0.20641686;31.595251

The intersection contains portions that are similar, when one song is a derivative work of the other for example, in two different musical recordings. To scale our search to large song databases we have developed an algorithm based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) of sequences of audio features called audio shingles. LSH provides an efﬁcient means to identify approximate nearest neighbors in a high-dimensional feature space. We combine these nearest neighbor estimates, each a match from a very large database of audio to a small portion of the query song, to form a measure of the approximate similarity. We demonstrate the utility of our methods on a derivative works retrieval experiment using both exact and approximate (LSH) methods. The results show that LSH is at least an order of magnitude faster than the exact nearest neighbor method and that accuracy is not impacted by the approximate method.;"Michael Casey, Goldsmiths College, University of London, GBR, education;Malcolm Slaney, Yahoo!

We review here the underlying hypotheses, compare them and propose improvements over current state of the art.

The proposed algorithm is quite different from others in the literature both in its purpose and approach.

It is common to treat the Harmonic Series as the main characteristic of the timbre of pitched musical instruments. But does the Harmonic Series indeed contain the complete information required for discriminating among different musical instruments? Could the non-harmonic Residual, the “noise”, be used all by itself for instrument recognition? The paper begins by performing musical instrument recognition with an extensive sound collection using a large set of feature descriptors, achieving a high instrument recognition rate. Next, using Additive Analysis/Synthesis, each sound sample is resynthesized using solely its Harmonic Series. These “Harmonic” samples are then subtracted from the original samples to retrieve the non-harmonic Residuals. Instrument recognition is performed on the resynthesized and the “Residual” sound sets. The paper shows that the Harmonic Series by itself is indeed enough for achieving a high instrument recognition rate; however, the non-harmonic Residuals by themselves can also be used for distinguishing among musical instruments, although with lesser success. Using feature selection, the best 10 feature descriptors for instrument recognition out of our extensive feature set are presented for the Original, Harmonic and Residual sound sets.";"Arie Livshin, IRCAM Centre Pompidou, FRA, facility;Xavier Rodet, IRCAM Centre Pompidou, FRA, facility";IRCAM,IRCAM;facility, facility;FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;44.91274;-10.995235

Using previous music players with normal headphones, we can hear only one song at a time and we thus have to play pieces individually to select the one we want to hear from numerous new music files, which involves a large number of mouse operations. The main advantage of our headphones is that they detect natural movements, such as the head or hand moving when users are listening to music and they can focus on a particular musical source that they want to hear. By moving their head left or right, listeners can hear the source from a frontal position as the digital compass detects the change in the direction they are facing. By looking up or down, the tilt sensor will detect the change in the face’s angle of elevation; they can better hear the source that is allocated to a more distant or closer position. By putting their hand behind their ear, listeners can adjust the focus sensor on the headphones to focus on a particular musical source that they want to hear.";"Masatoshi Hamanaka, Japan Science and Technology Agency, JPN, facility;Seunghee Lee, University of Tsukuba, JPN, education";Japan Science and Technology Agency, University of Tsukuba;facility, education;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-39.01912;6.573448

To this end, we use the page counts provided by Google to estimate the relatedness of an arbitrary artist to each of a set of genres. We investigate four different query schemes for obtaining the page counts and two different probabilistic approaches for predicting the genre of a given artist. Evaluation is performed on two test collections, a large one with a quite general genre taxonomy and a quite small one with rather speciﬁc genres. Since our approach yields estimates for the relatedness of an artist to every genre of a given genre set, we can derive genre distributions which incorporate information about artists that cannot be assigned a single genre. This allows us to overcome the inﬂexible artist-genre assignment usually used in music information systems. We present a simple method to visualize such genre distributions with our Traveller’s Sound Player.

Most of them are based on features that are not intuitively understandable to humans, as they do not have a musically meaningful counterpart, but are merely measures of basic physical properties of the audio signal. Furthermore, most of these algorithms do not take into account the temporal development of the audio signal, which certainly is an important aspect of music. All of them consider the musical signal as a whole, not trying to reconstruct the listening process of dividing the signal into a number of sources. In this work, we present a novel approach to ﬁll this gap by combining a number of existing ideas. At the heart of our approach, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) decomposes an audio signal into individual parts that appear maximally independent from each other. We present one basic algorithm to use these components for similarity computations, and evaluate a number of modiﬁcations to it with respect to genre classiﬁcation accuracy.

This induces unreliability in modeling of user preferences; the content similarity does not completely reﬂect the preferences. Our method integrates both rating and content data by using a Bayesian network called an aspect model. Unobservable user preferences are directly represented by introducing latent variables, which are statistically estimated.

The method is computationally very efficient while performing comparably to earlier methods. High efficiency is achieved through multirate accent analysis, discrete cosine transform periodicity analysis, and phase estimation by adaptive comb filtering. During analysis, the music signals are first represented in terms of accentuation on four frequency subbands, and then the accent signals are transformed into periodicity domain. Beat and tatum periods and phases are estimated in a probabilistic setting, incorporating primitive musicological knowledge of beat–tatum relations, the prior distributions, and the temporal continuities of beats and tatums. In an evaluation with 192 songs, the beat tracking accuracy of the proposed method was found comparable to the state of the art. Complexity evaluation showed that the computational cost is less than 1% of earlier methods.

When individual source tracks for a stereo mixture are unavailable, remixing is typically difficult or impossible, since one cannot isolate the individual parts. We describe a method of informed source separation that uses knowledge of the written score and spatial information from an anechoic, stereo mixture to isolate individual sound sources, allowing remixing of stereo mixtures without access to the original source tracks. This method is tested on a corpus of string quartet performances, artificially created using Bach four-part chorale harmonizations and sample violin, viola and cello recordings. System performance is compared in cases where the algorithm has knowledge of the score and those in which it operates blindly. The results show that source separation performance is markedly improved when the algorithm has access to a well-aligned score.;"John Woodruff, Northwestern University, USA, education;Bryan Pardo, Northwestern University, USA, education;Roger Dannenberg, Carnegie Mellon University, USA, education";Northwestern University, Northwestern University, Carnegie Mellon University;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;42.50003;-21.936914

Finally the separation stage uses the detected pitch contour to group the time-frequency segments of the singing voice.

The key space is modelled by a 24-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM), where each state represents one of the 24 major and minor keys, and each observation represents a chord transition, or pair of consecutive chords. The use of chord transitions as the observations models a greater temporal dependency between consecutive chords than would observations of single chords. The key transition and chord emission probabilities are initialised using the results of perceptual tests in order to reﬂect the human expectation of harmonic relationships. HMM parameters are then trained on a per-song basis using handannotated chord symbols, before the model for each song is decoded to give the likelihood of each key at each time frame. Examples of the algorithm as a segmentation technique are given, and its capability to estimate the overall key of a song is evaluated using a data set of 110 Beatles songs, of which 91% were correctly classiﬁed.

A mapping from the Fourier spectrum to a “F0 salience spectrum” is found by optimization using generated training material.

Here, we investigate the perception of structural boundaries to Western popular music and examine the musical cues responsible for their perception. We make links to music theoretical descriptions of structural boundaries and to computational methods for extracting structure. The methods and data presented here are useful for developing and training systems for the automatic extraction of musical structure as it is perceived by listeners.;"Michael J.

"Adi Ruppin;Hezy Yeshurun";MIDI Music Genre Classification by Invariant Features.;2006;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415744;MIDI music genre classification methods are largely based on generic text classification techniques. We attempt to leverage music domain knowledge in order to improve classification results. We combine techniques of selection and extraction of musically invariant features with classification using compression distance similarity metric, which is an approximation of the theoretical, yet computationally intractable, Kolmogorov complexity. We introduce several methods for extracting features which are invariant under certain transformations commonly found in music. These methods, combined with data compression, generate a lossy compressed representation which attempts to preserve feature invariance. We analyze the performance of each method, thus gaining insight into the features that are significant to the human perception of music.;"Adi Ruppin, Tel Aviv University, ISR, education;Hezy Yeshurun, Tel Aviv University, ISR, education";Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv University;education, education;ISR, ISR;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;2.1996562;29.726038

All of these systems use only melody information for retrieval, although lyrics information is also useful for retrieval. In this paper, we propose an MIR system that uses both melody and lyrics information in the singing voice. The MIR system verifies hypotheses output by a lyrics recognizer from a melodic point of view. Each hypothesis has time alignment information between the singing voice and recognized text, and the boundaries of each note can be estimated using the information. As a result, melody information is extracted from the singing voice. On the other hand, the melody information can be calculated from the musical score of the song because the recognized text must be a part of the lyrics of the song. The hypothesis is verified by calculating the similarity between the two types of melody information. From the experimental results, the verification method increased the retrieval accuracy. Especially, it was very effective when the number of words in the user’s singing voice was small. The proposed method increased the retrieval accuracy from 81.3% to 87.4% when the number of words was only three.;"Motoyuki Suzuki, Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, JPN, education;Toru Hosoya, Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, JPN, education;Akinori Ito, Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, JPN, education;Shozo Makino, Graduate School of Engineering, Tohoku University, JPN, education";Tohoku University,Tohoku University,Tohoku University,Tohoku University;education, education, education, education;JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-18.177225;18.101053

The goal of this work is to identify the track that contains the melody using statistical properties of the musical content and pattern recognition techniques.

First, a set of descriptors from each track of the target ﬁle are extracted. These descriptors are the input to a random forest classiﬁer that assigns the probability of being a melodic line to each track.

We induce a population of score-driven performance models using a database of annotated performances extracted from saxophone acoustic recordings of jazz standards. In addition to note-to-note timing transformations that are invariably introduced in human renditions, more extensive alterations that lead to insertions and deletions of notes are usual in jazz performance. In spite of this, inductive approaches usually treat these latter alterations as artifacts. As a ﬁrst step, we integrate part of the alterations occurring in jazz performances in an evolutionary regression tree model based on strongly typed genetic programming (STGP). This is made possible (i) by creating a new regression data type that includes a range of melodic alterations and (ii) by using a similarity measurement based on an edit-distance ﬁt to human performance similarity judgments.

The design of a system to perform this task gives the opportunity to analyze which features are relevant for music similarity. This paper focuses on the analysis of tonal similarity and its application to the identification of different versions of the same piece. This work formulates the situations where a song is versioned and several musical aspects are transformed with respect to the canonical version. A quantitative evaluation is made using tonal descriptors, including chroma representations and tonality.

Most current approaches to music similarity use either low-level signal features, such as MFCCs that mostly capture timbral characteristics of music and contain little semantic information, or require symbolic representations, which are difficult to obtain from audio signals. The proposed mid-level representation is our attempt to bridge the gap between audio and symbolic domains by providing an integrated melodic, rhythmic and structural representation of music signals. The representation is based on a set of melodic fragments extracted from prominent melodic lines, it is beat-synchronous, which makes it independent of tempo variations and contains information on repetitions of short melodic phrases within the analyzed piece. We show how it can be calculated automatically from polyphonic audio signals and demonstrate its use for discovering melodic similarities between songs. We present results obtained by using the representation for finding different interpretations of songs in a music collection.;Matija Marolt, University of Ljubljana, SVN, education;University of Ljubljana;education;SVN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-14.713811;-0.9392187

The different models are weighted and combined to provide an overall music similarity measure. The system is tested on a small set of popular music files spanning eleven different genres. The system is tuned to estimate genre boundaries using multidimensional scaling – a technique that allows for quick visualization of similarity data.

The properties we examine are key frequencies and average time in key, and we propose two metrics, based on the L 1 and L 2 norms, for quantifying similarity using these descriptors. The methods are applied to 711 classical themes and variations over 71 variation sets by 10 composers of different genres. Quantile-quantile plots and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov measure show that the proposed metrics exhibit strongly distinct behaviour when assessing pieces from the same variation set, and those that are not. Comparisons across variation sets by the same composer, and comparisons of pieces by different composers although result in similar distributions, are derived from fundamentally different underlying distributions, according to the K-S measure. We present probabilistic analyses of the two methods based on the distributions derived empirically. When the discrimination threshold is set at 55, the probabilities of Type I and Type II errors are 18.41% and 20.56% respectively for Method 1, and 15.72% and 22.94% respectively for Method 2.

Megan A. Winget;Heroic Frogs Save the Bow: Performing Musician's Annotation and Interaction Behavior with Written Music.;2006;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417709;Although there have been a number of fairly recent studies in which researchers have explored the information seeking and management behaviors of people interacting with musical retrieval systems, there have been very few published studies of the interaction and use behaviors of musicians themselves. The qualitative research study reported here seeks to correct this deficiency in the literature. Drawing on data collected from nearly 300 annotated parts representing 15 unique works, and 20 musician interviews, we make a number of functionality recommendations for constructive music digital library tool development. For example, all musicians annotate their written music, although this action seems to become more important as the musician becomes more skilled. Musicians’ annotations are comprehensible to anyone who can read music, and are valuable as records of interpretation, interaction, and performance. Musicians annotate at the note (rather than at the phrase or movement) level, their annotations are standardized and formal, and are largely non-text. Music digital libraries that cater to musicians should attempt to provide annotation tools that work at the micro level, and extend the symbolic language of the primary document. Furthermore, preserving the annotations for future use would prove valuable for performance students, professionals, and historians alike.;Megan Winget, University of Texas at Austin, USA, education;University of Texas at Austin;education;USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-28.9711;28.305086

Transforming an audio data stream into a feature sequence, one obtains a self-similarity matrix by pairwise comparing all features of the sequence with respect to a local cost measure. The basic idea is that similar audio segments are revealed as paths of low cost along diagonals in the resulting self-similarity matrix. It is often the case, in particular for classical music, that certain musical parts are repeated in another key. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a transposition-invariant self-similarity matrix, which reveals the repetitive structure even in the presence of key transpositions. Furthermore, we introduce an associated transposition index matrix displaying harmonic relations within the music recording.

Our experiments show that even though the output of current OMR software is often erroneous, the music parameters extracted from the digital images still suffice to derive a reasonable alignment with the audio data stream.

We propose a dynamical hidden Markov model for the score pointer as a prior, and two observation models, the first based on matching spectrogram data to a trained template, the second detecting damped sinusoids within a frame of audio by subspace methods. The resulting Bayesian framework is robust to local variations in tempo, and can be used for a wide variety of applications. We evaluate both methods in a score alignment context by inferring the posterior distribution of the current position in the score exactly.

Machine learning offers one promising approach, but it is limited by the availability of labeled training data.

Thus, large amounts of training data can be generated quickly, but it is limited by the accuracy of the alignment, which in turn is ultimately related to the problem of onset detection. Semi-supervised or bootstrapping techniques can be used to iteratively reﬁne both onset detection functions and the data used to train the functions.

Özgür Izmirli;Localized Key Finding from Audio Using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Segmentation.;2007;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417197;A model for localized key finding from audio is proposed. Besides being able to estimate the key in which a piece starts, the model can also identify points of modulation and label multiple sections with their key names throughout a single piece. The front-end employs an adaptive tuning stage prior to spectral analysis and calculation of chroma features. The segmentation stage uses groups of contiguous chroma vectors as input and identifies sections that are candidates for unique local keys in relation to their neighboring key centers. Non-negative matrix factorization with additional sparsity constraints and additive updates is used for segmentation. The use of segmentation is demonstrated for single and multiple key estimation problems. A correlational model of key finding is applied to the candidate segments to estimate the local keys. Evaluation is given on three different data sets and a range of analysis parameters.;Özgür İzmirli, Connecticut College, USA, education;Connecticut College;education;USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;13.105467;8.448642

The constraints come naturally in the context of music applications. For example, constraints can be generated from the background knowledge (e.g., two artists share similar styles) and the user access patterns (e.g., two pieces of music share similar access patterns across multiple users). We present an approach based on the generalized constraint clustering algorithm by incorporating the constraints for grouping music by “similar” artists. The approach is evaluated on a data set consisting of 53 albums covering 41 popular artists. The “correctness” of the clusters generated is tested using artist similarity provided by All Music Guide.;"Wei Peng, Florida International University, USA, education;Tao Li, Florida International University, USA, education;Mitsunori Ogihara, University of Rochester, USA, education";Florida International University, Florida International University, University of Rochester;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;3.2002583;14.7131405

The core idea is an appropriate selection of the sinusoidal components of the signal to be detected. This new descriptor is robust against usual distortions found in audioID tasks. It has several advantages compared to classical subband-based descriptors including an increased robustness to additive noise, especially non-random noise such as additional speech, and a robust detection of short audio events.

While the key spanning component represents relationships between diﬀerent keys, the key related component is suitable for the analysis of inner relationships of diatonic keys, for example tension or resolution tendencies, or functional relationships.

Two methods are introduced: the calculation of the tuning frequency over an entire audio piece, and the estimation of an adapting reference frequency for a single voice. The results for the tuning frequency estimation look very good for audio pieces where the dominant voices are tuned close to the equal-temperament scale and exhibit only moderate frequency dynamics. For the analysis of popular western music, the method does not achieve very robust results due to the strong frequency dynamics of the human singing voice. Nevertheless, the method could be improved by excluding the singing voice from the calculation taking only the accompaniment into account. The main advantage of the proposed method lies especially in the easy computation of an adaptive reference frequency using an exponential moving average. This adaptive reference can for example be used in the quantization of the singing voice into a note representation.;"Karin Dressler, Fraunhofer IDMT, DEU, facility;Sebastian Streich, Pompeu Fabra University, ESP, education";Fraunhofer IDMT, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;facility, education;DEU, ESP;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;50.4707;-8.562913

Labels, such as genre, are often used as ground-truth for describing song similarity in music information retrieval (MIR) systems. A consistent labelling scheme is usually a key in determining quality of classifier learning in training and performance in testing of an MIR system. We examine links between conventional genre-based taxonomies and acoustical attributes available in text-based descriptions of songs. We show that the vector representation of each song based on these acoustic attributes enables a framework for unsupervised clustering of songs to produce alternative labels and quantitative measures of similarity between songs.

When classiﬁcation was done on 60s segments, a maximum classiﬁcation accuracy of 99.0% was attained in a cross-validation experiment.

In general there are two tempo extraction methods, either based on the estimation of inter-onset intervals or based on self similarity computations. To predict a tempo the most significant time-lag or the most significant inter-onset-interval is used. We propose to use existing rhythm patterns and reformulate the tempo extraction problem in terms of a nearest neighbor classification problem. Our experiments, based on three different datasets, show that this novel approach performs at least comparably to state-of-the-art tempo extraction algorithms and could be useful to get a deeper insight into the relation between perceived tempo and rhythm patterns.;"Klaus Seyerlehner, Johannes Kepler University Linz, AUT, education;Gerhard Widmer, Johannes Kepler University Linz, AUT, education, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, AUT, facility;Dominik Schnitzer, Johannes Kepler University Linz, AUT, education, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, AUT, facility";Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University;education, education, education;AUT, AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;46.685467;19.29998

The system allows these experts to create new musical parameters within a flat data structure [1]. Rockanango is deployed in a commercial environment of hotels, restaurants and cafés. One of the main concerns is the time it takes to manually annotate the music and to introduce new parameters. In this paper, we investigate the possibilities to assist the experts by means of automatic metadata generation. Two case studies are described. One focuses on the use of association rules, in combination with lower level metadata like mode and key. The other case study concerns the generation of a topic or subject marker for songs through harvested lyrics and a keyword generator. From our evaluation, we conclude that the generated keywords are relevant and that the music experts value them higher then laymen.

Although the hybrid system was proved to make accurate recommendations, it lacks efﬁciency and scalability. In other words, the entire model needs to be re-trained from scratch whenever a new score, user, or piece is added. Furthermore, the system cannot deal with practical numbers of users and pieces on an enterprise scale. To improve efﬁciency, we propose an incremental method that partially updates the model at low computational cost. To enhance scalability, we propose a method that ﬁrst constructs a small “core” model over fewer virtual representatives created from real users and pieces, and then adds the real users and pieces to the core model by using the incremental method.

Alan Marsden;Automatic Derivation of Musical Structure: A Tool for Research on Schenkerian Analysis.;2007;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415814;This paper describes software to facilitate research on the automatic derivation of hierarchical (Schenkerian) musical structures from a musical surface. Many MIR tasks require information about musical structure, or would perform better if such information were available. Automatic derivation of musical structure faces two significant obstacles. Firstly, the solution space of possible structural analyses of a piece is very large. Secondly, pieces can have more than one valid structural analysis, and there is little firm agreement among music theorists about how to distinguish a good analysis. To circumvent the first of these obstacles, software has been developed which derives a tractable ‘matrix’ of possibilities from a musical surface (i.e., MIDI-like note-time information). The matrix is somewhat like the intermediate results of a dynamic-programming algorithm, and in a similar way it is possible to extract a particular structural analysis from the matrix by following the appropriate path from the top level to the surface. It therefore provides a tool to facilitate research on the second obstacle by allowing candidate ‘goodness’ metrics to be incorporated into the software and tested on actual music.;Alan Marsden, Lancaster Institute for the Contemporary Arts, Lancaster University, UK, education;Lancaster University;education;GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-27.805042;-35.036385

A problem inherent to genre classiﬁcation experiments in music information retrieval research is the use of songs from the same artist in both training and test sets. We show that this does not only lead to overoptimistic accuracy results but also selectively favours particular classiﬁcation approaches. The advantage of using models of songs rather than models of genres vanishes when applying an artist ﬁlter.

However, current community-based web sites provide richer descriptors (i.e. tags) for all kinds of products. Although tags have no well-deﬁned semantics, they have proven to be an effective mechanism to label and retrieve items. Moreover, these tags are community-based and hence give a description of a product through the eyes of a community rather than an expert opinion. In this work we focus on Last.fm, which is currently the largest music community web service.

We continue our work on designing a well deﬁned ground-truth database for music mood classiﬁcation and show a demonstrator of automatic mood estimation.

"Christopher DeCoro;Zafer Barutçuoglu;Rebecca Fiebrink";Bayesian Aggregation for Hierarchical Genre Classification.;2007;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416012;Hierarchical taxonomies of classes arise in the analysis of many types of musical information, including genre, as a means of organizing overlapping categories at varying levels of generality. However, incorporating hierarchical structure into conventional machine learning systems presents a challenge: the use of independent binary classifiers for each class in the hierarchy can produce hierarchically inconsistent predictions. That is, an example may be assigned to a class, and not assigned to the parent of that class. This paper applies a Bayesian framework to combine, or aggregate, a hierarchy of multiple binary classifiers in a principled manner, and consequently improves performance over the hierarchy as a whole. Furthermore, such an approach allows for an arbitrarily complex hierarchy, and does not suffer from classes that are too broad or too refined. Experiments on the MIREX 2005 symbolic genre classification dataset show that our Bayesian Aggregation algorithm provides significant improvement over independent classifiers, and demonstrates superior performance compared to previous work. Our method also improves similarity search by ranking songs by similarity of hierarchical predictions to those of a query song.;"Christopher DeCoro, Princeton University, USA, education;Zafer Barutcuoglu, Princeton University, USA, education;Rebecca Fiebrink, Princeton University, USA, education";Princeton University, Princeton University, Princeton University;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-3.2161534;33.178024

Our goal is to automatically detect musical boundaries using temporally-local audio features. We develop a set of difference features that indicate when there are changes in perceptual aspects (e.g., timbre, harmony, melody, rhythm) of the music. We show that many individual difference features are useful for detecting boundaries. By combining these features and formulating the problem as a supervised learning problem, we can further improve performance. This is an alternative to previous work on music segmentation which has focused on unsupervised approaches based on notions of self-similarity computed over an entire song. We evaluate performance using a publicly available data set of 100 copyright-cleared pop/rock songs, each of which has been segmented by a human expert.;"Douglas Turnbull, University of California, San Diego, USA, education;Gert Lanckriet, University of California, San Diego, USA, education;Elias Pampalk, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility";University of California San Diego, University of California San Diego, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;education, education, facility, facility;USA, USA, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;6.521767;18.77029

Mood as a music access feature, however, is not well understood in that the terms used to describe it are not standardized and their application can be highly idiosyncratic. To better understand how we might develop methods for comprehensively developing and formally evaluating useful automated mood access techniques, we explore the relationships that mood has with genre, artist and usage metadata. Statistical analyses of term interactions across three metadata collections (AllMusicGuide.com, epinions.com and Last.fm) reveal important consistencies within the genre-mood and artist-mood relationships. These consistencies lead us to recommend a cluster-based approach that overcomes specific term-related problems by creating a relatively small set of data-derived “mood spaces” that could form the ground-truth for a proposed MIREX “Automated Mood Classification” task.;"Xiao Hu, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA, education;J.

This paper offers an overview of the set of features, related, among others, to timbre, tonality, rhythm or form, that can be extracted with the MIRtoolbox. One particular analysis is provided as an example. The toolbox also includes functions for statistical analysis, segmentation and clustering. Particular attention has been paid to the design of a syntax that offers both simplicity of use and transparent adaptiveness to a multiplicity of possible input types. Each feature extraction method can accept as argument an audio ﬁle, or any preliminary result from intermediary stages of the chain of operations. Also the same syntax can be used for analyses of single audio ﬁles, batches of ﬁles, series of audio segments, multi-channel signals, etc. For that purpose, the data and methods of the toolbox are organised in an object-oriented architecture.;"Olivier Lartillot, University of Jyväskylä, FIN, education;Petri Toiviainen, University of Jyväskylä, FIN, education";University of Jyväskylä, University of Jyväskylä;education, education;FIN, FIN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;10.932941;23.07634

The methodology is based on the automatic segmentation of audio recordings, exploiting a technique that has been proposed for text segmentation. The segmentation is followed by the automatic extraction of a set of relevant audio features from each segment. Identiﬁcation is then carried out using an application of hidden Markov models.

The method segments a piece into uniform time slices, and determines the most likely key in each slice. It then generates the visualization by dynamically showing the sequence of keys as translucent, growing discs on the two-dimensional plane. The frequency of a key is indicated by the size of its colored disc. Each color and position corresponds to a key, and related keys are shown in proximity with related colors. The visual result effectively presents the changing distribution of the keys employed. The proposed visualization is an improvement over more basic charting methods, such as histograms, and it maintains standards of information design in the form of added dimensionality, color, and animation. We show that the visualization is invariant under music transformations that preserve the piece’s identity. We conclude by illustrating how this method may be used to visually distinguish between tonal progression and distribution patterns in western classical versus Armenian folk music.;"Arpi Mardirossian, University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering, USA, education;Elaine Chew, University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering, USA, education";University of Southern California, University of Southern California;education, education;USA, USA;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-37.114166;1.6744757

We test the two models on phrase extraction from performances of entire classical romantic pieces namely, Chopin’s Preludes Nos. 1 and 7. The algorithms determined 21 of the 26 phrase boundaries correctly from Arthur Rubinstein’s and Evgeny Kissin’s performances. We observe that not all tempo slowdowns signify a boundary (some are agogic accents), and multiple levels of phrasing strategies should be considered for detailed interpretation analyses.;"Ching-Hua Chuan, University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering, USA, education;Elaine Chew, University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering, USA, education";University of Southern California, University of Southern California;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;48.410297;15.202865

The system is iterative: it uses classification decisions it made on some classification problems as new features for new, harder problems; and hybrid: it uses a signal classifier based on timbre similarity to bootstrap symbolic inference with decision trees.

It also includes a description of a note onset, offset and amplitude retrieval procedure based on that technique. Compared with the previous NNMA approaches, specific initialization of the basis matrix is employed – the basis matrix is initialized with zeros everywhere but at positions corresponding to harmonic frequencies of consequent notes of the equal temperament scale. This results in the basis containing nothing but harmonically structured vectors, even after the learning process, and the activity matrix’s rows containing peaks corresponding to note onset times and amplitudes. Furthermore, additional penalties of mutual uncorrelation and sparseness of rows are placed upon the activity matrix. The proposed method is able to uncover the underlying musical structure better than the previous NNMA approaches and makes the note detection process very straightforward.;"Stanisław A.

In this paper we develop methods and tools that support researchers in ﬁnding melodies in a database that belong to the same variant group as a set of given melodies. The basic approach is to derive from the pitches of the known variants per onset a weighted pitch distribution, which quantiﬁes pitch stability. We allow for partial matching and AND and OR queries. Technically we do so by deﬁning a distance measure between weighted pitch distribution sequences. It is based on two applications of the Earth Mover’s Distance, which is a distribution distance. We set up a distance framework and discuss musically meaningful parameterizations for two tasks: a) Study the inner-group distances between the group as a whole and single members of the group. b) Use the group’s weighted pitch distribution sequence to query for variant melodies. The ﬁrst experimental results seem very promising: a) The inner-group distances correlate to expert assigned subgroups. b) For variant retrieval our method works better than last year’s MIREX winner.;"Jörg Garbers, Utrecht University, NLD, education;Peter van Kranenburg, Utrecht University, NLD, education;Anja Volk, Utrecht University, NLD, education;Frans Wiering, Utrecht University, NLD, education;Remco C.

It basically enables the user to ﬁnd (groups of) similar melodies, thus facilitating musicological research of many kinds. We present a graph spectral approach, new to the music retrieval ﬁeld, in which melodies are represented as graphs, based on the intervals between the notes they are composed of. These graphs are then indexed into a database using their laplacian spectra as a feature vector. This laplacian spectrum is known to be very informative about the graph, and is therefore a good representative of the original melody. Consequently, range searching around the query spectrum returns similar melodies. We present an experimental evaluation of this approach, together with a comparison with two known retrieval techniques. On our test corpus, a subset of a well documented and annotated collection of Dutch folk songs, this evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the overall approach.;"Alberto Pinto, Universiteit Utrecht, NLD, education, Università degli Studi di Milano, ITA, education;Reinier H. van Leuken, Universiteit Utrecht, NLD, education;M.

Much of the previous work on query-by-example (QBE) or music similarity uses detailed analysis of the object’s content. This is difﬁcult and it is often impossible to capture how consumers react to the music. We argue that a large collection of user’s preferences is more accurate, at least in comparison to our benchmark system, at ﬁnding similar songs. We describe an algorithm based the song’s rating data, and show how this approach works by measuring its performance using an objective metric based on whether the same artist performed both songs. Our similarity results are based on 1.5 million musical judgments by 380,000 users. We test our system by generating playlists using a content-based system, our rating-based system, and a random list of songs.

First, the extraction algorithms are very demanding in terms of memory and computation resources. Second, copyright laws prevent the audio files to be shared among computers, limiting the use of existing distributed computation frameworks and reducing the transparency of the methods evaluation process. The iSound Music Warehouse (iSoundMW), presented in this paper, is a framework to collect and query high-level audio features. It performs the feature extraction in a two-step process that allows distributed computations while respecting copyright laws. Using public computers, the extraction can be performed on large scale music collections. However, to be truly valuable, data management tools to search among the extracted features are needed. The iSoundMW enables similarity search among the collected high-level features and demonstrates its flexibility and efficiency by using a weighted combination of high-level features and constraints while showing good search performance results.;"Franc¸ois Deli`ege, Aalborg University, DNK, education;Bee Yong Chua, Aalborg University, DNK, education;Torben Bach Pedersen, Aalborg University, DNK, education";Aalborg University, Aalborg University, Aalborg University;education, education, education;DNK, DNK, DNK;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;13.533823;21.619816

Current music recommenders which employ social tagging to improve the music recommendation, fail to always provide appropriate item recommendations, because: (i) users may have different interests for a musical item, and (ii) musical items may have multiple facets.

Inspired by a model of auditory cortical processing, multiscale spectro-temporal modulation features are extracted. Such spectro-temporal modulation features have been successfully used in various content-based audio classiﬁcation tasks recently, but not yet in music genre classiﬁcation. Each recording is represented by a third-order feature tensor generated by the auditory model. Thus, the ensemble of recordings is represented by a fourth-order data tensor created by stacking the third-order feature tensors associated to the recordings. To handle large data tensors and derive compact feature vectors suitable for classiﬁcation, three multilinear subspace techniques are examined, namely the Non-Negative Tensor Factorization (NTF), the High-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), and the Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). Classiﬁcation is performed by a Support Vector Machine. Stratiﬁed cross-validation tests on the GTZAN dataset and the ISMIR 2004 Genre one demonstrate the advantages of NTF and HOSVD versus MPCA.

"Ricardo Scholz;Geber Ramalho";COCHONUT: Recognizing Complex Chords from MIDI Guitar Sequences.;2008;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416986;Chord recognition from symbolic data is a complex task, due to its strong context dependency and the large number of possible combinations of the intervals which the chords are made of, specially when dealing with dissonances, such as 7ths, 9ths, 13ths and suspended chords. None of the current approaches deal with such complexity. Most of them consider only simple chord patterns, in the best cases, including sevenths. In addition, when considering symbolic data captured from a MIDI guitar, we need to deal with non quantized and noisy data, which increases the difficulty of the task. The current symbolic approaches deal only with quantized data, with no automatic technique to reduce noise. This paper proposes a new approach to recognize chords, from symbolic MIDI guitar data, called COCHONUT (Complex Chords Nutting). The system uses contextual harmonic information to solve ambiguous cases, integrated with other techniques, such as decision theory, optimization, pattern matching and rule-based recognition. The results are encouraging and provide strong indications that the use of harmonic contextual information, integrated with other techniques, can actually improve the results currently found in literature.;"Ricardo Scholz, Federal University of Pernambuco, BRA, education;Geber Ramalho, Federal University of Pernambuco, BRA, education";Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,Universidade Federal de Pernambuco;education, education;BRA, BRA;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;27.319912;-51.49379
Hanna M. Lukashevich;Towards Quantitative Measures of Evaluating Song Segmentation.;2008;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417623;Automatic music structure analysis or song segmentation has immediate applications in the ﬁeld of music information retrieval. Among these applications is active music navigation, automatic generation of audio summaries, automatic music analysis, etc. One of the important aspects of a song segmentation task is its evaluation. Commonly, that implies comparing the automatically estimated segmentation with a ground-truth, annotated by human experts. The automatic evaluation of segmentation algorithms provides the quantitative measure that reﬂects how well the estimated segmentation matches the annotated ground-truth. In this paper we present a novel evaluation measure based on informationtheoretic conditional entropy. The principal advantage of the proposed approach lies in the applied normalization, which enables the comparison of the automatic evaluation results, obtained for songs with a different amount of states. We discuss and compare the evaluation scores commonly used for evaluating song segmentation at present. We provide several examples illustrating the behavior of different evaluation measures and weigh the beneﬁts of the presented metric against the others.;Hanna Lukashevich, Fraunhofer IDMT, Germany, facility;Fraunhofer IDMT;facility;DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;6.387565;14.279076
"Mark Godfrey;Parag Chordia";Hubs and Homogeneity: Improving Content-Based Music Modeling.;2008;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415154;We explore the origins of hubs in timbre-based song modeling in the context of content-based music recommendation and propose several remedies. Specifically, we find that a process of model homogenization, in which certain components of a mixture model are systematically removed, improves performance as measured against several ground-truth similarity metrics. Extending the work of Aucouturier, we introduce several new methods of homogenization. On a subset of the uspop data set, model homogenization improves artist R-precision by a maximum of 3.5% and agreement to user collection co-occurrence data by 7.4%. We also explore differences in the effectiveness of the various homogenization methods for hub reduction. Further, we extend the modeling of frame-based MFCC features by using a kernel density estimation approach to non-parametric modeling. We find that such an approach significantly reduces the number of hubs (by 2.6% of the dataset) while improving agreement to ground-truth by 5% and slightly improving artist R-precision as compared with the standard parametric model.;"Mark T.

"Parag Chordia;Mark Godfrey;Alex Rae";Extending Content-Based Recommendation: The Case of Indian Classical Music.;2008;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415132;We describe a series of experiments that attempt to create a content-based similarity model suitable for making recommendations about North Indian classical music (NICM). We introduce a dataset (nicm2008) consisting of 897 tracks of NICM along with substantial ground-truth annotations, including artist, predominant instrument, tonic pitch, raag, and parent scale (thaat). Using a timbre-based similarity model derived from short-time MFCCs we ﬁnd that artist R-precision is 32.69% and that the predominant instrument is correctly classified 90.30% of the time. Consistent with previous work, we find that certain tracks (“hubs”) appear falsely similar to many other tracks. We find that this problem can be attenuated by model homogenization. We also introduce the use of pitch-class distribution (PCD) features to measure melodic similarity. Its effectiveness is evaluated by raag R-precision (16.97%), thaat classification accuracy (75.83%), and comparison to reference similarity metrics. We propose that a hybrid timbral-melodic similarity model may be effective for Indian classical music recommendation. Further, this work suggests that “hubs” are a general features of such similarity modeling that may be partially alleviated by model homogenization;"Parag Chordia, Georgia Tech, USA, education;Mark Godfrey, Georgia Tech, USA, education;Alex Rae, Georgia Tech, USA, education";Georgia Institute of Technology,Georgia Institute of Technology,Georgia Institute of Technology;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-42.48387;36.989807

Nicolas Scaringella;Timbre and Rhythmic TRAP-TANDEM Features for Music Information Retrieval.;2008;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1418113;The enormous growth of digital music databases has led to a comparable growth in the need for methods that help users organize and access such information. One area in particular that has seen much recent research activity is the use of automated techniques to describe audio content and to allow for its identiﬁcation, browsing and retrieval. Conventional approaches to music content description rely on features characterizing the shape of the signal spectrum in relatively short-term frames. In the context of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Hermansky [7] described an interesting alternative to short-term spectrum features, the TRAP-TANDEM approach which uses long-term band-limited features trained in a supervised fashion. We adapt this idea to the speciﬁc case of music signals and propose a generic system for the description of temporal patterns. The same system with different settings is able to extract features describing either timbre or rhythmic content.

However, few systems which connect exercises with music selection have been developed. We propose a system that automatically selects music suitable for user’s running exercises. Although many parameters can be taken into account, as a first step we focus on runner’s step frequency. This system selects music with tempo suitable for runner’s step frequency and when runner’s step frequency changes, it executes another music selection. The system consists of three modules: step frequency estimation, music selection, and music playing. In the first module, runner’s step frequency is estimated from data derived from an acceleration sensor. In the second module, appropriate music is selected based on the estimated step frequency. In the third module, the selected music is played until runner’s step frequency changes. In the experiment, subjects ran on a running machine at different paces listening to the music selected by the proposed system.

To change the volume, all instrument parts are separated from the input sound mixture using the corresponding standard MIDI ﬁle. For the separation, we used an integrated tone (timbre) model consisting of harmonic and inharmonic models that are initialized with template sounds recorded from a MIDI sound generator. The remaining but critical problem here is to deal with various performance styles and instrument bodies that are not given in the template sounds. To solve this problem, we train probabilistic distributions of timbre features by using various sounds.

Some of these measures are mathematically inspired, some were designed to measure syncopation, some were intended to predict various measures of human performance, some are based on constructs from music theory, such as Pressing’s cognitive complexity, and others are direct measures of different aspects of human performance, such as perceptual complexity, meter complexity, and performance complexity. In each data set the rhythms are ranked either according to increasing complexity using the judgements of human subjects, or using calculations with the computational models. Spearman rank correlation coefﬁcients are computed between all pairs of rhythm rankings. Then phylogenetic trees are used to visualize and cluster the correlation coefﬁcients. Among the many conclusions evident from the results, there are several observations common to all three data sets that are worthy of note. The syncopation measures form a tight cluster far from other clusters. The human performance measures fall in the same cluster as the syncopation measures. The complexity measures based on statistical properties of the inter-onset-interval histograms are poor predictors of syncopation or human performance complexity. Finally, this research suggests several open problems.;"Eric Thul, McGill University, CAN, education;Godfried T.

Even when such bleedthrough does not pose problems for human perception, it can inhibit the performance of optical music recognition (OMR). One way to reduce the amount of bleedthrough is to take into account what is printed on the reverse of the page. In order to do so, the reverse of the page must be registered to match the front of the page on a pixel-by-pixel basis. This paper describes our approach to registering scanned early music scores as well as our modiﬁcations to two robust binarization approaches to take into account bleedthrough and the information available from the registration process. We determined that although the information from registration itself often makes little difference in recognition performance, other modiﬁcations to binarization algorithms for correcting bleedthrough can yield dramatic increases in OMR results.;"John Ashley Burgoyne, Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music and Media Technology, Schulich School of Music of McGill University, Montréal (Qu´ebec) Canada, education;Johanna Devaney, Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music and Media Technology, Schulich School of Music of McGill University, Montréal (Qu´ebec) Canada, education;Laurent Pugin, Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music and Media Technology, Schulich School of Music of McGill University, Montréal (Qu´ebec) Canada, education;Ichiro Fujinaga, Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music and Media Technology, Schulich School of Music of McGill University, Montréal (Qu´ebec) Canada, education";McGill University,McGill University,McGill University,McGill University;education, education, education, education;CAN, CAN, CAN, CAN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-20.45399;-26.796013

"Zhiyao Duan;Lie Lu;Changshui Zhang";Collective Annotation of Music from Multiple Semantic Categories.;2008;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416694;Music semantic annotation aims to automatically annotate a music signal with a set of semantic labels (words or tags). Existing methods on music semantic annotation usually take it as a multi-label binary classiﬁcation problem, and model each semantic label individually while ignoring their relationships. However, there are usually strong correlations between some labels. Intuitively, investigating this correlation can be helpful to improve the overall annotation performance. In this paper, we report our attempts to collective music semantic annotation, which not only builds a model for each semantic label, but also builds models for the pairs of labels that have significant correlations. Two methods are exploited in this paper, one based on a generative model (Gaussian Mixture Model), and another based on a discriminative model (Conditional Random Field).

These thumbnails can help users immediately guess the musical contents of audio signals without trial listening. This method is consistent in ways that optimize thumbnails according to the characteristics of a target music collection. This means the appropriateness of transformation should be defined to eliminate ad hoc transformation rules. In this paper, we introduce three top-down criteria to improve memorability of thumbnails (generate gradations), deliver information more completely, and distinguish thumbnails more clearly. These criteria are mathematically implemented as minimization of brightness differences of adjacent pixels and maximization of brightness variances within and between thumbnails. The optimized parameters of a modified linear mapping model we assumed are obtained by minimizing a unified cost function based on the three criteria with a steepest descent method. Experimental results indicate that generated thumbnails can provide users with useful hints as to the musical contents of musical pieces.;"Kazuyoshi Yoshii, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;facility, facility;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-39.56756;-1.428298

We focus here on sound source recognition in music audio mixtures. Many researchers have made progress by using isolated training examples or very strongly labeled training data. We consider an alternative approach: the learner is presented with a variety of weaky-labeled mixtures. Positive examples include the target instrument at some point in a mixture of sounds, and negative examples are mixtures that do not contain the target. We show that it not only possible to learn from weakly-labeled mixtures of instruments, but that it works significantly better (78% correct labeling compared to 55%) than learning from isolated examples when the task is identification of an instrument in novel mixtures.;"David Little, Northwestern University, USA, education;Bryan Pardo, Northwestern University, USA, education";Northwestern University, Northwestern University;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;33.080845;-28.917019

Comparing the query melody to every item in a large database is prohibitively slow.

We describe a simple melody metric that is customizable using a small number of example queries. This metric allows use of a generalized vantage point tree to organize the database. We show on a standard melodic database that the general vantage tree approach achieves superior search results for query-by-humming compared to an existing vantage point tree method.

The method employs the self-similarity matrix of an audio signal to represent a key-invariant structure of musical audio. And, we use dynamic programming (DP) matching of self-similarity matrices to deal with time variations. However, conventional DP-based sequence matching methods cannot be directly applied for self-similarity matrices because they cannot treat gaps independently of other time frames. We resolve this problem by introducing “matched element indices,” which reflect the history of matching, to a DP-based sequence matching method. We performed experiments using musical audio signals. The results indicate that the proposed method improves the detection accuracy in comparison to that that obtained by two conventional methods, namely, DP matching with chroma-based vector rotations and a simple matching of self-similarity feature vectors.;"Tomonori Izumitani, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, JPN, company;Kunio Kashino, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, JPN, company";NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Communication Science Laboratories;company, company;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-4.300437;10.2673

In this paper we present a new algorithm for sinusoidal parameter estimation of overlapping harmonics for pitched instruments. Our algorithm is based on the assumptions that harmonics of the same source have correlated amplitude envelopes and the phase change of harmonics can be accurately predicted from an instrument’s pitch. We exploit these two assumptions in a least-squares estimation framework to resolve overlapping harmonics. This new algorithm is incorporated into a separation system and quantitative evaluation shows that the resulting system performs signiﬁcantly better than an existing monaural music separation system for mixtures of harmonic instruments.;"John Woodruff, The Ohio State University, USA, education;Yipeng Li, The Ohio State University, USA, education;DeLiang Wang, The Ohio State University, USA, education";Ohio State University, Ohio State University, Ohio State University;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;43.748337;-16.079777

Based on this structure, we compute timbral similarity between recorded songs. The HDP is a nonparametric Bayesian model. Like the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), it represents each song as a mixture of some number of multivariate Gaussian distributions However, the number of mixture components is not ﬁxed in the HDP, but is determined as part of the posterior inference process. Moreover, in the HDP the same set of Gaussians is used to model all songs, with only the mixture weights varying from song to song. We compute the similarity of songs based on these weights, which is faster than previous approaches that compare single Gaussian distributions directly. Experimental results on a genre-based retrieval task illustrate that our HDPbased method is both faster and produces better retrieval quality than such previous approaches.;"Matthew Hoffman, Princeton University, USA, education;David Blei, Princeton University, USA, education;Perry Cook, Princeton University, USA, education";Princeton University, Princeton University, Princeton University;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-11.032873;5.07761

It generates a total over several experiments of 12,450 harmony rules characterising and differentiating the Real Book (jazz) songs and the Beatles’ (pop) music.

Many past algorithms for chord labelling are based on chromagrams, but distribution of energy in chroma frames is not well understood. Furthermore, non-chord notes complicate chord estimation. We present a new approach which uses as a basis a relatively simple chroma model to represent short-time sonorities derived from melody range and bass range chromagrams. A chord is then modelled as a mixture of these sonorities, or subchords. We prove the practicability of the model by implementing a hidden Markov model (HMM) for chord labelling, in which we use the discrete subchord features as observations. We model gamma-distributed chord durations by duplicate states in the HMM, a technique that had not been applied to chord labelling. We test the algorithm by ﬁve-fold cross-validation on a set of 175 hand-labelled songs performed by the Beatles. Accuracy ﬁgures compare very well with other state of the art approaches.

"Meinard Müller;Sebastian Ewert";Joint Structure Analysis with Applications to Music Annotation and Synchronization.;2008;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415236;The general goal of music synchronization is to automatically align different versions and interpretations related to a given musical work. In computing such alignments, recent approaches assume that the versions to be aligned correspond to each other with respect to their overall global structure. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption is often violated. For example, for a popular song there often exist various structurally different album, radio, or extended versions. Or, in classical music, different recordings of the same piece may exhibit omissions of repetitions or significant differences in parts such as solo cadenzas. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for automatically detecting structural similarities and differences between two given versions of the same piece. The key idea is to perform a single structural analysis for both versions simultaneously instead of performing two separate analyses for each of the two versions. Such a joint structure analysis reveals the repetitions within and across the two versions. As a further contribution, we show how this information can be used for deriving musically meaningful partial alignments and annotations in the presence of structural variations.;"Meinard Müller, Saarland University, DEU, education; MPI Informatik, DEU, facility;Sebastian Ewert, Bonn University, DEU, education";Saarland University, University of Bonn;education, education;DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-16.115883;-32.308067

The system uses three types of acoustic features: mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, chroma, and rhythmogram. An analysed piece is first subdivided into a large amount of potential segments. The distance between each two segments is then calculated and the value is transformed to a probability that the two segments are occurrences of a same musical part. Different features are combined in the probability space and are used to define a fitness measure for a candidate structure description. Musicological knowledge of the temporal dependencies between the parts is integrated into the fitness measure. A novel search algorithm is presented for finding the description that maximises the fitness measure. The system is evaluated with a data set of 557 manually annotated popular music pieces. The results suggest that integrating the musicological model to the fitness measure leads to a more reliable labelling of the parts than performing the labelling as a post-processing step.;"Jouni Paulus, Tampere University of Technology, Finland, education;Anssi Klapuri, Tampere University of Technology, Finland, education";Tampere University of Technology, Tampere University of Technology;education, education;FIN, FIN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-0.018844228;6.256078

A newly built labeled database covering 147 popular songs is announced. It is designed for classifying signals from 1sec time windows. Features are selected for this particular task, in order to capture both the temporal correlations and the dependencies among the feature dimensions. We systematically study the performance of a set of classiﬁers, including linear regression, generalized linear model, Gaussian mixture model, reduced kernel orthonormalized partial least squares and K-means on cross-validated training and test setup. The database is divided in two different ways: with/without artist overlap between training and test sets, so as to study the so called ‘artist effect’. The performance and results are analyzed in depth: from error rates to sample-to-sample error correlation. A voting scheme is proposed to enhance the performance under certain conditions.;"Ling Feng, Technical University of Denmark, DNK, education;Andreas Brinch Nielsen, Technical University of Denmark, DNK, education;Lars Kai Hansen, Technical University of Denmark, DNK, education";Technical University of Denmark, Technical University of Denmark, Technical University of Denmark;education, education, education;DNK, DNK, DNK;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;31.90137;-2.199331

The case of the automatic transcription of piano music is taken as the target application and two subjective tests are designed. The main test aims at understanding how human subjects rank typical transcription errors such as note insertion, deletion or replacement, note doubling, incorrect note onset or duration, and so forth. The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) analysis framework is used and the results show that pitch errors are more clearly perceived than incorrect loudness estimations or temporal deviations from the original recording. A second test presents a first attempt to include this information in more perceptually motivated measures for evaluating transcription systems.;"Adrien DANIEL, TELECOM ParisTech (ENST), CNRS LTCI, FRA, education;Valentin EMIYA, TELECOM ParisTech (ENST), CNRS LTCI, FRA, education;Bertrand DAVID, TELECOM ParisTech (ENST), CNRS LTCI, FRA, education";Telecom ParisTech,Telecom ParisTech,Telecom ParisTech;education, education, education;FRA, FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;24.112381;22.396027

In many commercial applications, the problem of finding those snippets is addressed by having humans seect the most salient parts of the song or by extracting a few seconds from the song's introduction. Research in the automatic creating of music summaries has focused mainly on the extraction of one or more highly repetitive phrases to represent the whole song. This paper explores whether the composition of multiple characteristic phrases that are selected to be highly dissimilar to one another will increase the summary's effectiveness. This paper presents three variations of this multi-phrase music summarization approach and a human-centered evaluation comparing these algorithms. Results showed that the resulting muilti-phrase summaries performed well in describing the songs. People preferred the multi-phrase summaries over presentations of the introductions of the songs. ;"Konstantinos A. Meintanis, Texas A&M University, education, USA;Frank M.

This paper proposes noise-robust musical beat tracking by using a robot-embedded microphone, and describes its application to a robot singer with music recognition. The proposed beat tracking introduces two key techniques, that is, spectro-temporal pattern matching and echo cancellation. The former realizes robust tempo estimation with a shorter window length, thus, it can quickly adapt to tempo changes. The latter is effective to cancel self periodic noises such as stepping, scatting, and singing. We constructed a robot singer based on the proposed beat tracking for Honda ASIMO. The robot detects a musical beat with its own microphone in a noisy environment. It tries to recognize music based on the detected musical beat. When it successfully recognizes music, it sings while stepping according to the beat. Otherwise, it performs scatting instead of singing because the lyrics are unavailable. Experimental results showed fast adaptation to tempo changes and high robustness in beat tracking even when stepping, scatting and singing.;"Kazumasa Murata, Tokyo Institute of Technology, JPN, education;Kazuhiro Nakadai, Tokyo Institute of Technology, JPN, education, Honda Research Institute Japan Co., Ltd., JPN, company;Kazuyoshi Yoshii, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Ryu Takeda, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Toyotaka Torii, Honda Research Institute Japan Co., Ltd., JPN, company;Hiroshi G.

This paper presents a novel unsupervised approach for clustering music recordings by their keys. Based on chroma-based features extracted from acoustic signals, an inter-recording distance metric which characterizes diversity of pitch distribution together with harmonic center of music pieces, is introduced to measure dissimilarities among musical features. Then, recordings are divided into categories via unsupervised clustering, where the best number of clusters can be determined automatically by minimizing estimated Rand Index. Any existing technique for key detection can then be employed to identify key assignment for each cluster. Empirical evaluation on a dataset of 91 pop songs illustrates an average cluster purity of 57.3% and a Rand Index of close to 50%, thus highlighting the possibility of integration with existing key identification techniques to improve accuracy, based on strong cross-correlation data available from this framework for input dataset.;"Yuxiang Liu, Tsinghua University, CHN, education;Ye Wang, National University of Singapore, SGP, education;Arun Shenoy, ;Wei-Ho Tsai, National Taipei University of Technology, TWN, education;Lianhong Cai, Tsinghua University, CHN, education";Tsinghua University, National University of Singapore, National Taipei University of Technology, National Taipei University of Technology, Tsinghua University;education, education, education, education, education;CHN, SGP, TWN, TWN, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;2.1582274;14.826746

To this end, both the scanned images as well as the audio recordings are ﬁrst transformed into a common feature representation using optical music recognition (OMR) and methods from digital signal processing, respectively. Based on this common representation, a direct comparison of the two different types of data is facilitated. This allows for a search of scan-based queries in the audio collection. We report on systematic experiments conducted on the corpus of Beethoven’s piano sonatas showing that our mapping procedure works with high precision across the two types of music data in the case that there are no severe OMR errors.

A dozen of descriptors have been designed, some of them dedicated to low-level characterizations of the onset detection curve, whereas the major part concentrates on descriptions of the periodicities developed throughout the temporal evolution of music. A high number of variants have been derived from the systematic exploration of alternative methods proposed in the literature on onset detection curve estimation. To evaluate the pulse clarity model and select the best predictors, 25 participants have rated the pulse clarity of one hundred excerpts from movie soundtracks.

We describe a number of the algorithms by which IVI forms, stores, and updates its hierarchy of notes, along with details of the Ursatz-ﬁnding algorithm. We illustrate IVI’s functionality on an excerpt from a Schubert piano composition, and also discuss the issues of subproblem interactions and the multiple parsings problem.;"Phillip B.

"Mitsunori Ogihara;Tao Li";N-Gram Chord Profiles for Composer Style Representation.;2008;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415956;This paper studies the problem of using weighted N-grams of chord sequences to construct the proﬁle of a composer. The N-gram proﬁle of a chord sequence is the collection of all N-grams appearing in a sequence where each N-gram is given a weight proportional to its beat count. The N-gram proﬁle of a collection of chord sequences is the simple average of the N-gram proﬁle of all the chord sequences in the collection. Similarity of two composers is measured by the cosine of their respective proﬁles, which has a value in the range [0, 1]. Using the cosine-based similarity, a group of composers is clustered into a hierarchy, which appears to be explicable. Also, the composition style can be identiﬁed using N-gram signatures.;"Mitsunori Ogihara, University of Miami, USA, education;Tao Li, Florida International University, USA, education";University of Miami, Florida International University;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;21.71769;-53.138702

It can be considered an extension of ﬁngerprinting techniques because the identiﬁcation is carried out also when the query is a different performance of the work stored in the database, possibly played by different instruments and with background noise. The proposed methodology integrates an already existing approach based on hidden Markov models with an additional component that aims at improving scalability. The general idea is to carry out a clustering of the collection to highlight a limited number of candidates to be used for the HMM-based identiﬁcation. Clustering is computed using the chroma features of the music works, hashed in a single value and retrieved using a bag of terms approach. Evaluation results are provided to show the validity of the combined approaches.;"Riccardo Miotto, University of Padova, ITA, education;Nicola Orio, University of Padova, ITA, education";University of Padova, University of Padova;education, education;ITA, ITA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;4.634824;24.03585
"Xinglin Zhang;David Gerhard";Chord Recognition using Instrument Voicing Constraints.;2008;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1414826;This paper presents a technique of disambiguation for chord recognition based on a-priori knowledge of probabilities of chord voicings in the speciﬁc musical medium. The main motivating example is guitar chord recognition, where the physical layout and structure of the instrument, along with human physical and temporal constraints, make certain chord voicings and chord sequences more likely than others. Pitch classes are ﬁrst extracted using the Pitch Class Proﬁle (PCP) technique, and chords are then recognized using Artiﬁcial Neural Networks. The chord information is then analyzed using an array of voicing vectors (VV) indicating likelihood for chord voicings based on constraints of the instrument. Chord sequence analysis is used to reinforce accuracy of in-dividual chord estimations. The speciﬁc notes of the chord are then inferred by combining the chord information and the best estimated voicing of the chord.;"Xinglin Zhang, University of Regina, CAN, education;David Gerhard, University of Regina, CAN, education";University of Regina, University of Regina;education, education;CAN, CAN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;26.925013;-55.13722

The evaluation of automated accompaniment systems, and the degree to which they emulate a style, has been based primarily on subjective opinion. To quantify style similarity between machine-generated and original accompaniments, we propose two types of measures: one based on transformations in the neo-Riemannian chord space, and another based on the distribution of melody-chord intervals. The first set of experiments demonstrate the methods on an automatic style-specific accompaniment (ASSA) system. They test the effect of training data choice on style emulation effectiveness, and challenge the assumption that more data is better. The second set of experiments compare the output of the ASSA system with those of a rule-based system, and random chord generator.

Melody prediction is one of the most difficult problems in musical information retrieval because composers and players may or may not create melodies that conform to our expectation. The development of a melody expectation method is thus important for building a system that supports musical novices because melody expectation is one of the most basic skills for a musician. Unlike most previous prediction methods, which use statistical learning, our method evaluates the appropriateness of each candidate note from the view point of musical theory. In particular, it uses the concept of melody stability based on the generative theory of tonal music (GTTM) and the tonal pitch space (TPS) to evaluate the appropriateness of the melody. It can thus predict the candidate next notes not only from the surface structure of the melody but also from the deeper structure of the melody acquired by GTTM and TPS analysis. Experimental results showed that the method can evaluate the appropriateness of the melody sufficiently well.;"Masatoshi Hamanaka, University of Tsukuba, JPN, education;Keiji Hirata, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, JPN, company;Satoshi Tojo, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, JPN, education";University of Tsukuba, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology;education, company, facility;JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-7.5987782;-18.381403

The audible part of a piece of music, its sound, does for sure contribute, but is only one aspect to be taken into account. Cultural information inﬂuences how we experience music, as does the songs’ text and its sound. Next to symbolic and audio based music information retrieval, which focus on the sound of music, song lyrics, may thus be used to improve classiﬁcation or similarity ranking of music. Song lyrics exhibit speciﬁc properties different from traditional text documents – many lyrics are for example composed in rhyming verses, and may have different frequencies for certain parts-of-speech when compared to other text documents. Further, lyrics may use ‘slang’ language or differ greatly in the length and complexity of the language used, which can be measured by some statistical features such as word / verse length, and the amount of repetative text.

Several algorithms dealing with the extraction of rhythmic information from music signals were proposed in literature. Most of them derive a so-called beat histogram by auto-correlating a representation of the temporal envelope of the music signal. To circumvent the problem of tempo dependency, post-processing via higher-order statistics has been reported. Tests concluded, that these statistics are still tempo dependent to a certain extent. This paper describes a method, which transforms the original auto-correlated envelope into a tempo-independent rhythmic feature vector by multiplying the lag-axis with a stretch factor.

In much of this research, it is convenient to think of beats as occuring at precise time points. However, anyone who has attempted to label beats by hand soon realizes that precise annotation of music audio is not possible. A common method of beat annotation is simply to tap along with audio and record the tap times. This raises the question: How accurate are the taps? It may seem that an answer to this question would require knowledge of “true” beat times. However, tap times can be characterized as a random distribution around true beat times. Multiple independent taps can be used to estimate not only the location of the true beat time, but also the statistical distribution of measured tap times around the true beat time. Thus, without knowledge of true beat times, and without even requiring the existence of precise beat times, we can estimate the uncertainty of tap times. This characterization of tapping can be useful for estimating tempo variation and evaluating alternative annotation methods.;"Roger B.

Özgür Izmirli;Tonal-Atonal Classification of Music Audio Using Diffusion Maps.;2009;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416936;In this paper we look at the problem of classifying music audio as tonal or atonal by learning a low-dimensional structure representing tonal relationships among keys. We use a training set composed of tonal pieces which includes all major and minor keys. A kernel eigenmap based method is used for structure learning and discovery. Specifically, a Diffusion Maps (DM) framework is used and its parameter tuning is discussed. Since these methods do not scale well with increasing data size, it becomes infeasible to use these methods in online applications. In order to facilitate on-line classification an out-of-sample extension to the DM framework is given. The learned structure of tonal relationships is presented and a simple scheme for classification of tonal-atonal pieces is proposed. Evaluation results show that the method is able to perform at an accuracy above 90% with the current data set.;Özgür İzmirli, Connecticut College, USA, education;Connecticut College;education;USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;4.882858;25.810799

Widespread performance evaluations on common data sets, such as the annual MIREX events, have also been instrumental in advancing the field. These endeavors incur a large computational cost, and could potentially benefit greatly from more rapid calculation of acoustic features. Traditional, cluster-based solutions for large-scale feature extraction are expensive and spaceand power-inefficient. Using the massively parallel architecture of the field programmable gate array (FPGA), it is possible to design an application specific chip rivaling the speed of a cluster for large-scale acoustic feature computation at lower cost. Recent advances in development tools, such as the Xilinx Blockset in Simulink, allow rapid prototyping, simulation, and implementation on actual hardware. Such devices also show potential for the implementation of MIR systems on embedded devices such as cell phones and PDAs where hardware acceleration would be an absolute necessity. We present a prototype library for acoustic feature calculation for implementation on Xilinx FPGA hardware. Furthermore, using a genre classification task we compare the performance of simulated hardware features to those computed using standard methods, demonstrating a nearly negligible drop in classification performance with the potential for large reductions in computation time.;"Erik M.

It has a number of applications, such as indexing of and searching in musical databases. Traditional music style classification approaches usually assume that each piece of music has a unique style and they make use of the music contents to construct a classifier for classifying each piece into its unique style. However, in reality, a piece may match more than one, even several different styles. Also, in this modern Web 2.0 era, it is easy to get a hold of additional, indirect information (e.g., music tags) about music. This paper proposes a multi-label music style classification approach, called Hypergraph integrated Support Vector Machine (HiSVM), which can integrate both music contents and music tags for automatic music style classification.

Although the subject poses a well studied task in Music Information Retrieval, some fundamental issues of genre classiﬁcation have not been covered so far. Especially many modern genres are inﬂuenced by manifold musical styles. Most of all, this holds true for the broad category “World Music”, which comprises many different regional styles and a mutual mix up thereof. A common approach to tackle this issue in manual categorization is to assign multiple genre labels to a single recording. However, for commonly used automatic classiﬁcation algorithms, multilabeling poses a problem due to its ambiguities. Thus, we propose to break down multi-label genre annotations into single-label annotations within given time segments and musical domains. A corresponding multi-stage evaluation based on a representative set of items from a global music taxonomy is performed and discussed accordingly. Therefore, we conduct 3 different experiments that cover multi-labeling, multi-labeling with time segmentation and the proposed multi-domain labeling.;"Hanna Lukashevich, Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technologies, DEU, facility;Jakob Abeßer, Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technologies, DEU, facility;Christian Dittmar, Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technologies, DEU, facility;Holger Grossmann, Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technologies, DEU, facility";Fraunhofer IDMT,Fraunhofer IDMT,Fraunhofer IDMT,Fraunhofer IDMT;facility, facility, facility, facility;DEU, DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-2.566647;30.646397

The approach is motivated by the observation that in rhythmically complex music, some layers may be more rhythmically regular than the overall mix, thus facilitating tempo detection. Each excerpt was analyzed using PLCA and the resulting components were each tempo tracked using a standard autocorrelation-based algorithm. We describe several techniques for aggregating or choosing among the multiple estimates that result from this process to extract a global tempo estimate. The system was evaluated on the MIREX 2006 training database as well as a newly constructed database of rhythmically complex electronic music consisting of 27 examples (IDM DB). For these databases the algorithms improved accuracy by 10% (60% vs 50%) and 22.3% (48.2% vs. 25.9%) respectively.

Most current audio chord detection algorithms use hidden Markov model (HMM) classifiers because of the task similarity with automatic speech recognition. For most speech recognition algorithms, the performance is measured by word error rate; i.e., only the identity of recognized segments is considered because word boundaries in continuous speech are often ambiguous. In contrast, audio chord detection performance is typically measured in terms of frame error rate, which considers both timing and classification. This paper treats these two tasks separately and focuses on the first problem; i.e., classifying the correct chords given boundary information. The best performing chroma/HMM chord detection algorithm, as measured in the 2008 MIREX Audio Chord Detection Contest, is used as the baseline in this paper. Further improvements are made to reduce feature correlation, account for differences in tuning, and incorporate minimum classification error (MCE) training in obtaining chord HMMs. Experiments demonstrate that classification rates can be improved with tuning compensation and MCE discriminative training.";"J.T.

However, most approaches rely on the Western 12-tone scale, which is not universally used. African music does not follow a fixed tone scale. In order to classify and study African tone scales, we developed a system in which the pitch is first analyzed on a continuous scale. Peak analysis is then applied on these data to extract the actual scale used. This system has been applied to a selection of African music, it allows us to look for similarities using cross-correlation. Thus it provides an interesting tool for query-by-example and database management in collections of ethnic music which can not be simply classified according to keys.

Frieder Stolzenburg;A Periodicity-based Theory for Harmony Perception and Scales.;2009;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1414904;Empirical results demonstrate, that human subjects rate harmonies, e.g. major and minor triads, differently with respect to their sonority. These judgements of listeners have a strong psychophysical basis. Therefore, harmony perception often is explained by the notions of dissonance and tension, computing the consonance of one or two intervals. In this paper, a theory on harmony perception based on the notion of periodicity is introduced. Mathematically, periodicity is derivable from the frequency ratios of the tones in the chord with respect to its lowest tone. The used ratios can be computed by continued fraction expansion and are psychophysically motivated by the just noticeable differences in pitch perception.

Tags express the personal perspectives of the user on the music items (such as songs, artists, or albums) they tagged. These personal perspectives should be taken into account in MIR tasks that assess the similarity between music items. In this paper, we propose an novel approach for clustering music items represented in social tagging systems. Its characteristic is that it determines similarity between items by preserving the 3-way relationships among the inherent dimensions of the data, i.e., users, items, and tags. Conversely to existing approaches that use reductions to 2-way relationships (between items-users or items-tags), this characteristic allows the proposed algorithm to consider the personal perspectives of tags and to improve the clustering quality. Due to the complexity of social tagging data, we focus on spectral clustering that has been proven effective in addressing complex data. However, existing spectral clustering algorithms work with 2-way relationships. To overcome this problem, we develop a novel data-modeling scheme and a tag-aware spectral clustering procedure that uses tensors (high-dimensional arrays) to store the multi-graph structures that capture the personalised aspects of similarity.

The proposed system works ofﬂine in two passes, where in the ﬁrst step a state-of-the art alignment based on chroma vectors and dynamic time warping is performed. In the second step a non-negative matrix factorization is calculated within a small search window around each predicted note onset, using pretrained tone models of only those pitches which are expected to be played within that window. Note onsets are then reset according to the pitch activation patterns yielded by the matrix factorization. In doing so, we are able to resolve individual notes within a chord. We show that this method is feasible of increasing the accuracy of aligned note’s onsets which are already aligned relatively near to the real note attack. However it is so far not suitable for the detection and correction of outliers which are displaced by a large timespan.

Our goal is to achieve a fully automatic DJ mixing system that can preserve overall user comfort level during DJ mixing. In this paper, we assume that the difference between the original and adjusted songs is the main cause of user discomfort in the mixed song. In order to preserve user comfort, we define the measurement function of user discomfort based on the results of a subjective experiment. Furthermore, this paper proposes a unique tempo adjustment technique called “optimal tempo adjustment”, which is robust for any combination of tempi of songs to be mixed. In the subjective experiment, the proposed method obtained higher averages of user ratings on three evaluation items compared to the conventional method.

Current lyric search systems by normal text retrieval techniques are severely deteriorated in the case that the queries of lyric phrases contain incorrect parts due to mishearing and misremembering. To solve this problem, the authors apply acoustic distance, which is computed based on a confusion matrix of an ASR experiment, into DP-based phonetic string matching. The experimental results show that the search accuracy is increased by more than 40% compared with the normal text retrieval method; and by 2% ∼4% compared with the conventional phonetic string matching method. Considering the high computation complexity of DP matching, the authors propose a novel two-pass search strategy to shorten the processing time. By pre-selecting the probable candidates by a rapid index-based search for the first pass and executing a DP-based search among these candidates during the second pass, the proposed method reduces processing time by 85.8% and keeps search accuracy at the same level as that of a complete search by DP matching with all lyrics.";"Xin Xu, KDDI R&D Laboratories, Inc., JPN, company;Masaki Naito, KDDI R&D Laboratories, Inc., JPN, company;Tsuneo Kato, KDDI R&D Laboratories, Inc., JPN, company;Hisashi Kawai, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, JPN, facility";KDDI R&D Laboratories Inc., KDDI R&D Laboratories Inc., KDDI R&D Laboratories Inc., National Institute of Information and Communications Technology;company, company, company, facility;JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-4.0392504;45.95431

The origin is an important metadata element, because it can help to specify subgenres, be an indicator of regional popularity and improve recommendations. In this paper, we present six methods to determine the origin, based on Web data sources: one extracts data from Last.fm, two query Freebase and three analyze biographies. We evaluate the different methods with 11275 artists. Circa 55% of the artists can be classified using biographies. The best Freebase method can classify 26% and the Last.fm based method 7%. When comparing on accuracy, the Last.fm and Freebase methods perform similarly with around 90% accuracy. For the biography-based methods we achieve 71%. To improve coverage, a final, hybrid method achieves 77% accuracy and 60% coverage. The accuracy of the continent classification is 87%.

RhythMiXearch is a music search system we developed that can accept two music inputs and mix those inputs to search for music that could reasonably be a result of the mixture. This approach expands the ability of Query-by-Example and allows greater flexibility for users in finding unknown music. Each music piece stored by our system is characterized by text data written by users, i.e., review data. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to capture semantics from the reviews that were then used to characterize the music by Hevner’s eight impression categories. RhythMiXearch mixes two music inputs in accordance with a probabilistic mixture model and finds music that is the most likely product of the mixture.

Not surprisingly, many of the users’ information seeking actions aim at retrieving music songs based on these perceptual dimensions – moods and themes, expressing how people feel about music or which situations they associate it with.

Still, most existing approaches aiming at inferring some of the songs’ latent characteristics focus on identifying musical genres. In this paper we aim at bridging this gap between users’ information needs and indexed music features by developing algorithms for classifying music songs by moods and themes. We extend existing approaches by also considering the songs’ thematic dimensions and by using social data from the Last.fm music portal, as support for the classiﬁcation tasks.

Furthermore, users expect a complete OMR process for vocal music to include recognition of the lyrics, reuniﬁcation of syllables when they have been separated, and alignment of these lyrics with the recognised music.

Each f0 contour is encoded by a redundant set of wavelet coefﬁcients that represent its shape in level-normalized form at various locations and time scales. This allows a query melody to be exhaustively compared with variable-length portions of a target melody at arbitrary locations while accounting for differences in key and tempo. The method is applied in a Query-by-Humming (QBH) system where users may search a database of recorded pop songs by humming or singing an arbitrary part of the melody of an intended song. The system has fast retrieval times because the wavelet coefﬁcients can be effectively indexed in a binary tree and a vector distance measure instead of dynamic programming is used for comparisons. Using automatic pitch extraction to obtain all f0 contours from acoustic data, the method demonstrates practical performance in an experiment with an existing monophonic data set and in a preliminary experiment with real-world polyphonic music.;"Woojay Jeon, Motorola, Inc., USA, company;Changxue Ma, Motorola, Inc., USA, company;Yan Ming Cheng, Motorola, Inc., USA, company";Motorola Inc., Motorola Inc., Motorola Inc.;company, company, company;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-13.698304;-18.202333

The original pLSI can be applied to collaborative filtering by treating users and items as discrete random variables that follow multinomial distributions. In hybrid recommendation, it is necessary to deal with musical contents that are usually represented as continuous vectorial values. To do this, we propose a continuous pLSI that incorporates Gaussian mixture models. This extension, however, causes a severe local optima problem because it increases the number of parameters drastically. This is considered to be a major factor generating “hubs,” which are items that are inappropriately recommended to almost all users. To solve this problem, we tested three smoothing techniques: multinomial smoothing, Gaussian parameter tying, and artist-based item clustering. The experimental results revealed that although the first method improved nothing, the others significantly improved the recommendation accuracy and reduced the hubness. This indicates that it is important to appropriately limit the model complexity to use the pLSI in practical.;"Kazuyoshi Yoshii, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;facility, facility;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-47.797184;37.528385

"Zafar Rafii;Bryan Pardo";Learning to Control a Reverberator Using Subjective Perceptual Descriptors.;2009;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1418035;The complexity of existing tools for mastering audio can be daunting. Moreover, many people think about sound in individualistic terms (such as “boomy”) that may not have clear mappings onto the controls of existing audio tools. We propose learning to map subjective audio descriptors, such as “boomy”, onto measures of signal properties in order to build a simple controller that manipulates an audio reverberator in terms of a chosen descriptor. For example, “make the sound less boomy”. In the learning process, a user is presented with a series of sounds altered in different ways by a reverberator and asked to rate how well each sound represents the audio concept. The system correlates these ratings with reverberator parameters to build a controller that manipulates reverberation in the user’s terms. In this paper, we focus on developing the mapping between reverberator controls, measures of qualities of reverberation and user ratings. Results on 22 subjects show the system learns quickly (under 3 minutes of training per concept), predicts users responses well (mean correlation coefficient of system predictiveness 0.75) and meets users’ expectations (average human rating of 7.4 out of 10).;"Zafar Rafii, Northwestern University, USA, education;Bryan Pardo, Northwestern University, USA, education";Northwestern University, Northwestern University;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;8.903466;-32.723072
"Zhiyao Duan;Jinyu Han;Bryan Pardo";Harmonically Informed Multi-Pitch Tracking.;2009;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1418045;This paper presents a novel system for multi-pitch tracking, i.e. estimate the pitch trajectory of each monophonic source in a mixture of harmonic sounds. The system consists of two stages: multi-pitch estimation and pitch trajectory formation. In the first stage, we propose a new approach based on modeling spectral peaks and non-peak regions to estimate pitches and polyphony in each single frame. In the second stage, we view the pitch trajectory formation problem as a constrained clustering problem of pitch estimates in all the frames. Constraints are imposed on some pairs of pitch estimates, according to time and frequency proximity. In clustering, harmonic structure is employed as the feature. The proposed system is tested on 10 recorded four-part J. S. Bach chorales. Both multi-pitch estimation and tracking results are very promising. In addition, for multi-pitch estimation, the proposed system is shown to outperform a state-of-the-art multi-pitch estimation approach.;"Zhiyao Duan, Northwestern University, USA, education;Jinyu Han, Northwestern University, USA, education;Bryan Pardo, Northwestern University, USA, education";Northwestern University, Northwestern University, Northwestern University;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;43.746433;-0.87135786

The lexicon is composed of words translated from ANEW and words selected by other means. For each lyric sentence, emotion units, each based on an emotion word in the lexicon, are found out, and the influences of modifiers and tenses on emotion units are taken into consideration. The emotion of a sentence is calculated from its emotion units. To figure out the prominent emotions of a lyric, a fuzzy clustering method is used to group the lyric’s sentences according to their emotions. The emotion of a cluster is worked out from that of its sentences considering the individual weight of each sentence. Clusters are weighted according to the weights and confidences of their sentences and singing speeds of sentences are considered as the adjustment of the weights of clusters. Finally, the emotion of the cluster with the highest weight is selected from the prominent emotions as the main emotion of the lyric. The performance of our approach is evaluated through an experiment of emotion classification of 500 Chinese song lyrics.;"Yajie Hu, Peking University, CHN, education;Xiaoou Chen, Peking University, CHN, education;Deshun Yang, Peking University, CHN, education";Peking University, Peking University, Peking University;education, education, education;CHN, CHN, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;-20.684868;55.984425

The present work shows that additional exploitation of the repetitive structure of songs can enhance chord extraction, by combining chroma information from multiple occurrences of the same segment type.

We adopt a first-order logic representation of harmony and musical genres: pieces of music are represented as lists of chords and musical genres are seen as context-free definite clause grammars using subsequences of these chord lists. To induce the context-free definite clause grammars characterising the genres we use a first-order logic decision tree induction algorithm. We report on the adaptation of this classification framework to audio data using an automatic chord transcription algorithm. We also introduce a high-level harmony representation scheme which describes the chords in term of both their degrees and chord categories. When compared to another high-level harmony representation scheme used in a previous study, it obtains better classification accuracies and shorter run times.

Therefore it is essential to develop and evaluate systems that support guided exploratory browsing of the music space. While a number of algorithms for organizing music collections according to a given similarity measure have been applied successfully, the generated structure is usually only presented visually and listening requires cumbersome skipping through the individual pieces. To close this media gap we describe an immersive multimodal exploration environment which extends the presentation of a song collection in a video-game-like virtual 3-D landscape by carefully adjusted spatialized plackback of songs. The user can freely navigate through the virtual world guided by the acoustic clues surrounding him. Observing his interaction with the environment the system furthermore learns the user’s way of structuring his collection by adapting a weighted combination of a wide range of integrated content-based, meta-data-based and collaborative similarity measures.

In this paper, we introduce a novel mid-level representation which captures predominant local pulse information. To this end, we first derive a tempogram by performing a local spectral analysis on a previously extracted, possibly very noisy onset representation. From this, we derive for each time position the predominant tempo as well as a sinusoidal kernel that best explains the local periodic nature of the onset representation. Then, our main idea is to accumulate the local kernels over time yielding a single function that reveals the predominant local pulse (PLP). We show that this function constitutes a robust mid-level representation from which one can derive musically meaningful tempo and beat information for non-percussive music even in the presence of significant tempo fluctuations. Furthermore, our representation allows for incorporating prior knowledge on the expected tempo range to exhibit information on different pulse levels.;"Peter Grosche, Saarland University and MPI Informatik, DEU, education;Meinard Müller, Saarland University and MPI Informatik, DEU, education";Saarland University, Saarland University;education, education;DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;49.600895;13.509969

In this paper, we introduce an automated approach for segmenting folk song recordings into its constituent stanzas, which can then be made accessible to folk song researchers by means of suitable visualization, searching, and navigation interfaces. Performed by elderly non-professional singers, the main challenge with the recordings is that most singers have serious problems with the intonation, fluctuating with their voices even over several semitones throughout a song.

This information is given in the form of a tempo curve that reveals the relative tempo difference between an actual performance and some reference representation of the underlying musical piece.

While there are a number of ways to collect and generate tags, there is generally a data sparsity problem in which very few songs and artists have been accurately annotated with a sufficiently large set of relevant tags. We explore the idea of tag propagation to help alleviate the data sparsity problem. Tag propagation, originally proposed by Sordo et al., involves annotating a novel artist with tags that have been frequently associated with other similar artists. In this paper, we explore four approaches for computing artists similarity based on different sources of music information (user preference data, social tags, web documents, and audio content). We compare these approaches in terms of their ability to accurately propagate three different types of tags (genres, acoustic descriptors, social tags). We find that the approach based on collaborative filtering performs best. This is somewhat surprising considering that it is the only approach that is not explicitly based on notions of semantic similarity.

The mixture signal is decomposed into a sum of spectral bases modeled as a product of excitations and ﬁlters. The excitations are restricted to harmonic spectra and their fundamental frequencies are estimated in advance using a multipitch estimator, whereas the ﬁlters are restricted to have smooth frequency responses by modeling them as a sum of elementary functions on the Mel-frequency scale. The pitch and timbre information are used in organizing individual notes into sound sources. In the recognition, Mel-frequency cepstral coefﬁcients are used to represent the coarse shape of the power spectrum of sound sources and Gaussian mixture models are used to model instrument-conditional densities of the extracted features.

Thus, it was suggested recently to use social networks as an alternative ranking system; a suggestion which is problematic due to the ease of manipulating the list and the difﬁculty of implementation. In this work we suggest to use logs of queries from peer-to-peer ﬁle-sharing systems for ranking song success. We show that the trend and ﬂuctuations of the popularity of a song in the Billboard list have strong correlation (0.89) to the ones in a list built from the P2P network, and that the P2P list has a week advantage over the Billboard list.

We introduce three chord models taking into account one or more harmonics for the notes of the chord. The use of pre-determined chord models enables to consider several types of chords (major, minor, dominant seventh, minor seventh, augmented, diminished...). After extracting a chromagram from the signal, the detected chord over a frame is the one minimizing a measure of fit between the chromagram frame and the chord templates. Several popular measures in the probability and signal processing field are considered for our task. In order to take into account the time persistence, we perform a post-processing filtering over the recognition criteria. The transcription tool is evaluated on the 13 Beatles albums with different chord types and compared to state-of-the-art chord recognition methods. We particularly focus on the influence of the chord types considered over the performances of the system. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art and more importantly is less computationally demanding than the other evaluated systems.;"Laurent Oudre, Institut TELECOM, TELECOM ParisTech, CNRS LTCI, FRA, education;Yves Grenier, Institut TELECOM, TELECOM ParisTech, CNRS LTCI, FRA, education;C´edric F´evotte, CNRS LTCI, TELECOM ParisTech, FRA, education";Telecom ParisTech,Telecom ParisTech,Telecom ParisTech;education, education, education;FRA, FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;25.911362;-54.950237

The primary aims of the system are to present perceptually relevant features and audio descriptors via visual designs to gain more insight into electro-acoustic music works and provide easy-to-use “click-and-go” software interface paradigms for practical use of the system by non-experts and experts alike. The development of the EASY system exploits MIR techniques with particular emphasis on the electro-acoustic music repertoire – musical pieces that concentrate on timbral dimensions rather than traditional elements such as pitch, melody, harmony, and rhythm. The project was mainly inspired by the lack of software tools available for aiding electro-acoustic music analysis.

More specifically, the audio signal is converted into a compact symbolic representation that retains timbral characteristics and accounts for the temporal structure of a music piece. Models that capture the temporal dependencies observed in the symbolic sequences of a set of music pieces are built using a statistical language modeling approach. The proposed method is evaluated on two classification tasks (Music Genre classification and Artist Identification) using publicly available datasets. Finally, a distance measure between music pieces is derived from the method and examples of playlists generated using this distance are given. The proposed method is compared with two alternative approaches which include the use of Hidden Markov Models and a classification scheme that ignores the temporal structure of the sequences of symbols.

However, this framework is not the only one the task allows. In this article, we revise the task of identifying cover songs to include the notion of sets (or groups) of covers. In particular, we study the application of unsupervised clustering and community detection algorithms to detect cover sets. We consider current state-of-the-art algorithms and propose new methods to achieve this goal. Our experiments show that the detection of cover sets is feasible, that it can be performed in a reasonable amount of time, that it does not require extensive parameter tuning, and that it presents certain robustness to inaccurate measurements. Furthermore, we highlight two direct outcomes that naturally arise from the proposed framework revision: increasing the accuracy of query retrieval-based systems and detecting the original song within a set of covers.;"Joan Serr`a, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Massimiliano Zanin, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, ESP, education;Cyril Laurier, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Mohamed Sordo, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education, education, education;ESP, ESP, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;13.755883;45.925114

By taking a pattern recognition approach we evaluate more than 2,450 objectlevel features. Three binary instrument-wise support vector machines (SVM) are built from a training set of more that 100 songs and 10 genres. Then, we use these binary models to build a drum transcription system achieving comparable results with state of the art algorithms. Finally, we present 17 song-level percussion descriptors computed from the imperfect output of the transcription algorithm. We evaluate the usefulness of the proposed descriptors in music information retrieval (MIR) tasks like genre classiﬁcation, danceability estimation and Western vs. nonWestern music discrimination. We conclude that the presented song-level percussion descriptors provide complementary information to “classic” descriptors, that can help in the previously mentioned MIR tasks.;"Martín Haro, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain, education;Perfecto Herrera, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education;ESP, ESP;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;53.39399;-23.951662

SongExplorer addresses the problem of finding new interesting songs on large music databases, from an interaction design perspective. Using high level descriptors of musical songs, SongExplorer creates a coherent 2D map based on similarity, in which neighboring songs tend to be more similar. All songs are represented as throbbing circles that highlight their more relevant high-level properties, and the resulting music map is browseable and zoomable by the users who can use their fingers as well as specially designed tangible pucks, for helping them to find interesting music, independently of their previous knowledge of the collection. SongExplorer also offers basic player capabilities, allowing the users to organize the songs they have just discovered into playlists which can be manipulated as well as played and displayed.

The music collection under study gathers around 6,000 pieces, including traditional music from different geographical zones and countries, as well as a varied set of Western musical styles. We achieve promising results when trying to automatically distinguish music from Western and non-Western traditions. A 86.68% of accuracy is obtained using only 23 audio features, which are representative of distinct musical facets (timbre, tonality, rhythm), indicating their complementarity for music description. We also analyze the relative performance of the different facets and the capability of various descriptors to identify certain types of music. We ﬁnally present some results on the relationship between geographical location and musical features in terms of extracted descriptors.

In particular, the presented study accounts for three aspects currently lacking in literature: model scalability to polyphonic data, model generalisation in respect to the number of instruments, and incorporation of perceptual information. Therefore, our goal is a unifying recognition framework which enables the extraction of the main instruments’ information. The applied methodology consists of training classiﬁers with audio descriptors, using extensive datasets to model the instruments sufﬁciently. All data consist of real world music, including categories of 11 pitched and 3 percussive instruments. We designed our descriptors by temporal integration of the raw feature values, which are directly extracted from the polyphonic data. Moreover, to evaluate the applicability of modelling temporal aspects in polyphonic audio, we studied the performance of different encodings of the temporal information. Along with accuracies of 63% and 78% for the pitched and percussive classiﬁcation task, results show both the importance of temporal encoding as well as strong limitations of modelling it accurately.;"Ferdinand Fuhrmann, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Martín Haro, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Perfecto Herrera, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education, education;ESP, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;30.029593;-27.465717

We aim to analyze how do people tag music by mood, to create representations based on this data and to study the agreement between experts and a large community. For this purpose, we create a semantic mood space from last.fm tags using Latent Semantic Analysis. With an unsupervised clustering approach, we derive from this space an ideal categorical representation. We compare our community based semantic space with expert representations from Hevner and the clusters from the MIREX Audio Mood Classiﬁcation task. Using dimensional reduction with a Self-Organizing Map, we obtain a 2D representation that we compare with the dimensional model from Russell. We present as well a tree diagram of the mood tags obtained with a hierarchical clustering approach. All these results show a consistency between the community and the experts as well as some limitations of current expert models. This study demonstrates a particular relevancy of the basic emotions model with four mood clusters that can be summarized as: happy, sad, angry and tender.

Wijnand Schepens;Chronicle: Representation of Complex Time Structures.;2009;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417353;Chronicle is a novel open source system for representing structured data involving time, such as music. It offers an XML-based ﬁle format, object models for internal representation in various programming languages, and software libraries and tools for reading and writing XML and for data transformations. Chronicle deﬁnes basic blocks for representing time-based information using events, a hierarchy of groups and instantiable templates. It supports two modes of timing: local timing within a group and association with other el-ements. The built-in mechanism for resolving time references can be used to implement both timescale mappings and tagging of information. Chronicle aims to be a powerful and ﬂexible foundation on which new ﬁle formats and software can be built. Chronicle focuses on structure and timing, but leaves the actual content free to choose. Thus formator software-developers can specify their own domain-model. This makes it possible to make representations for different types of musical information (scores, performance data, ...) in different styles or cultures (CMN, non-western, contempo-rary, ...), but also for other domains like choreography, scheduling, task management, and so on. It is also ideal for structured tagging of audio and multimedia (movie subtitles, karaoke, synchronisation, ...) and for representing ”internal” data used in music algorithms. The system is organized in four levels of increasing com-plexity. Software developed for a speciﬁc level and domain will also accept lower level data, while users can choose to represent data in a higher level and use Chronicle tools to reduce the level.;Wijnand Schepens, University College Ghent, Belgium, education;University College Ghent;education;BEL;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;37.05523;23.305008

Though discovered automatically, these dis-tributions closely resemble the traditional key-proﬁles used to indicate the stability and importance of neutral pitch-classes in the major and minor keys of western music. Un-like earlier approaches based on human judgement, our model learns key-proﬁles in an unsupervised manner, in-ferring them automatically from a large musical corpus that contains no key annotations. We show how these learned key-proﬁles can be used to determine the key of a musical piece and track its harmonic modulations. We also show how the model’s inferences can be used to compare musi-cal pieces based on their harmonic structure.;"Diane J. Hu, University of California, San Diego, USA, education;Lawrence K.

"Luke Barrington;Reid Oda;Gert R. G. Lanckriet";Smarter than Genius? Human Evaluation of Music Recommender Systems.;2009;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417803;Genius is a popular commercial music recommender system that is based on collaborative ﬁltering of huge amounts of user data. To understand the aspects of music similarity that collaborative ﬁltering can capture, we compare Genius to two canonical music recommender systems: one based purely on artist similarity, the other purely on similarity of acoustic content. We evaluate this comparison with a user study of 185 subjects. Overall, Genius produces the best recommendations. We demonstrate that collaborative ﬁltering can actually capture similarities between the acoustic content of songs. However, when evaluators can see the names of the recommended songs and artists, we ﬁnd that artist similarity can account for the performance of Genius. A system that combines these musical cues could generate music recommendations that are as good as Genius, even when collaborative ﬁltering data is unavailable.;"Luke Barrington, University of California, San Diego, USA, education;Reid Oda, University of California, San Diego, USA, education;Gert Lanckriet, University of California, San Diego, USA, education";University of California San Diego, University of California San Diego, University of California San Diego;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-44.780945;34.778015
"Jennifer MacRitchie;Bryony Buck;Nicholas J.

It has been demonstrated that performers’ physical gestures correlate with structural and emotional aspects of the piece they are performing and that this information can be decoded by an audience when presented with a visualonly performance [2]. This paper investigates the relationship between direction of physical movement and underlying musical structures. The Vicon motion capture system is used to record 3D movements made by nine university-level pianists performing Chopin preludes op.28 Nos 6 and 7. The examination of several pianists provides insight into the similarity and diﬀerences in gestures between performers and how these relate to structure. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of these performances and consequent analysis of variance reveals a relationship between extrema of the ﬁrst six signiﬁcant components and timing of phrasing structure in Prelude 7 where motion troughs consistently lag behind the occurence of phrase boundaries in the audio. This relationship is then examined for Prelude 6 which encompasses longer, expanded phrases and changes in rhythm. These expanded phrases are associated with elongated or split gestures, and variations of the motif with changes in movement.;"J.MacRitchie, University of Glasgow, GBR, education;B.Buck, University of Glasgow, GBR, education;N.J.Bailey, University of Glasgow, GBR, education";University of Glasgow, University of Glasgow, University of Glasgow;education, education, education;GBR, GBR, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-38.361572;-3.0889935

Musical representations and similarity measures are designed to capture musically relevant invariances, such as transposition invariance.

We discuss the musical relevance of various musical invariances and develop a set-theoretic formalism, for deﬁning and classifying them. Using it, we deﬁne the most common invariances, and give a taxonomy which they inhabit.

However, what should be predicted, and precisely how, remain a challenge in the ﬁeld. We provide an empirical comparison of two common paradigms of emotion representation in music, opposing a multidimensional space to a set of basic emotions. New ground-truth data consisting of ﬁlm soundtracks was used to assess the compatibility of these models. The ﬁndings suggest that the two are highly compatible and a quantitative mapping between the two is provided. Next we propose a model predicting perceived emotions based on a set of features extracted from the audio. The feature selection and transformation is given special emphasis and three separate data reduction techniques are compared (stepwise regression, principal component analysis, and partial least squares regression). Best linear models consisting of 2-5 predictors from the data reduction process were able to account for between 58 and 85% of the variance. In general, partial least squares models performed the best and the data transformation has a signiﬁcant role in building linear models.;"Tuomas Eerola, University of Jyväskylä, Finland, education;Olivier Lartillot, University of Jyväskylä, Finland, education;Petri Toiviainen, University of Jyväskylä, Finland, education";University of Jyväskylä, University of Jyväskylä, University of Jyväskylä;education, education, education;FIN, FIN, FIN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-27.803759;55.56523

Field recordings are integral documents of folk music performances and typically contain interviews with performers intertwined with actual performances. As these are live recordings of amateur folk musicians, they may contain interruptions, false starts, environmental noises or other interfering factors. Our goal was to design a robust algorithm that would approximate manual segmentation of field recordings. First, short audio fragments are classified into one of the following categories: speech, solo singing, choir singing, instrumental or bell chiming performance. Then, a set of candidate segment boundaries is obtained by observing how the energy of the signal and its content change, and finally the recording is segmented with a probabilistic model that maximizes the posterior probability of segments given a set of candidate segment boundaries with their probabilities and prior knowledge of lengths of segments belonging to different categories. Evaluation of the algorithm on a set of field recordings from the Ehtnomuse archive is presented.;Matija Marolt, University of Ljubljana, SVN, education;University of Ljubljana;education;SVN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-16.157179;24.642199

Different interpretations of the same song are called song variants, all variants of a song belong to the same variant type. In the paper, we explore how various melody-based features relate to folk song variants. Specifically, we explore whether we can derive a melodic similarity measure that would correlate to variant types in the sense that it would measure songs belonging to the same variant type as more similar, in contrast to songs from different variant types. The measure would be useful for folk song retrieval based on variant types, classification of unknown tunes, as well as a measure of similarity between variant types. We experimented with a number of melodic features calculated from symbolic representations of folk song melodies and combined them into a melody-based folk song similarity measure. We evaluated the measure on the task of classifying an unknown melody into a set of existing variant types. We show that the proposed measure gives the correct variant type in the top 10 list for 68% of queries in our data set.;"Ciril Bohak, University of Ljubljana, SVN, education;Matija Marolt, University of Ljubljana, SVN, education";University of Ljubljana, University of Ljubljana;education, education;SVN, SVN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-13.868387;-4.019981

A automated algorithm for Schenkerian analysis would be extremely useful to music scholars and researchers studying music from a computational standpoint. The ﬁrst major step in producing a Schenkerian analysis involves selecting notes from the composition in question for the primary soprano and bass parts of the analysis.

We present a query-by-example-based user interface that shows songs related to the one currently playing. This relation is not based on overall similarity, but on the similarity between the part currently playing and parts of other songs in the collection along different dimensions (pitch, timbre, bars, beats, loudness). The similarity is initially computed automatically, but can be corrected by the user. Once a sufficient number of corrections has been made, we expect the similarity measure to reach an even higher precision. Our system thereby allows users to discover hidden similarities on the level of song sections instead of whole songs.;"Dominikus Baur, University of Munich (LMU), DEU, education;Tim Langer, University of Munich (LMU), DEU, education;Andreas Butz, University of Munich (LMU), DEU, education";University of Munich, University of Munich, University of Munich;education, education, education;DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-15.580793;13.936793

Many musical genres are characterized not only by timbral information but also by distinct representative bass-line patterns. So far this kind of temporal features have not so effectively been utilized. In particular, modern music songs mostly have certain fixed bar-long bass-line patterns per genre. For instance, while frequently bass-lines in rock music have constant pitch and a uniform rhythm, in jazz music there are many characteristic movements such as walking bass. We propose a representative bass-line pattern template extraction method based on k-means clustering handling a pitch-shift problem. After extracting the fundamental bass-line pattern templates for each genre, distances from each template are calculated and used as a feature vector for supervised learning. Experimental result shows that the automatically calculated bass-line pattern information can be used for genre classification effectively and improve upon current approaches based on timbral features.;"Emiru Tsunoo, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education;Nobutaka Ono, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education;Shigeki Sagayama, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education";University of Tokyo, University of Tokyo, University of Tokyo;education, education, education;JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;4.600597;31.818361

The evaluation of their retrieval performance on a well-annotated set of 360 folk-song melodies with various kinds of melodic variation, shows that a combination of pitch, rhythm and segmentation-based scoring functions performs best, with a mean average precision of 0.83.;"Peter van Kranenburg, Utrecht University, NLD, education;Anja Volk, Utrecht University, NLD, education;Frans Wiering, Utrecht University, NLD, education;Remco C.

In this study, a corpus of 3367 folk songs, divided into six geographic regions, has been created and is used to evaluate two popular yet contrasting methods for symbolic melody classiﬁcation. For the task of folk song classification, a global feature approach, which summarizes a melody as a feature vector, is outperformed by an event model of abstract event features. The best accuracy obtained on the folk song corpus was achieved with an ensemble of event models. These results indicate that the event model should be the default model of choice for folk song classification.;"Ruben Hillewaere, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, BEL, education;Bernard Manderick, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, BEL, education;Darrell Conklin, City University London, GBR, education";Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, City University London;education, education, education;BEL, BEL, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-0.39541304;27.518696

First, each music recording is represented by bio-inspired auditory temporal modulations.

The proposed algorithm is referred to as Sparse Multi-label Linear Embedding Nonnegative Tensor Factorization, whose convergence to a stationary point is guaranteed. Finally, a recently proposed method is employed to propagate the multiple labels of training auditory temporal modulations to auditory temporal modulations extracted from a test music recording by means of the sparse ℓ1 reconstruction coefﬁcients.

We verify that this effect also exists in very large databases (> 250000 songs) and that it even gets worse with growing size of databases.

They are used as the de facto standard representation of music timbre to compute music similarity. However, standard algorithms for clustering and visualization are usually not designed to handle Gaussian distributions and their attached metrics (e.g. the Kullback-Leibler divergence). Hence to use these features the algorithms generally handle them indirectly by first mapping them to a vector space, for example by deriving a feature vector representation from a similarity matrix. This paper uses the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler centroid of Gaussians to show how to avoid the vectorization detour for the Self Organizing Maps (SOM) data visualization algorithm. We propose an approach so that the algorithm can directly and naturally work on Gaussian music similarity features to compute maps of music collections.

"Christian Fremerey;Meinard Müller;Michael Clausen";Handling Repeats and Jumps in Score-performance Synchronization.;2010;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415942;Given a score representation and a recorded performance of the same piece of music, the task of score-performance synchronization is to temporally align musical sections such as bars speciﬁed by the score to temporal sections in the performance. Most of the previous approaches assume that the score and the performance to be synchronized globally agree with regard to the overall musical structure. In practice, however, this assumption is often violated. For example, a performer may deviate from the score by ignoring a repeat or introducing an additional repeat that is not written in the score. In this paper, we introduce a synchronization approach that can cope with such structural differences. As main technical contribution, we describe a novel variant of dynamic time warping (DTW), referred to as JumpDTW, which allows for handling jumps and repeats in the alignment. Our approach is evaluated for the practically relevant case of synchronizing score data obtained from scanned sheet music via optical music recognition to corresponding audio recordings. Our experiments based on Beethoven piano sonatas show that JumpDTW can robustly identify and handle most of the occurring jumps and repeats leading to an overall alignment accuracy of over 99% on the bar-level.;"Christian Fremerey, Bonn University, DEU, education;Meinard Müller, Saarland University, DEU, education; MPI Informatik, DEU, facility;Michael Clausen, Bonn University, DEU, education";University of Bonn, Saarland University,University of Bonn;education, education, education;DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;33.025475;12.39497

This paper discusses a Discourse Analysis of thirty interview texts related to the process. Coded examples are presented and discussed. Four interpretive repertoires are identified: the Musical Repertoire, the Soundtrack Repertoire, the Business Repertoire and the Cultural Repertoire. These ways of talking about music are adopted by all of the community regardless of their interest as Music Owner or Music User. Music is shown to have multi-variate and sometimes conflicting meanings within this community which are dynamic and negotiated. This is related to a theoretical feedback model of communication and meaning making which proposes that Owners and Users employ their own and shared ways of talking and thinking about music and its context to determine musical meaning.

Our system requires no prior knowledge of the instruments in the mixture, although it can benefit from this information if available. In contrast to many existing polyphonic transcription systems, our approach explicitly models the individual instruments and is thereby able to assign detected notes to their respective sources. We use a set of training instruments to learn a model space which is then used during transcription to constrain the properties of models fit to the target mixture. In addition, we encourage model sparsity using a simple approach related to tempering. We evaluate our method on both recorded and synthesized two-instrument mixtures, obtaining average frame-level F-measures of up to 0.60 for synthesized audio and 0.53 for recorded audio. If knowledge of the instrument types in the mixture is available, we can increase these measures to 0.68 and 0.58, respectively, by initializing the model with parameters from similar instruments.;"Graham Grindlay, Columbia University, USA, education;Daniel P.W.

Good representations are critical, yet current systems use ad hoc constructions such as the chromagram that have been shown to work quite well. We investigate ways to learn chromagram-like representations that optimize the classification of “matching” vs. “non-matching” frame pairs of audio and MIDI.

Chord identiﬁcation is typically performed by analyzing the audio, using a chroma based feature to extract pitch class information, then identifying the chord with the appropriate label. Even if this method proves perfectly accurate, stringed instruments add extra ambiguity as a single chord or melody may be played in different positions on the fretboard. Preserving this information is important, because it signiﬁes the original ﬁngering, and implied “easiest” way to perform the selection. This chord identiﬁcation system combines analysis of audio to determine the general chord scale (i.e. A major, G minor), and video of the guitarist to determine chord voicing (i.e. open, barred, inversion), to accurately identify the guitar chord.;"Alex Hrybyk, Drexel University, USA, education;Youngmoo Kim, Drexel University, USA, education";Drexel University, Drexel University;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;27.818542;-53.196144

To explore the ways in which these structures are connected with the qualities of sounds, a semantic space was extracted from a large collection of musical tags with latent semantic and cluster analysis. The perceptual and musical properties of 19 clusters were investigated by a similarity rating task that used spliced musical excerpts representing each cluster. The resulting perceptual space denoting the clusters correlated high with selected acoustical features extracted from the stimuli. The ﬁrst dimension related to the high-frequency energy content, the second to the regularity of the spectrum, and the third to the ﬂuctuations within the spectrum.

"Dingding Wang;Tao Li;Mitsunori Ogihara";Hierarchical Co-Clustering of Artists and Tags.;2010;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416718;The user-assigned tag is a growingly important research topic in MIR. Noticing that some tags are more speciﬁc versions of others, this paper studies the problem of organizing tags into a hierarchical structure by taking into account the fact that the corresponding artists are organized into a hierarchy based on genre and style. A novel clustering algorithm, Hierarchical Co-clustering Algorithm (HCC), is proposed as a solution. Unlike traditional hierarchical clustering algorithms that deal with homogeneous data only, the proposed algorithm simultaneously organizes two distinct data types into hierarchies. HCC is additionally able to receive constraints that state certain objects “must-be-together” or “should-be-together” and build clusters so as to satisfying the constraints.

Isolated vocal track segments, taken from acapella versions of commercial recordings, are classiﬁed into classes singing and rap. A feature-set motivated by work from song / speech classiﬁcation, speech emotion recognition, and from differences that humans perceive and utilize, is presented. An SVM is used as classiﬁer, accuracies of about 90% are achieved. In addition, the features are analyzed according to their contribution, using the IRMFSP feature selection algorithm.

Jouni Paulus;Improving Markov Model Based Music Piece Structure Labelling with Acoustic Information.;2010;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416732;This paper proposes using acoustic information in the labelling of music piece structure descriptions. Here, music piece structure means the sectional form of the piece: temporal segmentation and grouping to parts such as chorus or verse. The structure analysis methods rarely provide the parts with musically meaningful names. The proposed method labels the parts in a description. The baseline method models the sequential dependencies between musical parts with N-grams and uses them for the labelling. The acoustic model proposed in this paper is based on the assumption that the parts with the same label even in different pieces share some acoustic properties compared to other parts in the same pieces. The proposed method uses mean and standard deviation of relative loudness in a part as the feature which is then modelled with a single multivariate Gaussian distribution. The method is evaluated on three data sets of popular music pieces, and in all of them the inclusion of the acoustic model improves the labelling accuracy over the baseline method.;Jouni Paulus, Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, DEU, facility;Fraunhofer IIS-A;facility;DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;3.3062212;9.086178

Even musically untrained listeners unconsciously analyze and segment music with regard to various musical aspects, for example, identifying recurrent themes or detecting temporal boundaries between contrasting musical parts. This paper gives an overview of state-of-the-art methods for computational music structure analysis, where the general goal is to divide an audio recording into temporal segments corresponding to musical parts and to group these segments into musically meaningful categories. There are many different criteria for segmenting and structuring music audio. In particular, one can identify three conceptually different approaches, which we refer to as repetition-based, novelty-based, and homogeneity-based approaches. Furthermore, one has to account for different musical dimensions such as melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre. In our state-of-the-art report, we address these different issues in the context of music structure analysis, while discussing and categorizing the most relevant and recent articles in this field.;"Jouni Paulus, Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, DEU, facility;Meinard Müller, Saarland University, DEU, education; MPI Informatik, DEU, education;Anssi Klapuri, Queen Mary Univ. of London, GBR, education";Fraunhofer IIS-A, Saarland University, Queen Mary University of London;facility, education, education;DEU, DEU, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;2.9941397;6.826865

Using cross-entropy as a measure of model ﬁt, the best model attained an entropy rate of 0.780 in a cross-validation experiment, showing that symbolic tabla compositions can be effectively encoded using such a model. The choice of smoothing algorithm, which determines how information from different-order models is combined, is found to be an important factor in the models performance. We extend the basic n-gram model by adding viewpoints, other streams of information that can be used to improve predictive performance. First, we show that adding a short-term model, built on the current composition and not the entire corpus, leads to substantial improvements. Additional experiments were conducted with derived types, representations derived from the basic data type (stroke names), and cross-types, which model dependencies between parameters, such as duration and stroke name.

"Tim Crawford;Matthias Mauch;Christophe Rhodes";Recognising Classical Works in Historical Recordings.;2010;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417429;In collections of recordings of classical music, it is normal to find multiple performances, usually by different artists, of the same pieces of music. While there may be differences in many dimensions of musical similarity, such as timbre, pitch or structural detail, the underlying musical content is essentially and recognizably the same. The degree of divergence is generally less than that found between ‘cover songs’ in the domain of popular music, and much less than in typical performances of jazz standards. MIR methods, based around variants of the chroma representation, can be useful in tasks such as work identification especially where disco/bibliographical metadata is absent or incomplete as well as for access, curation and management of collections.

Our approach is based on explicit knowledge of the musical audio at note level from a score-audio alignment, which we termed Informed Source Separation (ISS).

We assume that a spectrogram mask for the solo is obtained and focus on the problem of repairing audio resulting from applying the mask.

We either search for unmasked (orchestra) partials of the orchestra to be transposed onto a masked (solo) region or reshape a solo partial with phase and amplitude imputed from unmasked regions.

In this paper we develop a conceptual framework that allows connecting all three undesired properties. We show that hubs and “orphans” are expected to appear in high-dimensional data spaces, and relate the cause of their appearance with the concentration property of distance / similarity measures.

A method is described to detect if octave errors have occurred in beat tracking. Following an initial beat tracking estimation, a feature vector of metrical proﬁle separated by spectral subbands is computed. A measure of subbeat quaver (1/8th note) alternation is used to compare half time and double time measures against the initial beat track estimation and indicate a likely octave error. This error estimate can then be used to re-estimate the beat rate. The performance of the approach is evaluated against the RWC database, showing successful identiﬁcation of octave errors for an existing beat tracker. Using the octave error detector together with the existing beat tracking model improved beat tracking by reducing octave errors to 43% of the previous error rate.;Leigh M.

The extraction is focused on overcoming the difﬁculties due to harmonic / percussive sound interferences, possibility of octave mismatch, and dynamic variation in melody. The main idea of the algorithm is to consider probabilistic relations between melody and polyphonic audio. Melody is assumed to follow a Markov process, and the framed segments of polyphonic audio are assumed to be conditionally independent given the parameters that represent the melody. The melody parameters are estimated using sequential importance sampling (SIS) which is a conventional particle ﬁlter method. In this paper, the likelihood and state transition are deﬁned to overcome the aforementioned difﬁculties. The SIS algorithm relies on sequential importance density, and this density is designed using multiple pitches which are estimated by a simple multi-pitch extraction algorithm. Experimental results show that the considered algorithm outperforms other famous melody extraction algorithms in terms of the raw pitch accuracy (RPA) and the raw chroma accuracy (RCA).;"Seokhwan Jo, Korea Advanced Institute of Science Technology, KOR, education;Chang D.

In classical music, there are many interpretations to a particular piece, and ﬁnding “the” interpretation that matches the listener’s taste allows a listener to further enjoy the piece. The critical issue in ﬁnding such an interpretation is the way or interface to allow the listener to listen through different interpretations. Our interface allows a user, by swinging a conducting hardware interface, to conduct the desired global tempo along the playback of a piece, at any time in the piece. The real-time conducting input by the user dynamically switches the interpretation being played back to the one closest to how the user is currently conducting. At the end of the piece, our interface ranks each interpretation according to how close the tempo of each interpretation was to the user input. At the core of our interface is an automated tempo estimation method based on audio-score alignment. We improve tempo estimation by requiring the audio-score alignment of different interpretations to be consistent with each other.

Alan Marsden;Recognition of Variations Using Automatic Schenkerian Reduction.;2010;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1418179;Experiments on techniques to automatically recognise whether or not an extract of music is a variation of a given theme are reported, using a test corpus derived from ten of Mozart‘s sets of variations for piano. Methods which examine the notes of the ‗surface‘ are compared with methods which make use of an automatically derived quasi-Schenkerian reduction of the theme and the extract in question. The maximum average F-measure achieved was 0.87. Unexpectedly, this was for a method of matching based on the surface alone, and in general the results for matches based on the surface were marginally better than those based on reduction, though the small number of possible test queries means that this result cannot be regarded as conclusive. Other inferences on which factors seem to be important in recognising variations are discussed. Possibilities for improved recognition of matching using reduction are outlined.;Alan Marsden, Lancaster Institute for the Contemporary Arts, Lancaster University, UK, education;Lancaster University;education;GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-29.51101;-35.68238

This has led to various studies that focused on finding solutions to solve this problem. Analyzing music contents (often referred as content-based analysis) is one of many ways to identify and group similar songs together. Various music contents, for example beat, pitch, timbral and many others were used and analyzed to represent the music. To be able to manipulate these content representations for recognition: feature extraction and classification are two major focuses of investigation in this area. Though various classification techniques proposed so far, we are introducing yet another one. The objective of this paper is to introduce a possible new technique in the Artificial Immune System (AIS) domain called a modified immune classifier (MIC) for music genre classification. MIC is the newest version of Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) where it stresses the self and non-self cells recognition and a complementary process for generating detectors. The discussion will detail out the MIC procedures applied and the modified part in solving the classification problem.

"Kazuyoshi Yoshii;Masataka Goto";Infinite Latent Harmonic Allocation: A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach to Multipitch Analysis.;2010;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1414912;This paper presents a statistical method called Infinite Latent Harmonic Allocation (iLHA) for detecting multiple fundamental frequencies in polyphonic audio signals. Conventional methods face a crucial problem known as model selection because they assume that the observed spectra are superpositions of a certain fixed number of bases (sound sources and/or finer parts). iLHA avoids this problem by assuming that the observed spectra are superpositions of a stochastically-distributed unbounded (theoretically infinite) number of bases. Such uncertainty can be treated in a principled way by leveraging the state-of-the-art paradigm of machine-learning called Bayesian nonparametrics. To represent a set of time-sliced spectral strips, we formulated nested infinite Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) based on hierarchical and generalized Dirichlet processes. Each strip is allowed to contain an unbounded number of sound sources (GMMs), each of which is allowed to contain an unbounded number of harmonic partials (Gaussians). To train the nested infinite GMMs efficiently, we used a modern inference technique called collapsed variational Bayes (CVB). Our experiments using audio recordings of real piano and guitar performances showed that fully automated iLHA based on noninformative priors performed as well as optimally tuned conventional methods.;"Kazuyoshi Yoshii, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;facility, facility;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;21.506882;-40.132843

The sinusoidal partials of the musical audio signals are first extracted. The Fourier transform is then applied to extract the vibrato/tremolo information of each partial. Some criteria based on this vibrato/tremolo information are employed to discriminate the vocal partials from the music accompaniment partials. Besides, a singing pitch trend estimation algorithm which is able to find the global singing progressing tunnel is also proposed. The singing pitches can then be extracted more robustly via these two processes. Quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed algorithms significantly improve the raw pitch accuracy of our previous approach and are comparable with other state of the art approaches submitted to MIREX.;"Chao-Ling Hsu, ;Jyh-Shing Roger Jang, National Tsing Hua University, TWN, education";National Tsing Hua University, National Tsing Hua University;education, education;TWN, TWN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;24.132158;-14.241672

Typical music emotion classification (MEC) approaches apply machine learning methods to train a classifier based on audio features. In addition to audio features, the MIDI and lyrics features of music also contain useful semantic information for predicting the emotion of music. In this paper we apply AdaBoost algorithm to integrate MIDI, audio and lyrics information and propose a two-layer classifying strategy called Fusion by Subtask Merging for 4-class music emotion classification. We evaluate each modality respectively using SVM, and then combine any two of the three modalities, using AdaBoost algorithm (MIDI+audio, MIDI+lyrics, audio+lyrics). Moreover, integrating this in a multimodal system (MIDI+audio+lyrics) allows an improvement in the overall performance.

"Matthias Mauch;Simon Dixon";Approximate Note Transcription for the Improved Identification of Difficult Chords.;2010;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416598;The automatic detection and transcription of musical chords from audio is an established music computing task. The choice of chord proﬁles and higher-level time-series modelling have received a lot of attention, resulting in methods with an overall performance of more than 70% in the MIREX Chord Detection task 2009. Research on the front end of chord transcription algorithms has often concentrated on ﬁnding good chord templates to ﬁt the chroma features. In this paper we reverse this approach and seek to ﬁnd chroma features that are more suitable for usage in a musically-motivated model. We do so by performing a prior approximate transcription using an existing technique to solve non-negative least squares problems (NNLS). The resulting NNLS chroma features are tested by using them as an input to an existing state-of-the-art high-level model for chord transcription. We achieve very good results of 80% accuracy using the song collection and metric of the 2009 MIREX Chord Detection tasks. This is a signiﬁcant increase over the top result (74%) in MIREX 2009. The nature of some chords makes their identiﬁcation particularly susceptible to confusion between fundamental frequency and partials. We show that the recognition of these diffcult chords in particular is substantially improved by the prior approximate transcription using NNLS.;"Matthias Mauch, Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Digital Music, GBR, facility;Simon Dixon, Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Digital Music, GBR, facility";Queen Mary University of London, Queen Mary University of London;education, education;GBR, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;27.930769;-50.831234

As such DTW is unsuitable for real-time applications and is inefﬁcient for aligning long sequences.

We demonstrate this method in a score following application. Evaluation of the WTW score following system found 97.0% of audio note onsets were correctly aligned within 2000 ms of the known time.

The proposed system assumes a constant tempo and deals directly with the audio signal. A sliding window is applied to the signal and two feature classes are extracted. The first class is the log-energy of each band of a mel-scale triangular filterbank, a common feature vector used in various MIR applications. For the second class, a novel feature for the tempo induction task is presented; the strengths of the twelve western musical tones at all octaves are calculated for each audio frame, in a similar fashion with Pitch Class Profile. The time-evolving feature vectors are convolved with a bank of resonators, each resonator corresponding to a target tempo. Then the results of each feature class are combined to give the final output. The algorithm was evaluated on the popular ISMIR 2004 Tempo Induction Evaluation Exchange Dataset.

Especially in the case of expressive performances, current beat tracking approaches still have signiﬁcant problems to accurately capture local tempo deviations and beat positions. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation framework for detecting critical passages in a piece of music that are prone to tracking errors. Our idea is to look for consistencies in the beat tracking results over multiple performances of the same underlying piece. As another contribution, we further classify the critical passages by specifying musical properties of certain beats that frequently evoke tracking errors. Finally, considering three conceptually different beat tracking procedures, we conduct a case study on the basis of a challenging test set that consists of a variety of piano performances of Chopin Mazurkas.

To evaluate computer-based chord labeling procedures, one requires ground truth annotations for the underlying audio material. However, the manual generation of such annotations on the basis of audio recordings is tedious and time-consuming. On the other hand, trained musicians can easily derive chord labels from symbolic score data. In this paper, we bridge this gap by describing a procedure that allows for transferring annotations and chord labels from the score domain to the audio domain and vice versa. Using music synchronization techniques, the general idea is to locally warp the annotations of all given data streams onto a common time axis, which then allows for a cross-domain evaluation of the various types of chord labels. As a further contribution of this paper, we extend this principle by introducing a multi-perspective evaluation framework for simultaneously comparing chord recognition results over multiple performances of the same piece of music. The revealed inconsistencies in the results do not only indicate limitations of the employed chord labeling strategies but also deepen the understanding of the underlying music material.;"Verena Konz, Saarland University, DEU, education, MPI Informatik, DEU, facility;Meinard Müller, Saarland University, DEU, education, MPI Informatik, DEU, facility;Sebastian Ewert, University of Bonn, DEU, education";Saarland University, Saarland University, University of Bonn;education, education, education;DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;26.852036;-54.587437

For applications involving automatic classiﬁcation (e.g. speech/music discrimination, music genre or mood recognition, ...), traditional approaches will consider a large set of audio features to be extracted on a large dataset. In some cases, this will lead to computationally intensive systems and there is, therefore, a strong need for efﬁcient feature extraction. In this paper, a new audio feature extraction software, YAAFE 1 , is presented and compared to widely used libraries. The main advantage of YAAFE is a signiﬁcantly lower complexity due to the appropriate exploitation of redundancy in the feature calculation. YAAFE remains easy to conﬁgure and each feature can be parameterized independently.

It is based on five attributes extracted from the audio signal. They include music instrument, singing voice style, singer gender, tempo, and degree of noisiness. We compare the computed similarity measures with similarity scores obtained with subjective listening by over 200 human subjects. The results show that rhythm and mood related attributes like tempo and degree of noisiness are most correlated to human perception of Chinese pop songs. Instrument and singing style are relatively less relevant.

The performance of two existing algorithms and one of our own creation, called SIACT, is evaluated by comparison with this benchmark. SIACT out-performs the existing algorithms with regard to recall and, more often than not, precision. It is demonstrated that in all but the most carefully selected excerpts of music, the two existing algorithms can be affected by what is termed the ‘problem of isolated membership’.

Using a collection of lyrics and corresponding user-tagged moods, we build classifiers that classify lyrics of songs into moods. By comparing the performance of different mood frameworks (or dimensions), we examine to what extent the linguistic part of music reveals adequate information for assigning a mood category and which aspects of mood can be classified best. Our results show that word oriented metrics provide a valuable source of information for automatic mood classification of music, based on lyrics only. Metrics such as term frequencies and tf*idf values are used to measure relevance of words to the different mood classes. These metrics are incorporated in a machine learning classifier setup. Different partitions of the mood plane are investigated and we show that there is no large difference in mood prediction based on the mood division. Predictions on the valence, tension and combinations of aspects lead to similar performance.;"Menno van Zaanen, Tilburg University, NLD, education;Pieter Kanters, Tilburg University, NLD, education";Tilburg University, Tilburg University;education, education;NLD, NLD;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-21.002293;55.04714

The method supports the representation of abstract relations that are formed between notes that overlap in time without being simultaneous. Such relations are central to understanding species counterpoint. The method consists of an application of the vertical viewpoint technique, which relies on a vertical slicing of the musical score. It is applied to two-voice contrapuntal textures extracted from the Bach chorale harmonizations. Results show that the new method is powerful enough to represent and discover distinctive modules of species counterpoint, including remarkably the suspension principle of fourth species counterpoint. In addition, by focusing on two voices in particular and setting them against all other possible voice pairs, the method can elicit patterns that illustrate well the unique treatment of the voices under investigation, e.g. the inner and outer voices.

This technique has shown promising results in many areas of supervised classiﬁcation, in particular in the audio domain. However, feature generation is usually performed blindly, with genetic algorithms. As a result search performance is poor, thereby limiting its practical use. We propose a method to increase the search performance of feature generation systems. We focus on analytical features, i.e. features determined by their syntax. Our method consists in ﬁrst extracting statistical properties of the feature space called spin patterns, by analogy with statistical physics. We show that spin patterns carry information about the topology of the feature space. We exploit these spin patterns to guide a simulated annealing algorithm speciﬁcally designed for feature generation. We evaluate our approach on three audio classiﬁcation problems, and show that it increases performance by an order of magnitude.

The learned features perform significantly better than MFCCs. Moreover, we obtain a classification accuracy of 84.3% on the Tzanetakis dataset, which compares favorably against state-of-the-art genre classifiers using frame-based features.

Eric Humphrey;Automatic Characterization of Digital Music for Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation.;2010;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1418135;A computational rhythm analysis system is proposed to characterize the suitability of musical recordings for rhythmic auditory stimulation, a neurologic music therapy technique that uses rhythm to entrain periodic physical motion. Current applications of RAS are limited by the general inability to take advantage of the enormous amount of digital music that exists today. The system aims to identify motor-rhythmic music for the entrainment of neuromuscular activity for rehabilitation and exercise, motivating the concept of musical “use-genres.” This work builds upon prior research in meter and tempo analysis to establish a representation of rhythm chroma and alternatively describe beat spectra.;Eric Humphrey, University of Miami, USA, education;University of Miami;education;USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;41.39919;10.949941

We create an interactive system with visual and audio cues to assist users in the choosing of chords to craft an accompaniment in a desired style. We propose general measures for objectively evaluating the effectiveness and usability of such systems. We use melodies of existing songs by Radiohead as tests. Quantitative measures of musical distance – percentage correct and closely related chords, and average neo-Riemannian distance – compare the user-created accompaniment with the original, with and without decision support. Numbers of backward edits, unique chords explored, and repeated chord choices during composition help quantify composition behavior. We present experimental data from musicians and non-musicians. We observe that decision support reduces the time spent in composition, the number of revisions of earlier choices, redundant behavior such as repeated chord choices, and the gap between musicians’ and non-musicians’ work, without significantly limiting the range of users’ choices.;"Ching-Hua Chuan, University of North Florida, USA, education;Elaine Chew, University of Southern California, USA, education";University of North Florida, University of Southern California;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-26.177946;-22.45097

The choice of the HPSS algorithm was mainly based on the observation that the presence of harmonics causes the high MFCCs to be noisy. A multivariate autoregressive (MAR) model was trained on the improved MFCCs, and performance in the task of genre classification was evaluated. By combining features calculated on the separated signals, relative error rate reductions of 20% and 16.2% were obtained when an SVM classifier was trained on the MFCCs and MAR features respectively. Next, by analyzing the MAR features calculated on the separated signals, it was concluded that the original signal contained some information which the MAR model was capable of handling, and that the best performance was obtained when all three signals were used.

It is well known that each feature vector stemming from a union of independent linear subspaces admits a sparse representation with respect to a dictionary formed by all other feature vectors with nonzero coefficients associated only to feature vectors that stem from its own subspace. Such sparse representation reveals the relationships among the feature vectors and it is used to construct a similarity graph, the so-called ℓ1-graph. Accordingly, the segmentation of audio features is obtained by applying spectral clustering to the ℓ1-graph.

It is because of this dynamic nature that systems which seek to predict emotion in music must necessarily analyze such processes on short-time intervals, modeling not just the relationships between acoustic data and emotion parameters, but how those relationships evolve over time. In this work we seek to model such relationships using a conditional random field (CRF), a powerful graphical model which is trained to predict the conditional probability p(y|x) for a sequence of labels y given a sequence of features x. Treating our features as deterministic, we retain the rich local subtleties present in the data, which is especially applicable to content-based audio analysis, given the abundance of data in these problems. We train our graphical model on the emotional responses of individual annotators in an 11×11 quantized representation of the arousal-valence (A-V) space. Our model is fully connected, and can produce estimates of the conditional probability for each A-V bin, allowing us to easily model complex emotion-space distributions (e.g. multimodal) as an A-V heatmap.;"Erik M.

In this work, we compare the effectiveness of MoodSwings to that of a more traditional data collection method, where annotation is performed by single, paid annotators. We implement a simpliﬁed labeling task to run on Amazon’s crowdsourcing engine, Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and analyze the labels collected with each method.

This phenomenon is most striking in syncopated rhythms, found in many genres of music, including music of non-Western cultures. In general, syncopated rhythms may have energy at frequencies that do not correspond to perceived pulse or meter, and perceived metrical frequencies that are weak or absent in the objective rhythmic stimulus. In this paper, we consider syncopated rhythms that contain little or no energy at the pulse frequency. We used 16 rhythms (3 simple, 13 syncopated) to test a model of pulse/meter perception based on nonlinear resonance, comparing the nonlinear resonance model with a linear analysis. Both models displayed the ability to differentiate between duple and triple meters, however, only the nonlinear model exhibited resonance at the pulse frequency for the most challenging syncopated rhythms. This result suggests that nonlinear resonance may provide a viable approach to pulse detection in syncopated rhythms.;"Marc J. Velasco, Florida Atlantic University, USA, education;Edward W.

Our data is comprised of piano and vocal improvisations of musically trained performers, instructed to convey 4 categorical emotions. We applied Dynamic Texture Mixture (DTM), that models both the instantaneous sound qualities and their dynamics, and demonstrated the strength of the model.

A dynamic thresholding scheme is used to locate the potential positions of transients in the signal. The iterative procedure ensures that genuine transients are built up while the localised spectral noise are suppressed by using an energy criterion. The extracted transient signal is later compared to a ground truth dataset. The algorithm performed well on two databases. On the EBU-SQAM database of monophonic sounds, the algorithm achieved an F-measure of 90% while on our database of polyphonic audio an F-measure of 91% was achieved. This technique is being used as a preprocessing step for a tempo analysis algorithm and a TSR (Transients + Sines + Residue) decomposition scheme.;"Balaji Thoshkahna, Indian Institute of Science, IND, education;Francois Xavier Nsabimana, Fraunhofer Institute of Digital Media Technology, DEU, facility;K.R.Ramakrishnan, Indian Institute of Science, IND, education";Indian Institute of Science, Fraunhofer IDMT, Indian Institute of Science;education, facility, education;IND, DEU, IND;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developed economies, Developing economies;30.201635;17.518595

The proposed technique removes harmonic instrument leakages in the percussion enhanced outputs of the baseline algorithm. The technique uses median filtering and an adaptive detection of percussive segments in subbands followed by piecewise signal reconstruction using envelope properties to ensure that percussion is enhanced while harmonic leakages are suppressed. A new binary mask is created for the percussion signal which upon applying on the original signal improves harmonic versus percussion separation. We compare our algorithm with two recent techniques and show that on a database of polyphonic Indian music, the postprocessing algorithm improves the harmonic versus percussion decomposition significantly.;"Balaji Thoshkahna, Indian Institute of Science, IND, education;K.R.Ramakrishnan, Indian Institute of Science, IND, education";Indian Institute of Science, Indian Institute of Science;education, education;IND, IND;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;43.06541;-16.310972

We start by presenting autotagging experiments conducted with two different systems and show performances on a par with a method representative of the state-of-the-art. Beyond that, we illustrate via systematic experiments the importance of a number of issues relevant to autotagging, yet seldom reported in the literature. First, we show that the evaluation of autotagging techniques is fragile in the sense that small alterations to the set of tags to be learned, or in the set of music pieces may lead to dramatically different results. Hence we stress a set of methodological recommendations regarding data and evaluation metrics. Second, we conduct experiments on the generality of autotagging models, showing that a number of different methods at a similar performance level to the state-of-the-art fail to learn tag models able to generalize to datasets from different origins. Third we show that current performance level of a direct mapping between audio features and tags still appears insufficient to enable the possibility of exploiting natural tag correlations as a second stage to improve performance.;"Gonçalo Marques, DEETC-ISEL, PRT, education;Marcos Aurélio Domingues, INESC Porto, PRT, facility;Thibault Langlois, DI-FCUL, PRT, education;Fabien Gouyon, INESC Porto, PRT, facility";Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa, INESC, Universidade de Lisboa, INESC;education, facility, education, facility;PRT, PRT, PRT, PRT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-23.668417;33.75717

Persian music is based upon a set of seven major Dastgahs. The Dastgah in Persian music is similar to western musical scales and also Maqams in Turkish and Arabic music. Fuzzy logic type 2 as the basic part of our system has been used for modeling the uncertainty of tuning the scale steps of each Dastgah. The method assumes each performed note as a Fuzzy Set (FS), so each musical piece is a set of FSs. The maximum similarity between this set and theoretical data indicates the desirable Dastgah.

In particular, the supervised type of NMF is garnering much attention in source separation with respect to the analysis accuracy and speed. In this approach, a large number of spectral samples is used for analyzing a signal. If the system has a minimal number of samples, the accuracy deteriorates. Because such methods require all the possible samples for the analysis, it is hard to build a practical analysis system. To analyze signals properly even when short of samples, we propose a novel method that combines a supervised NMF and probabilistic search algorithms. In this approach, it is assumed that each instrumental category has a model-invariant feature called a probabilistic spectrum envelope (PSE). The algorithm starts with learning the PSEs of each category using a technique based on Gaussian Process Regression. Using the PSEs for spectrum generation, an observed spectrum is analyzed under the framework of a supervised NMF. The optimum spectrum can be searched by Genetic Algorithm using sparseness and density constraints.;"Toru Nakashika, Kobe University, JPN, education;Tetsuya Takiguchi, Kobe University, JPN, education;Yasuo Ariki, Kobe University, JPN, education";Kobe University, Kobe University, Kobe University;education, education, education;JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;6.8561645;-20.432217

The HCS is harmonically modulated sinusoids with the amplitudes defined by a set of codewords. The considered algorithm performs melody extraction in two steps: i) pitch-candidate estimation and ii) pitch-sequence identification. In the estimation step, pitch candidates are estimated such that the HCS best represents the polyphonic audio in the MMSE sense. In the identification step, a melody line is selected from many possible pitch sequences based on the properties of melody line. Posterior to the melody line selection, a smoothing process is applied to refine spurious pitches and octave errors.

We must cope with uncertainty in the audio signal generated from the score in a symbolic representation such as the variation in the timbre or temporal fluctuations. Existing audio-to-score alignment methods are sometimes vulnerable to the uncertainty in which multiple notes are simultaneously played with a variety of timbres because these methods rely on static observation models. For example, a chroma vector or a fixed harmonic structure template is used under the assumption that musical notes in a chord are all in the same volume and timbre. This paper presents a particle filter-based audio-to-score alignment method with a flexible observation model based on latent harmonic allocation. Our method adapts to the harmonic structure for the audio-to-score matching based on the observation of the audio signal through Bayesian inference.

Unlike standard music notation, the interpretations of each sign are ﬂexible and inﬂuenced by regional traditions, practices of given Jewish communities, larger musical inﬂuences beyond Jewish communities, and improvisatory elements incorporated by a given reader. In this paper we describe our collaborative work in developing and using computational tools to assess the stability of melodic formulas of cantillation signs based on two different performance traditions.

The clustering process is performed using expressive representations unambiguously notated on the musical score, without any arbitrariness by the human observer. The result of clustering is obtained as hierarchical tree structures for each deviational factor that occurred during the operation of the instrument. This structure represents an approximation of the performer’s interpretation with information notated on the score they used during the performance. This model represents the conditions that generate the difference in the ﬂuctuation of performance expression and the amounts of deviational factors directly from the data of real performance.

To overcome the fundamental limitations in conventional models—that the model optimality is not guaranteed, that the value of n is ﬁxed uniquely, and that a vocabulary of chord types (e.g., major, minor, · · · ) is deﬁned in an arbitrary way—we propose a vocabulary-free inﬁnity-gram model based on Bayesian nonparametrics. It accepts any combinations of notes as chord types and allows each chord appearing in a sequence to have an unbounded and variable-length context. All possibilities of n are taken into account when calculating the predictive probability of a next chord given a particular context, and when an unseen chord type emerges we can avoid out-of-vocabulary error by adaptively evaluating the 0-gram probability, i.e., the combinatorial probability of note components. Our experiments using Beatles songs showed that the predictive performance of the proposed model is better than that of the state-of-the-art models and that we could ﬁnd stochastically-coherent chord patterns by sorting variable-length n-grams in a line according to their generative probabilities.;"Kazuyoshi Yoshii, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;facility, facility;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;32.906128;-53.681606

Three of the features are based on the prior extraction of the predominant melody line, and have not been used in the context of vocal/instrumental activity detection. Using a support vector machine hidden Markov model we conduct 14 experiments to validate several combinations of our proposed features. Our results clearly demonstrate the benefit of combining the features: the best performance was always achieved by combining all four features. The top accuracy for vocal activity detection is 87.2%. The more difficult task of detecting instrumental solos equally benefits from the combination of all features and achieves an accuracy of 89.8% and a satisfactory precision of 61.1%.

Although various research-level interfaces and technologies have been developed, it has not been easy to get people to use them in everyday life. Songle serves as a showcase to demonstrate how people can benefit from music-understanding technologies by enabling people to experience active music listening interfaces on the web. Songle facilitates deeper understanding of music by visualizing music scene descriptions estimated automatically, such as music structure, hierarchical beat structure, melody line, and chords. When using music-understanding technologies, however, estimation errors are inevitable. Songle therefore features an efficient error correction interface that encourages people to contribute by correcting those errors to improve the web service. We also propose a mechanism of collaborative training for music-understanding technologies, in which corrected errors will be used to improve the music-understanding performance through machine learning techniques.

By only considering repeated segments of a song, our method can smooth the features without losing chord boundary information and ﬁne details of the original feature. While a similar existing technique requires several hard decisions such as beat quantization and segmentation, our method uses a simple pragmatic approach based on recurrence plot to decide which repeated parts to include in the smoothing process. This approach uses a more formal deﬁnition of the repetition search and allows shorter (“chord-size”) repeated segments to contribute to the feature improvement process. In our experiments, our method outperforms conventional and popular smoothing techniques (a moving average ﬁlter and a median ﬁlter).

It then trains an efficient encoder which quickly maps new inputs to approximations of their sparse representations using the learned dictionary. This avoids expensive iterative procedures usually required to infer sparse codes. We then use these sparse codes as inputs for a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM).

For semi-improvised music (e.g. jazz), this assumption is strongly violated. In this paper, we address the problem of aligning semi-improvised music audio with a lead sheet. Our approach does not require prior training on performances of the lead sheet to be aligned. We start by analyzing the problem and propose to represent the lead sheet as a MIDI file together with a structural information file. Then we propose a dynamic-programming-based system to align the chromagram representations of the audio performance and the MIDI score. Techniques are proposed to address the chromagram scaling, key transposition and structural change (e.g. a performer unexpectedly repeats a section) problems. We test our system on 3 jazz lead sheets. For each sheet we align a set of solo piano performances and a set of full-band commercial recordings with different instrumentation and styles.

These signals are analyzed and mapped to various musical features of the songs he listened to. A motif discovery algorithm used in data mining is adapted to analyze signals of physiological data. Motif discovery finds patterns in the data that indicate points of interest in the music.

Observations of musicologists studying historical recordings of classical music were conducted at the British Library. The observations show that the musicologists alternate between a closed listening practice, relying exclusively on aural observations, and a multimodal listening practice, where they interact with various music representations and information sources using different media (e.g. metadata about the recordings and performers, sound visualisations, scores, lyrics and performance videos). The spoken parts of broadcast recordings brought historical/extra-musical clues helping to understand music performance practices. Sound visualisation and computational methods fostered the analysis of speciﬁc musical expression patterns.

With many recordings being typically available for the same music piece, multiple expressive rendition variations of this piece are obtained, many of which are induced by the underlying musical content. In earlier work, we focused on timing as a means of expressivity, and proposed a light-weight, unsupervised and audio-based method to study timing deviations among different performances through alignment patterns. By using the standard deviation of alignment patterns as a measure for the display of individuality in a recording, structural and interpretational aspects of a music piece turned out to be highlighted in a qualitative case study on ﬁve Chopin mazurkas. In this paper, we propose an entropy-based deviation measure as an alternative to the existing standard deviation measure. The obtained results for multiple short-time window resolutions, both from a quantitative and qualitative perspective, strengthen our earlier ﬁnding that the found patterns are musically informative and conﬁrm that entropy is a good alternative measure for highlighting expressive timing deviations in recordings.;Cynthia C.S.

Secondly, we consider its simple reﬁnement by adding a minimum amount of genre metadata. We compare the proposed approaches with one content-based and three metadata-based baselines. As such, we consider content-based approach working on inferred semantic descriptors, a tag-based recommender exploiting artist tags, a commercial black-box recommender partially employing collaborative ﬁltering information, and a simple genre-based random recommender. We conduct a listening experiment with 19 participants. The obtained results reveal that although the low-level/semantic content-based approach does not achieve the performance of the baseline working exclusively on the inferred semantic descriptors, the proposed reﬁnement provides signiﬁcant improvement in the listeners’ satisfaction comparable with metadata-based approaches, and surpasses these approaches by the number of novel relevant recommendations.

A statistical analysis of the ties showed that these adolescents relied mostly on strong ties to expand their music repertoire, that is, on people to which they felt very close and with whom they had frequent contacts. These ties were predominantly homophilous in terms of age, gender and musical taste. It was also found that parents were more likely than friends or other types of kins to be instrumental for music discovery. These findings suggest that a better knowledge of the characteristics of the ties through which people discover new music could provide useful insights for the design of recommender systems that include social networking features.;Audrey Laplante, École de bibliothéconomie et des sciences de l’information, Université de Montréal, CAN, education;Université de Montréal;education;CAN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-37.775093;31.498592

To go beyond the simple extraction of all time intervals between onsets (noteson extraction), we select notes according to their length (short and long extractions) or their intensities (intensity+/− extractions). Once the rhythm is extracted, we use dynamic programming to compare several sequences. We report results of analysis on the size of rhythm patterns that are specific to a unique piece, as well as experiments on similarity queries (ragtime music and Bach chorale variations). These results show that long and intensity+ extractions are often good choices for rhythm extraction. Our conclusions are that, even from polyphonic symbolic music, rhythm alone can be enough to identify a piece or to perform pertinent music similarity queries, especially when using wise rhythm extractions.;"Florence Levé, Richard Groult, Guillaume Arnaud, Cyril Séguin, Université de Picardie Jules Verne, FRA, education;Rémi Gaymay, Mathieu Giraud, Université Lille 1, CNRS, FRA, education";Université de Picardie Jules Verne,Université de Picardie Jules Verne,Université de Picardie Jules Verne,Université de Picardie Jules Verne, Université de Lille, Université de Lille;education, education, education, education, education, education;FRA, FRA, FRA, FRA, FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;0.11061059;-10.761101

Several efforts were set out to develop and provide the necessary infrastructure, technology and methodologies to carry out these evaluations, out of which the annual Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange emerged. The community as a whole has enormously gained from this evaluation forum, but very little attention has been paid to reliability and correctness issues.

The use of different statistical procedures does improve the reliability of the results, and it allows using as little as half the number of queries currently used in MIREX evaluations while still offering very similar reliability levels.

In this paper, we consider the task of separating a monaural piano recording into two sound sources (or voices) that correspond to the left hand and the right hand. Since in this scenario the two sources share many physical properties, sound separation approaches identifying sources based on their spectral envelope are hardly applicable. Instead, we propose a score-informed approach, where explicit note events specified by the score are used to parameterize the spectrogram of a given piano recording. This parameterization then allows for constructing two spectrograms considering only the notes of the left hand and the right hand, respectively. Finally, inversion of the two spectrograms yields the separation result. First experiments show that our approach, which involves high-resolution music synchronization and parametric modeling techniques, yields good results for real-world non-synthetic piano recordings.;"Sebastian Ewert, University of Bonn, DEU, education;Meinard Müller, Saarland University and MPI Informatik, DEU, education";University of Bonn, Saarland University;education, education;DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;38.499718;-17.234789

Unfortunately, hand-annotating music with mood tags is usually an expensive, time-consuming and subjective process, to such an extent that automatic mood recognition methods are required. In this paper we present a new unsupervised learning approach for mood recognition, based on the lyrics and the audio of a song. Our system thus eliminates the need for ground truth mood annotations, even for training the system. We hypothesize that lyrics and audio are both partially determined by the mood, and that there are no other strong common effects affecting these aspects of music. Based on this assumption, mood can be detected by performing a multi-modal analysis, identifying what lyrics and audio have in common. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this using Canonical Correlation Analysis, and conﬁrm our hypothesis in a subsequent analysis of the results.;"Matt McVicar, University of Bristol, GBR, education;Tim Freeman, University of Bristol, GBR, education;Tijl De Bie, University of Bristol, GBR, education";University of Bristol, University of Bristol, University of Bristol;education, education, education;GBR, GBR, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-19.684639;53.94168

Once songs are represented as a BoS histogram over codewords, traditional algorithms for text document retrieval can be leveraged for music auto-tagging. Compared to estimating a single generative model to directly capture the musical characteristics of songs associated with a tag, the BoS approach offers the flexibility to combine different classes of generative models at various time resolutions through the selection of the BoS codewords.

We use three computational measures to gauge lyrics creativity: Type-to-Token Ratio, word norms fraction, and WordNet similarity. We then test three hypotheses regarding differences in lyrics creativity between music with different moods on 2715 U.S. rock songs. The three measures led to consistent findings that lyrics of negative and sad songs demonstrate higher linguistic creativity than those of positive and happy songs. Our findings support previous studies in psycholinguistics that people write more creatively when the text conveys sad or negative sentiment, and contradict previous research that positive mood triggers more unusual word associations.

In the clinical setting, care providers can suffer from alarm fatigue, a condition in which audible alarms in an operating room are perceived as a nuisance. In this study, we explore the auditory features associated with current audible alarms using tools from the music information retrieval community, and then we examine how those auditory features correlate to listeners’ perception of urgency. The results show that aperiodic changes in the auditory spectrum over time are the most salient contributor to the perception of urgency in sound.

Ching-Hua Chuan;A Comparison of Statistical and Rule-Based Models for Style-Specific Harmonization.;2011;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417365;The process of generating chords for harmonizing a melody with the goal of mimicking an artist’s style is investigated in this paper. We compared and tested three different approaches, including a rule-based model, a statistical model, and a hybrid system of the two, for such tasks. Experiments were conducted using songs from seven stylistically identifiable pop/rock bands, and the chords generated by the systems were compared to the ones in the artists’ original work. Evaluations were performed on multiple aspects, including calculating the average percentage of chords that were the same and those that were related, studying the manner in which the size of the training set affects the output harmonization, and examining a system’s behaviors in terms of the ability of generating unseen chords and the number of unique chords produced per song. We observed that the rule-based system performs comparably well while the result of the system with learning capability varies as the training set grows.;Ching-Hua Chuan, University of North Florida, USA, education;University of North Florida;education;USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-11.16474;-23.574469

Robotic instruments that generate sound acoustically using actuators have been increasingly developed and used in performances and compositions over the past 10 years. Although such devices can be very sophisticated mechanically, in most cases they are passive devices that directly respond to control messages from a computer. In the few cases where more sophisticated control and feedback is employed it is in the form of simple mappings with little musical understanding. Several techniques for extracting musical information have been proposed in the ﬁeld of music information retrieval. In most cases the focus has been the batch processing of large audio collections rather than real time performance understanding. In this paper we describe how such techniques can be adapted to deal with some of the practical problems we have experienced in our own work with music robotics. Of particular importance is the idea of self-awareness or proprioception in which the robot(s) adapt their behavior based on understanding the connection between their actions and sound generation through listening.

One limitation of the current design of AMS is that evaluators are provided with scarce contextual information as to why they are evaluating the similarity of the songs and how this information will be used. This study explores the potential use of AMS results for generating playlists based on similarity. We asked participants to listen to a subset of results from the 2010 AMS task and evaluate the set of candidates generated by the algorithms as a playlist generated from a seed song (the query). We found that while similarity does affect how people feel about the candidate set as a playlist, other factors such as variety, metadata, personal preference, familiarity, mix of familiar and new music, etc. also strongly affect users' perceptions of playlist quality as well.

We evaluate HARMTRACE and three other harmonic similarity measures on a corpus of 5,028 chord sequences that contains harmonically related pieces.

David Meredith;A Geometric Language for Representing Structure in Polyphonic Music.;2012;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1414736;In 1981, Deutsch and Feroe proposed a formal language for representing melodic pitch structure that employed the powerful concept of hierarchically-related pitch alphabets. However, neither rhythmic structure nor pitch structure in polyphonic music can be adequately represented using this language. A new language is proposed here that incorporates certain features of Deutsch and Feroe’s model but extends and generalises it to allow for the representation of both rhythm and pitch structure in polyphonic music. The new language adopts a geometric approach in which a passage of polyphonic music is represented as a set of multi-dimensional points, generated by performing transformations on component patterns. The language introduces the concept of a periodic mask, a generalisation of Deutsch and Feroe’s notion of a pitch alphabet, that can be applied to any dimension of a geometric representation, allowing for both rhythms and pitch collections to be represented parsimoniously in a uniform way.;David Meredith, Aalborg University, DNK, education;Aalborg University;education;DNK;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;10.454661;-17.808512

This paper attempts to answer this question through a comparative study on English and Chinese songs. Specifically, a set of Chinese pop songs were annotated using an existing mood taxonomy developed for English songs. Six sets of audio features commonly used on Western music (e.g., timbre, rhythm) were extracted from both Chinese and English songs, and mood classification performances based on these feature sets were compared. In addition, experiments were conducted to test the generalizability of classification models across English and Chinese songs. Results of this study shed light on cross-cultural applicability of research results on music mood classification.;"Yi-Hsuan Yang, Academia Sinica, TWN, facility;Xiao Hu, University of Denver, USA, education";Academia Sinica, University of Denver;facility, education;TWN, USA;FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developed economies;-20.893497;51.388374
"Yannis Panagakis;Constantine Kotropoulos";Music Structure Analysis by Ridge Regression of Beat-synchronous Audio Features.;2012;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417059;A novel unsupervised method for automatic music structure analysis is proposed. Three types of audio features, namely the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, the chroma features, and the auditory temporal modulations are employed in order to form beat-synchronous feature sequences modeling the audio signal. Assume that the feature vectors from each segment lie in a subspace and the song as a whole occupies the union of several subspaces. Then any feature vector can be represented as a linear combination of the feature vectors stemming from the same subspace. The coefficients of such a linear combination are found by solving an appropriate ridge regression problem, resulting to the ridge representation (RR) of the audio features. The RR yields an affinity matrix with nonzero within-subspace affinities and zero between-subspace ones, revealing the structure of the music recording. The segmentation of the feature sequence into music segments is found by applying the normalized cuts algorithm to the RR-based affinity matrix. In the same context, the combination of multiple audio features is investigated as well. The proposed method is referred to as ridge regression-based music structure analysis (RRMSA). State-of-the-art performance is reported for the RRMSA by conducting experiments on the manually annotated Beatles benchmark dataset.;"Yannis Panagakis, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GRC, education;Constantine Kotropoulos, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GRC, education";Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki;education, education;GRC, GRC;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;4.3036346;6.7228823

In a scape plot, each point corresponds to an audio segment identified by its center and length. As our main contribution, we assign to each point a color value so that two segment properties become apparent. Firstly, we use the lightness component of the color to indicate the repetitiveness of the encoded segment, where we revert to a recently introduced fitness measure. Secondly, we use the hue component of the color to reveal the relations between different segments. To this end, we introduce a novel grouping procedure that automatically maps related segments to similar hue values.

But for a specific audio version of a given piece of music, the novelty detection result may also crucially depend on the individual performance style of the musician. This particularly holds true for tempo-related properties, which may vary significantly across different performances of the same piece of music. In this paper, we show that tempo-based novelty detection can be stabilized and improved by simultaneously analyzing a set of different performances. We first warp the version-dependent novelty curves onto a common musical time axis, and then combine the individual curves to produce a single fusion curve. Our hypothesis is that musically relevant points of novelty tend to be consistent across different performances. This hypothesis is supported by our experiments in the context of music structure analysis, where the cross-version fusion curves yield, on average, better results than the novelty curves obtained from individual recordings.;"Meinard Müller, Bonn University, DEU, education, MPI Informatik, DEU, facility;Thomas Prätzlich, Saarland University, DEU, education, MPI Informatik, DEU, facility;Jonathan Driedger, Bonn University, DEU, education, Saarland University, DEU, education";University of Bonn, Saarland University, University of Bonn;education, education, education;DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;47.327118;12.979947

The mid-level representation is designed to capture an approximation to the musical events present in the printed score. It consists of a template based note detection frontend that seeks to detect notes without regard to musical duration, accidentals or the key signature. The presented method is designed for the commonly used grand staff and the approach is extendable to other types of scores. The image processing consists of page segmentation into lines followed by multiple stages that optimally orient the lines and establish a reference grid to be used in the note identification stage. Both the audio and the printed score are converted into compatible frequency representations. Alignment is performed using dynamic time warping with a specially designed distance measure. The insufficient pitch resolution due to the reductive nature of the mid-level representation is compensated by this pitch tolerant distance measure. Evaluation is carried out at the beat level using annotated scores and audio. The results demonstrate that the approach provides an efficient and practical alternative to methods that rely on symbolic MIDI-like information through OMR methods for alignment.;"Özgür İzmirli, Connecticut College, USA, education;Gyanendra Sharma, Connecticut College, USA, education";Connecticut College, Connecticut College;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-14.633433;-35.186123

In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for generating coherent playlists by embedding songs and social tags in a unified metric space. We show how the embedding can be learned from example playlists, providing the metric space with a probabilistic meaning for song/song, song/tag, and tag/tag distances. This enables at least three types of inference. First, our models can generate new playlists, outperforming conventional n-gram models in terms of predictive likelihood by orders of magnitude. Second, the learned tag embeddings provide a generalizing representation for embedding new songs, allowing it to create playlists even for songs it has never observed in training. Third, we show that the embedding space provides an effective metric for matching songs to natural-language queries, even if tags for a large fraction of the songs are missing.;"Joshua L.

Much of the difficulty in developing emotion-based features is the ambiguity of the ground-truth. Even using the smallest time window, opinions about emotion are bound to vary and reflect some disagreement between listeners. In previous work, we have modeled human response labels to music in the arousal-valence (A-V) emotion space with time-varying stochastic distributions. Current methods for automatic detection of emotion in music seek performance increases by combining several feature domains (e.g. loudness, timbre, harmony, rhythm). Such work has focused largely in dimensionality reduction for minor classification performance gains, but has provided little insight into the relationship between audio and emotional associations. In this work, we seek to employ regression-based deep belief networks to learn features directly from magnitude spectra. Taking into account the dynamic nature of music, we investigate combining multiple timescales of aggregated magnitude spectra as a basis for feature learning.;"Erik M.

We ﬁnd that such a system recognizes chords at a level consistent with the state-of-the-art systems – 84.23% on Uspop dataset at the major/minor level. The duration distribution is estimated from chord duration histograms on the training data. It is found that the state-of-the-art recognition result can be improved upon by using several duration distributions, which are found automatically by clustering song-level duration histograms. The paper further describes experiments which shed light on the extent to which context information, in the sense of transition matrices, is useful for the audio chord recognition task. We present evidence that the context provides surprisingly little improvement in performance, compared to isolated frame-wise recognition with simple smoothing. We discuss possible reasons for this, such as the inherent entropy of chord sequences in our training database.;"Ruofeng Chen, Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology, USA, facility;Weibin Shen, Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology, USA, facility;Ajay Srinivasamurthy, Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology, USA, facility;Parag Chordia, Smule Inc., USA, company";Georgia Institute of Technology,Georgia Institute of Technology,Georgia Institute of Technology, Smule Inc;education, education, education, company;USA, USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;29.629816;-55.288937

Features used for classiﬁcation were the time series of the partial tone amplitudes, and of the MFCCs, and the energy distribution of the nontonal percussive sound that is produced in the attack phase of the tone. Furthermore the inﬂuence of sound parameters as timbre, player, fret position and string number on the recognition rate is investigated. Finally, several nonlinear kernels are compared in their classiﬁcation performance. It turns out, that a selection of 505 features out of the full feature set of 1155 elements does only reduce the recognition rate of a linear SVM from 82% to 78%. With the use of a polynomial instead of a linear kernel the recognition rate with the reduced feature set can even be increased to 84%.;"Wolfgang Fohl, HAW Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, DEU, education;Ivan Turkalj, HAW Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, DEU, education;Andreas Meisel, HAW Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, DEU, education";Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, Hamburg University of Applied Sciences;education, education, education;DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;6.2134533;28.981281

The motifs, or key phrases, provide strong cues to the identity of the underlying raga in both Hindustani and Carnatic styles of Indian music. Thus the automatic detection of such recurring basic melodic shapes from audio is of relevance in music information retrieval. The extraction of melodic attributes from polyphonic audio and the variability inherent in the performance, which does not follow a predefined score, make the task particularly challenging. In this work, we consider the segmentation of selected melodic motifs from audio signals by computing similarity measures on time series of automatically detected pitch values. The methods are investigated in the context of detecting the signature phrase of Hindustani vocal music compositions (bandish) within and across performances.;"Joe Cheri Ross, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education;Vinutha T.

A small number of different expressive timing behaviors (constant, slowing down, speeding up, accent) are deﬁned in order to explain the tempo discretely. Given a MIDI performance of a piano music, we simultaneously estimate both discrete variables that corresponds to the behaviors and continuous variables that describe tempo. A graphical model is introduced to represent the evolution of the discrete behaviors and tempo progression. We demonstrate a computational method that acquires the approximate most likely conﬁguration of the discrete behaviors and the hidden continuous variable tempo. This conﬁguration represent a “smoothed” version of the performance which greatly reduces parametrization while retaining most of its musicality.

First, manual annotations by a trained user on a dedicated graphical user interface are shown to provide satisfactory performance although they are prone to errors. Second, we investigate simple learning strategies to predict the Wiener coefﬁcients based on local information around a given time-frequency bin of the spectrogram.

The use of signal enhancement as a pre-processing step has led to limited improvement though, because distortions inevitably remain in the enhanced signals that may propagate to the subsequent feature extraction and classiﬁcation stages. Previous studies attempting to reduce the impact of these distortions have relied on the use of feature weighting or missing feature theory. Based on advances in the ﬁeld of noise-robust speech recognition, we represent the uncertainty about the enhanced signals via a Gaussian distribution instead that is subsequently propagated to the features and to the classiﬁer. We introduce new methods to estimate the uncertainty from the signal in a fully automatic manner and to learn the classiﬁer directly from polyphonic data.

Each harmonic sound is assumed to emit a large number of sound quanta over the time-log-frequency domain. The observation probability is expressed as the product of two Gaussian mixtures. The number of quanta is calculated in the ϵ-neighborhood of each grid point on the spectrogram. BNHTF integrates latent harmonic allocation (LHA) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to estimate both the observation probability and the number of quanta. The model is optimized by newly designed deterministic procedures with several approximations for the variational Bayesian inference. Results of experiments on multipitch estimation with 40 musical pieces showed that BNHTF outperforms the conventional method by 0.018 in terms of F-measure on average.;"Daichi Sakaue, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Takuma Otsuka, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Katsutoshi Itoyama, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Hiroshi G.

These models are nonparametric Bayesian extensions of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) based on the source-ﬁlter paradigm, and in them an amplitude or power spectrogram is decomposed as the product of two kinds of spectral atoms (sources and ﬁlters) and time-varying gains of source-ﬁlter pairs. In this study we model musical instruments as autoregressive systems that combine two types of sources—periodic signals (comb-shaped densities) and white noise (ﬂat density)—with all-pole ﬁlters representing resonance characteristics. One of the main problems with such composite autoregressive models (CARMs) is that the numbers of sources and ﬁlters should be given in advance. To solve this problem, we propose nonparametric Bayesian models based on gamma processes and efﬁcient variational and multiplicative learning algorithms. These inﬁnite CARMs (iCARMs) can discover appropriate numbers of sources and ﬁlters in a data-driven manner.

"Zafar Rafii;Bryan Pardo";Music/Voice Separation Using the Similarity Matrix.;2012;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417631;Repetition is a fundamental element in generating and perceiving structure in music. Recent work has applied this principle to separate the musical background from the vocal foreground in a mixture, by simply extracting the underlying repeating structure. While existing methods are effective, they depend on an assumption of periodically repeating patterns. In this work, we generalize the repetition-based source separation approach to handle cases where repetitions also happen intermittently or without a fixed period, thus allowing the processing of music pieces with fast-varying repeating structures and isolated repeating elements. Instead of looking for periodicities, the proposed method uses a similarity matrix to identify the repeating elements. It then calculates a repeating spectrogram model using the median and extracts the repeating patterns using a time-frequency masking. Evaluation on a data set of 14 full-track real-world pop songs showed that use of a similarity matrix can overall improve on the separation performance compared with a previous repetition-based source separation method, and a recent competitive music/voice separation method, while still being computationally efficient.;"Zafar RAFII, Northwestern University, USA, education;Bryan PARDO, Northwestern University, USA, education";Northwestern University, Northwestern University;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;39.068523;-18.589483

Whilst an approximation to the tempo can be calculated from the inter-beat interval, the annotations also include timing variations due to expressively timed events, phase shifts and errors in the annotation times. These deviations tend to propagate into the tempo graph and so tempo analysis methods tend to average over recent inter-beat intervals. However, whilst this minimises the effect such timing deviations have on the local tempo estimate, it also obscures the expressive timing devices used by the performer.

Current methods commonly use similarity metrics based on Mel-frequency cepstral coefﬁcients (MFCCs), which are derived from the objective frequency spectrum of a sound. We follow this approach, but use the level-dependent auditory spectrum, evaluated using the loudness models of Glasberg and Moore, at three listening levels, to produce auditory spectrum cepstral coefﬁcients (ASCCs). The ASCCs are used to generate sets of playlists at each listening level, using a typical method, and these playlists were found to differ greatly.

Approaches to the analysis of rhythm in music information retrieval to date have focussed on low-level features for retrieval or on the detection of tempo, beats and drums in audio recordings. Musicological approaches are usually concerned with the description or implementation of manmade music theories. In this paper, we present a quantitative bottom-up approach to the study of rhythm that relies upon well-understood statistical methods from natural language processing. We adapt these methods to our corpus of music, based on the realisation that—unlike words—barlength drum patterns can be systematically decomposed into sub-patterns both in time and by instrument. We show that, in some respects, our rhythm corpus behaves like natural language corpora, particularly in the sparsity of vocabulary. The same methods that detect word collocations allow us to quantify and rank idiomatic combinations of drum patterns. In other respects, our corpus has properties absent from language corpora, in particular, the high amount of repetition and strong mutual information rates between drum instruments. Our ﬁndings may be of direct interest to musicians and musicologists, and can inform the design of ground truth corpora and computational models of musical rhythm.;"Matthias Mauch, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, facility;Simon Dixon, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, facility";Queen Mary University of London,Queen Mary University of London;education, education;GBR, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;40.14001;19.891537

Previous research has shown that musical mood is linked to features based on rhythm, timbre, spectrum and lyrics. For example, sad music correlates with slow tempo, while happy music is generally faster. However, only limited success has been obtained in learning automatic classiﬁers of emotion in music. In this paper, we collect a ground truth data set of 2904 songs that have been tagged with one of the four words “happy”, “sad”, “angry” and “relaxed”, on the Last.FM web site. An excerpt of the audio is then retrieved from 7Digital.com, and various sets of audio features are extracted using standard algorithms. Two classiﬁers are trained using support vector machines with the polynomial and radial basis function kernels, and these are tested with 10-fold cross validation. Our results show that spectral features outperform those based on rhythm, dynamics, and, to a lesser extent, harmony.

In this paper we analyse limitations of current methods and identify promising directions for future research. Current transcription methods use general purpose models which are unable to capture the rich diversity found in music signals. In order to overcome the limited performance of transcription systems, algorithms have to be tailored to speciﬁc use-cases. Semiautomatic approaches are another way of achieving a more reliable transcription.

There are two main contributions of this paper in the rhythm analysis field. Firstly, a novel technique is proposed to code the rhythm periodicity functions of a music signal. Target tempi range is divided into overlapping “tempo bands” and the periodicity function is filtered by triangular masks aligned to those tempo bands, in order to calculate the respective saliencies, followed by the application of the DCT transform on band strengths. The second contribution is the adoption of Support Vector Machines to learn broad tempo classes from the coded periodicity vectors. Training instances are assigned a tempo class according to annotated tempo. The classes are assumed to correspond to “music speed”. At classification phase, each target excerpt is assigned a tempo class label by the SVM. Target periodicity vector is masked by the predicted tempo class range, and tempo is estimated by peak picking in the reduced periodicity vector. The proposed method was evaluated on the benchmark ISMIR 2004 Tempo Induction Evaluation Exchange Dataset for both tempo class and tempo value estimation tasks.

However, in the music notation model proposed by the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI), the hierarchy of the XML sub-tree representing the music emphasizes the content rather than the layout. Since systems and pages do not coincide with the musical content, they are encoded in a secondary hierarchy that contains very limited information.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of structure fingerprints, which are compact descriptors of the musical structure of an audio recording. Given a recorded music performance, structure fingerprints facilitate the retrieval of other performances sharing the same underlying structure. Avoiding any explicit determination of musical structure, our fingerprints can be thought of as a probability density function derived from a self-similarity matrix. We show that the proposed fingerprints can be compared by using simple Euclidean distances without using any kind of complex warping operations required in previous approaches.

Specifically, we refine this process by using word alignment tools developed for statistical machine translation, and we also use a much larger set of chord annotations. In addition, objective evaluation measures are included. Thus, this work validates a novel application of lexicon induction techniques over parallel corpora to a domain outside of natural language learning. To confirm the associations commonly attributed to major versus minor chords (i.e., happy and sad, respectively), we compare the inferred word associations against synonyms reflecting this dichotomy. To evaluate meanings associated with chord sequences, we check how often tagged chords occur in songs labeled with the same overall meaning.;"Tom O’Hara, Texas State University, USA, education;Nico Schüler, Texas State University, USA, education;Yijuan Lu, Texas State University, USA, education;Dan E.

While makams are defined with various characteristics including a distinct set of pitches, pitch hierarchy, melodic direction, typical phrases and typical makam transitions, such characteristics result in certain n-gram distributions which can be used for makam detection effectively. 13 popular makams, some of which are very similar to each other, are used in this study. Using the leave-one-out strategy, makam models are created statistically and tested against the left out music piece. Tests indicate that n-gram based statistical modeling and perplexity based similarity metric can be effectively used for makam detection. However the main dimension that cannot be captured is the overall progression which is the most unique feature for classification of close makams that uses the same scale notes as well as the same tonic.;"Erdem Ünal, TÜBİTAK-BİLGEM, TUR, facility;Barış Bozkurt, Bahçeşehir University, TUR, education;M.

An existing computational method for the representation of pitch contours is brieﬂy reviewed. Its application to music analysis is exempliﬁed with two pieces of non-notated music: a ﬁeld recording of a folkloric form of polyphonic singing and a commercial recording by a noted blues musician. Both examples have vocal parts exhibiting complex pitch evolution, difﬁcult to analyze and notate with precision using Western common music notation. By using novel time-frequency analysis techniques that improve the location of the components of a harmonic sound, the melodic content representation implemented here allows a detailed study of aspects related to pitch intonation and tuning. This in turn permits an objective measurement of essential musical characteristics that are difﬁcult or impossible to properly evaluate by subjective perception alone, and which are often not accounted for in traditional musicological analysis.

We shed some light on the complex nature of syncopation by looking into MIDI data from drum loops and whole songs.

We focus on the procedures and collections currently used as part of the annual Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX), which has become the de-facto benchmark for evaluating and comparing melody extraction algorithms. We study several factors: the duration of the audio clips, time offsets in the ground truth annotations, and the size and musical content of the collection. The results show that the clips currently used are too short to predict performance on full songs, highlighting the paramount need to use complete musical pieces. Concerning the ground truth, we show how a minor error, specifically a time offset between the annotation and the audio, can have a dramatic effect on the results, emphasizing the importance of establishing a common protocol for ground truth annotation and system output. We also show that results based on the small ADC04, MIREX05 and INDIAN08 collections are unreliable, while the MIREX09 collections are larger than necessary. This evidences the need for new and larger collections containing realistic music material, for reliable and meaningful evaluation of Audio Melody Extraction.;"Justin Salamon, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain, education;Julián Urbano, University Carlos III of Madrid, Leganés, Spain, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra , University Carlos III of Madrid;education, education;ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;18.462093;-14.921767

However, tag descriptions present some drawbacks such as tag scarcity or concept inconsistencies. In these situations, tag recommendation strategies can help users in adding meaningful tags to the resources being described. Freesound is an online audio clip sharing site that uses collaborative tagging to describe a collection of more than 140,000 sound samples. In this paper we propose four algorithm variants for tag recommendation based on tag co-occurrence in the Freesound folksonomy. On the basis of removing a number of tags that have to be later predicted by the algorithms, we ﬁnd that using ranks instead of raw tag similarities produces statistically signiﬁcant improvements. Moreover, we show how speciﬁc strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can signiﬁcantly improve algorithms’ performance. These two aspects provide insight into some of the most basic components of tag recommendation systems, and we plan to exploit them in future real-world deployments.;"Frederic Font, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Joan Serr`a, Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (IIIA-CSIC), ESP, facility;Xavier Serra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, facility, education;ESP, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-22.705406;37.268017

In this paper we approach the description of intonation from a computational perspective, obtaining a compact representation of the pitch track of a recording. First, we extract pitch contours from automatically selected voice segments. Then, we obtain a a pitch histogram of its full pitch-range, normalized by the tonic frequency, from which each prominent peak is automatically labelled and parametrized. We validate such parametrization by considering an explorative classification task: three raagas are disambiguated using the characterization of a single peak (a task that would seriously challenge a more naïve parametrization). Results show consistent improvements for this particular task. Furthermore, we perform a qualitative assessment on a larger collection of raagas, showing the discriminative power of the entire representation. The proposed generic parametrization of the intonation histogram should be useful for musically relevant tasks such as performer and instrument characterization.;"Gopala K.

In this paper we propose a methodology for extracting music-related semantic information from an online discussion forum, rasikas.org, dedicated to the Carnatic music tradition. We first define a dictionary of relevant terms within categories such as raagas, taalas, performers, composers, and instruments, and create a complex network representation by matching such dictionary against the forum posts. This network representation is used to identify popular terms within the forum, as well as relevant co-occurrences and semantic relationships. This way, for instance, we are able to learn the instrument played by a performer with 95% accuracy, to discover the confusion between two raagas with different naming conventions, or to infer semantic relationships regarding lineage or musical influence.

Then we conduct a listening test using a subset of the Million Song Dataset to establish a threshold which results in acceptable quality of the chosen beat output. For both datasets, we obtain a percentage of trackable music of about 73%, and we investigate which data tags are related to acceptable and problematic beat tracking.

In order to further improve the results, we evaluated the use of a complex source separation as a pre-step.

The first strategy extracts the f0 from salient pitch contours computed from the mixed spectrum; the second separates the voice from the guitar and then performs monophonic f0 estimation. We integrate both approaches with an automatic transcription system, which first estimates the tuning frequency and then implements an iterative strategy for note segmentation and labeling. We evaluate them on a flamenco music collection, including a wide range of singers and recording conditions. Both strategies achieve satisfying results. The separation-based approach yields a good overall accuracy (76.81%), although instrumental segments have to be manually located. The predominant f0 estimator yields slightly higher accuracy (79.72%) but does not require any manual annotation. Furthermore, its accuracy increases (84.68%) if we adapt some algorithm parameters to each analyzed excerpt. Most transcription errors are due to incorrect f0 estimations (typically octave and voicing errors in strong presence of guitar) and incorrect note segmentation in highly ornamented sections.

These methods typically use dynamic programming to align the shared musical motifs between subparts of two recordings. Such music local alignment methods are slow, as are the bioinformatics algorithms they are closely related to. We have adapted the ideas of the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) for biosequence alignment to the domain of aligning sequences of chroma features. Our tool allows local music sequence alignment in near-linear time. It identifies small regions of exact match between sequences, called seeds, and builds local alignments that include these seeds. Seed determination is a key issue for the accuracy of the method and closely depends on the database, the representation and the application. We introduce a particular seeding approach for cover detection, and evaluate it on both a 2000-piece training set and the million song dataset (MSD). We show that the heuristic alignment drastically improves time computation for cover song detection. Alignment sensitivity is still very high on the small database, but is dramatically weakened on the MSD, due to differences in chroma features.

We propose an algorithm to retrieve episodes in the fugues of the first book of Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavier, starting from a symbolic score which is already track-separated. The algorithm does not use any information on subject or counter-subject occurrences, but tries to detect partial harmonic sequences, that is similar pitch contour in at least two voices. For this, it uses a substitution function considering “quantized partially overlapping intervals” [14] and a strict length matching for all notes, except for the first and the last one.

For various music information retrieval tasks, one would benefit from modelling both low and high level aspects in a unified feature extraction framework.

However, there has been no systematic analysis regarding how well these evaluation results translate into real-world user satisfaction. For most researchers, reaching statistical signiﬁcance in the evaluation results is usually the most important goal, but in this paper we show that indicators of statistical signiﬁcance (i.e., small p-value) are eventually of secondary importance. Researchers who want to predict the realworld implications of formal evaluations should properly report upon practical signiﬁcance (i.e., large effect-size). Using data from the 18 systems submitted to the MIREX 2011 Audio Music Similarity and Retrieval task, we ran an experiment with 100 real-world users that allows us to explicitly map system performance onto user satisfaction. Based upon 2,200 judgments, the results show that absolute system performance needs to be quite large for users to be satisﬁed, and differences between systems have to be very large for users to actually prefer the supposedly better system. The results also suggest a practical upper bound of 80% on user satisfaction with the current deﬁnition of the task.

"Eric Battenberg;David Wessel";Analyzing Drum Patterns Using Conditional Deep Belief Networks.;2012;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417955;We present a system for the high-level analysis of beat-synchronous drum patterns to be used as part of a comprehensive rhythmic understanding system. We use a multi-layer neural network, which is greedily pre-trained layer-by-layer using restriced Boltzmann machines (RBMs), in order to model the contextual time-sequence information of a drum pattern. For the input layer of the network, we use a conditional RBM, which has been shown to be an effective generative model of multi-dimensional sequences. Subsequent layers of the neural network can be pre-trained as conditional or standard RBMs in order to learn higher-level rhythmic features. We show that this model can be fine-tuned in a discriminative manner to make accurate predictions about beat-measure alignment. The model generalizes well to multiple rhythmic styles due to the distributed state-space of the multi-layer neural network. In addition, the outputs of the discriminative network can serve as posterior probabilities over beat-alignment labels. These posterior probabilities can be used for Viterbi decoding in a hidden Markov model in order to maintain temporal continuity of the predicted information.;"Eric Battenberg, University of California, Berkeley, USA, education;David Wessel, University of California, Berkeley, USA, education";University of California Berkeley, University of California Berkeley;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;56.558636;-27.255444

While previous work has treated a playlist collection as an undifferentiated whole, we propose to build playlist models which are tuned to speciﬁc categories or dialects of playlists. Toward this end, we develop a general class of ﬂexible and scalable playlist models based upon hypergraph random walks. To evaluate the proposed models, we present a large corpus of categorically annotated, user-generated playlists.

At the song level our approach leverages the multivariate autoregressive mixture (ARM) model, a generative time-series model for audio, which assumes each feature vector in an audio fragment is a linear function of previous feature vectors. To tackle tagmodel estimation, we propose an efﬁcient hierarchical EM algorithm for ARMs (HEM-ARM), which summarizes the acoustic information common to the ARMs modeling the individual songs associated with a tag. We compare the ARM model with the recently proposed dynamic texture mixture (DTM) model. We hence investigate the relative merits of different modeling choices for music time-series: i) the ﬂexibility of selecting higher memory order in ARM, ii) the capability of DTM to learn speciﬁc frequency basis for each particular tag and iii) the effect of the hidden layer of the DT versus the time efﬁciency of learning and inference with fully observable AR components. Finally, we experiment with a support vector machine (SVM) approach that classiﬁes songs based on a kernel calculated on the frequency responses of the corresponding song ARMs. We show that the proposed approach outperforms SVMs trained on a different kernel function, based on a competing generative model.;"Emanuele Coviello, University of California, San Diego, USA, education;Yonatan Vaizman, University of California, San Diego, USA, education;Antoni B.

More specifically we evaluate a framework that recently has been successfully used to recognize objects in images. We first extract local patches from the time-frequency transformed audio signal, which are then pre-processed and used for unsupervised learning of an overcomplete dictionary of local features. For learning we either use a bootstrapped k-means clustering approach or select features randomly. We further extract feature responses in a convolutional manner and train a linear SVM for classification. We extensively evaluate the approach on the GTZAN dataset, emphasizing the influence of important design choices such as dimensionality reduction, pooling and patch dimension on the classification accuracy. We show that convolutional extraction of local feature responses is crucial to reach high performance. Furthermore we find that using this approach, simple and fast learning techniques such as k-means or randomly selected features are competitive with previously published results which also learn features from audio signals.;"Jan W¨ulﬁng, University of Freiburg, DEU, education;Martin Riedmiller, University of Freiburg, DEU, education";University of Freiburg, University of Freiburg;education, education;DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;1.9213109;26.89875

With the maturity of system-centered evaluation in MIR, time is ripe for MIR evaluation to involve users. In this study, we compare user-centered measures to a system effectiveness measure on the task of retrieving similar songs. To collect user-centered measures, we conducted a user experiment with 50 participants using a set of music retrieval systems that have been evaluated by a system-centered approach in the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX). The results reveal weak correlation between user-centered measures and system effectiveness. It is also found that user-centered measures can disclose difference between systems when there was no difference on system-effectiveness.;"Xiao Hu, The University of Hong Kong, HKG, education;Noriko Kando, National Institute of Informatics, JPN, facility";University of Hong Kong, National Institute of Informatics;education, facility;CHN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developed economies;-15.9324465;14.310034

However, how people judge music mood has not been well studied in the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) domain. In particular, people's cultural background is often assumed to be an important factor in music mood perception, but this assumption has not been verified by empirical studies. This paper reports on a study comparing mood judgments on a set of 30 songs by American and Chinese people. Results show that mood judgments do indeed differ between American and Chinese respondents. Furthermore, respondents’ mood judgments tended to agree more with other respondents from the same culture than those from the other group. Both the song characteristics (e.g., genre, lyrical or instrumental) and the non-cultural background of the respondents (e.g., age, gender, familiarity with the songs) were analyzed to further examine the difference in mood judgments. Findings of this study help further our understanding on how cultural background affects mood perception.

To date, however, most techniques produce a representation where pitch estimates are not associated with any particular instrument or voice. Therefore, the actual tracks for each instrument are not readily accessible. Access to individual tracks is needed for more complete music transcription and additionally will provide a window to the analysis of higher constructs such as counterpoint and instrument theme imitation during a composition. In this paper, we present a method for tracking the pitches (F0s) of individual instruments in polyphonic music. The system uses a pre-learned dictionary of spectral basis vectors for each note for a variety of musical instruments. The method then formulates the tracking of pitches of individual voices in a probabilistic manner by attempting to explain the input spectrum as the most likely combination of musical instruments and notes drawn from the dictionary. The method has been evaluated on a subset of the MIREX multiple-F0 estimation test dataset, showing promising results.;"Mert Bay, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA, education;Andreas F.

"Ciril Bohak;Matija Marolt";Finding Repeating Stanzas in Folk Songs.;2012;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417597;Folk songs are typically composed of repeating parts stanzas. To ﬁnd such parts in audio recordings of folk songs, segmentation methods can be used that split a recording into separate parts according to different criteria. Most audio segmentation methods were developed for popular and classical music, however these do not perform well on folk music recordings. This is mainly because folk song recordings contain a number of speciﬁc issues that are not considered by these methods, such as inaccurate singing of performers, variable tempo throughout the song and the presence of noise. In recent years several methods for segmentation of folk songs were developed. In this paper we present a novel method for segmentation of folk songs into repeating stanzas that does not rely on additional information about an individual stanza. The method consists of several steps. In the ﬁrst step breathing (vocal) pauses are detected, which represent the candidate beginnings of individual stanzas. Next, a similarity measure is calculated between the ﬁrst and all other candidate stanzas, which takes into account pitch changes between stanzas and tempo variations. To evaluate which candidate beginnings represent the actual boundaries between stanzas, a scoring function is deﬁned based on the calculated similarities between stanzas. A peak picking method is used in combination with global thresholding for the ﬁnal selection of stanza boundaries. The presented method was tested and evaluated on a collection of Slovenian folk songs from EthnoMuse archive.;"Ciril Bohak, University of Ljubljana, SVN, education;Matija Marolt, University of Ljubljana, SVN, education";University of Ljubljana, University of Ljubljana;education, education;SVN, SVN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-9.129546;24.955853

Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) has been recently employed to this problem producing very successful results. The method decomposes the signal into a low-rank component corresponding to the accompaniment with its repetitive structure, and a sparse component corresponding to the voice with its quasi-harmonic structure. In this paper we first introduce a non-negative variant of RPCA, termed as robust low-rank non-negative matrix factorization (RNMF). This new framework better suits audio applications. We then propose two efficient feed-forward architectures that approximate the RPCA and RNMF with low latency and a fraction of the complexity of the original optimization method. These approximants allow incorporating elements of unsupervised, semiand fully-supervised learning into the RPCA and RNMF frameworks. Our basic implementation shows several orders of magnitude speedup compared to the exact solvers with no performance degradation, and allows online and faster-than-real-time processing.

The MIREX audio key finding contest has been held twice using classical compositions for which the key is designated in the title. The problem with this accepted practice is that the title key may not be the perceived key in the audio excerpt. To reduce manual annotation, which is costly, we use a confusion index generated by existing audio key finding algorithms to determine if an audio excerpt requires manual annotation. We collected 3224 excerpts and identified 727 excerpts requiring manual annotation. We evaluate the algorithms’ performance on these challenging cases using the title keys, and the re-labeled keys. The musicians who aurally identify the key also provide comments on the reasons for their choice. The relabeling process reveals the mismatch between title and perceived keys to be caused by tuning practices (in 471 of the 727 excerpts, 64.79%), and other factors (188 excerpts, 25.86%) including key modulation and intonation choices. The remaining 68 challenging cases provide useful information for algorithm design.;"Ching-Hua Chuan, University of North Florida, USA, education;Elaine Chew, Queen Mary, University of London, GBR, education";University of North Florida, Queen Mary University of London;education, education;USA, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;13.913662;9.12235

Proposals for achieving the necessary interoperability have ranged from shared software libraries and interfaces, through common frameworks and portals, to standardised ﬁle formats and metadata. Each proposal shares the desire to reuse and combine repurposable components into assemblies (or “workﬂows”) that can be used in novel and possibly more ambitious ways. Reuse and remixing also have great implications for the process of MIR research. The encapsulation of any algorithm and its operation – including inputs, parameters, and outputs – is fundamental to the repeatability and reproducibility of any experiment. This is desirable both for the open and reliable evaluation of algorithms (e.g. in MIREX) and for the advancement of MIR by building more effectively upon prior research. At present there is no clear best practice widely adopted throughout the community. Should this be considered a failure? Are there limits to interoperability unique to MIR, and how might they be overcome?

In order to test the proposed method, an analysis of characteristic melodic patterns in the context of the flamenco fandango style was performed. To this end, a number of such patterns were defined in symbolic format by flamenco experts and were later detected in music corpora, which were composed of un-segmented audio recordings taken from two fandango styles, namely Valverde fandangos and Huelva capital fandangos.

Automatic music transcription involves several subproblems that are interdependent of each other: multiple fundamental frequency estimation, onset detection, and rhythm/tempo recognition. In general, simultaneous estimation is preferable when several estimation problems have chicken-and-egg relationships. This paper proposes modeling the generative process of an entire music spectrogram by combining the sub-process by which a musically natural tempo curve is generated, the sub-process by which a set of note onset positions is generated based on a 2-dimensional tree structure representation of music, and the sub-process by which a music spectrogram is generated according to the tempo curve and the note onset positions. Most conventional approaches to music transcription perform note extraction prior to structure analysis, but accurate note extraction has been a difficult task. By contrast, thanks to the combined generative model, the present method performs note extraction and structure estimation simultaneously and thus the optimal solution is obtained within a unified framework.

Subsequently, for each beat-synchronised chromagram we compute a list of chord candidates matching that chromagram, together with the confidence in each candidate. When one particular chord candidate matches the chromagram significantly better than all others, this chord is selected to represent the segment.

This article introduces SymbTr, a Turkish Makam Music Symbolic Representation Database, aimed at filling this void. SymbTr consists of musical information in text, PDF, and MIDI formats. Raw data, drawn from reliable sources, and consisting of 1,700 musical pieces in Turkish art and folk music was processed featuring distinct examples in 155 diverse makams, 100 usuls and 48 forms. Special care was devoted to selection of works that scatter across a broad historical time span and were among those still performed today. Total number of musical notes in these pieces was 630,000, corresponding to a nominal playback time of 72 hours. Synthesized sounds particular to Turkish makam music were used in MIDI playback, and transcription/playback errors were corrected by input from experts. Symbolic representation data, open to the public, is output from a computer program developed exclusively for Turkish makam music. SymbTr was designed as a wholesome representation of aforementioned distinct auditory and visual features that distinguish Turkish makam music from other music genres. This article explains the database format in detail, and also provides, through examples, statistical information on pitch/interval allocation and distribution.;M.

Yi-Hsuan Yang;Low-Rank Representation of Both Singing Voice and Music Accompaniment Via Learned Dictionaries.;2013;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1418089;Recent research work has shown that the magnitude spectrogram of a song can be considered as a superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component, which appear to correspond to the instrumental part and the vocal part of the song, respectively. Based on this observation, one can separate singing voice from the background music. However, the quality of such separation might be limited, because the vocal part of a song can sometimes be low-rank as well. Therefore, we propose to learn the subspace structures of vocal and instrumental sounds from a collection of clean signals first, and then compute the low-rank representations of both the vocal and instrumental parts of a song based on the learned subspaces. Specifically, we use online dictionary learning to learn the subspaces, and propose a new algorithm called multiple low-rank representation (MLRR) to decompose a magnitude spectrogram into two low-rank matrices. Our approach is flexible in that the subspaces of singing voice and music accompaniment are both learned from data. Evaluation on the MIR-1K dataset shows that the approach improves the source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) and the source-to-interference ratio (SIR), but not the source-to-artifact ratio (SAR).;Yi-Hsuan Yang, Research Center for IT Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taiwan, facility;Academia Sinica;facility;TWN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies;36.868263;-7.9448566

In this paper, we argue that the phase information, which is usually overlooked in the literature, is also informative in modeling the voice timbre of a singer, given the necessary processing techniques. Specifically, instead of directly using the raw phase spectrum as features, we show that significantly better performance can be obtained by learning sparse features from the negative derivative of phase with respect to frequency (i.e., group delay function) using unsupervised feature learning algorithms. Moreover, better performance is achieved by using singing voice separation as a pre-processing step, and then learning features from both the magnitude spectrum and the group delay function.

In this work, we adopt recent machine learning methods to map such song representations to binary codes. A linear scan over the codes quickly ﬁnds a small set of likely neighbors for a query to be reﬁned with the original expensive similarity measure. Although search costs grow linearly with the collection size, we show that for commercial-scale databases and two state-of-the-art similarity measures, this outperforms ﬁve previous attempts at approximate nearest neighbor search.

This task is challenging, because musical pieces often contain parts that may or may not be repeated by the performer, possibly leading to structural differences between performances (or between performance and score). The most common alignment method, dynamic time warping (DTW), cannot handle structural differences adequately, and existing approaches to deal with structural differences explicitly rely on the annotation of “break points” in one of the sequences. We propose a simple extension of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to deal effectively with structural differences, without relying on annotations. We evaluate several audio features for alignment, and show how an optimal value can be found for the cost-parameter of the alignment algorithm. A single cost value is demonstrated to be valid across different types of music. We demonstrate that our approach yields roughly equal alignment accuracies compared to DTW in the absence of structural differences, and superior accuracies when structural differences occur.;"Maarten Grachten, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI), Vienna, Austria, facility;Martin Gasser, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI), Vienna, Austria, facility;Andreas Arzt, Johannes Kepler Universität, Linz, Austria, education;Gerhard Widmer, Johannes Kepler Universität, Linz, Austria, education";Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Johannes Kepler University;facility, facility, facility, education;AUT, AUT, AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-14.602395;-32.10663

When converting the audio recording into a suitable self-similarity matrix (SSM), repetitions typically lead to path structures, whereas homogeneous regions yield block structures. In previous research, handling both structural elements at the same time has turned out to be a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce a novel procedure for converting path structures into block structures by applying an eigenvalue decomposition of the SSM in combination with suitable clustering techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our conversion approach by showing that algorithms previously designed for homogeneity-based structure analysis can now be applied for repetition-based structure analysis.

Lute tablature is a practical notation that reveals only very limited information about polyphonic structure. This has complicated research into the large surviving corpus of lute music, notated exclusively in tablature. A solution may be found in automatic transcription, of which voice separation is a necessary step. During the last decade, several methods for separating voices in symbolic polyphonic music formats have been developed. However, all but two of these methods adopt a rule-based approach; moreover, none of them is designed for tablature. Our method differs on both these points. First, rather than using fixed rules, we use a model that learns from data: a neural network that predicts voice assignments for notes. Second, our method is specifically designed for tablature—tablature information is included in the features used as input for the models—but it can also be applied to other music corpora. We have experimented on a dataset containing tablature pieces of different polyphonic textures, and compare the results against those obtained from a baseline hidden Markov model (HMM) model. Additionally, we have performed a preliminary comparison of the neural network model with several existing methods for voice separation on a small dataset.

In previous work, we have investigated using magnitude spectra as the network observations, ﬁnding reasonable improvements over standard acoustic representations. However, in necessarily supervised problems such as music emotion recognition, there is no guarantee that the starting points for optimization are anywhere near optimal, as emotion is unlikely to be the most dominant aspect of the data. In this new work, we develop input representations using harmonic/percussive source separation designed to inform rhythm and melodic contour. These representations are beat synchronous, providing an event-driven representation, and potentially the ability to learn emotion informative representations from pre-training alone.

Although the former approach was dominant in the past, feature learning has started to receive more attention from the MIR community in recent years. Recent results in feature learning indicate that simple algorithms such as K-means can be very effective, sometimes surpassing more complicated approaches based on restricted Boltzmann machines, autoencoders or sparse coding. Furthermore, there has been increased interest in multiscale representations of music audio recently. Such representations are more versatile because music audio exhibits structure on multiple timescales, which are relevant for different MIR tasks to varying degrees. We develop and compare three approaches to multiscale audio feature learning using the spherical K-means algorithm. We evaluate them in an automatic tagging task and a similarity metric learning task on the Magnatagatune dataset.;"Sander Dieleman, Ghent University, BEL, education;Benjamin Schrauwen, Ghent University, BEL, education";Ghent University, Ghent University;education, education;BEL, BEL;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;2.580644;20.285486
Dekai Wu;Simultaneous Unsupervised Learning of Flamenco Metrical Structure, Hypermetrical Structure, and Multipart Structural Relations.;2013;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1414772;We show how a new unsupervised approach to learning musical relationships can exploit Bayesian MAP induction of stochastic transduction grammars to overcome the challenges of learning complex relationships between multiple rhythmic parts that previously lay outside the scope of general computational approaches to music structure learning. A good illustrative genre is flamenco, which employs not only regular but also irregular hypermetrical structures that rapidly switch between 3/4 and 6/8 mediocompas blocks. Moreover, typical flamenco idioms employ heavy syncopation and sudden, misleading off-beat accents and patterns, while often elliding the downbeat accents that humans as well as existing meter-finding algorithms rely on, thus creating a high degree of listener “surprise” that makes not only the structural relations, but even the metrical structure itself, ellusive to learn. Flamenco musicians rely on both complex regular hypermetrical knowledge as well as irregular real-time clues to recognize when to switch meters and patterns. Our new approach envisions this as an integrated problem of learning a bilingual transduction, i.e., a structural relation between two languages—where there are different musical languages of, say, flamenco percussion versus zapateado footwork or palmas hand clapping. We apply minimum description length criteria to induce transduction grammars that simultaneously learn (1) the multiple metrical structures, (2) the hypermetrical structure that stochastically governs meter switching, and (3) the probabilistic transduction relationship between patterns of different rhythmic languages that enables musicians to predict when to switch meters and how to select patterns depending on what fellow musicians are generating.;Dekai Wu, HKUST, Human Language Technology Center, Department of CSE, Hong Kong, education;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;education;HKG;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies;-10.156011;-5.5760202
"Bin Wu;Simon Wun;Chung Lee;Andrew Horner";Spectral Correlates in Emotion Labeling of Sustained Musical Instrument Tones.;2013;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417443;Music is one of the strongest inducers of emotion in humans. Melody, rhythm, and harmony provide the primary triggers, but what about timbre? Do the musical instruments have underlying emotional characters? For example, is the well-known melancholy sound of the English horn due to its timbre or to how composers use it? Though music emotion recognition has received a lot of attention, researchers have only recently begun considering the relationship between emotion and timbre. To this end, we devised a listening test to compare representative tones from eight different wind and string instruments. The goal was to determine if some tones were consistently perceived as being happier or sadder in pairwise comparisons. A total of eight emotions were tested in the study. The results showed strong underlying emotional characters for each instrument. The emotions Happy, Joyful, Heroic, and Comic were strongly correlated with one another. The violin, trumpet, and clarinet best represented these emotions. Sad and Depressed were also strongly correlated. These two emotions were best represented by the horn and flute. Scary was the emotional outlier of the group, while the oboe had the most emotionally neutral timbre. Also, we found that emotional judgment correlates significantly with average spectral centroid for the more distinctive emotions, including Happy, Joyful, Sad, Depressed, and Shy. These results can provide insights in orchestration, and lay the groundwork for future studies on emotion and timbre.;"Bin Wu, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HKG, education;Simon Wun, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HKG, education;Chung Lee, Singapore University of Technology and Design, SGP, education;Andrew Horner, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HKG, education";Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology;education, education, education, education;HKG, HKG, SGP, HKG;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;-32.620255;54.685318
"Vipul Arora;Laxmidhar Behera";Semi-Supervised Polyphonic Source Identification using PLCA Based Graph Clustering.;2013;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1418293;For identifying instruments or singers in the polyphonic audio, supervised probabilistic latent component analysis (PLCA) is a popular tool. But in many cases individual source audio is not available for training. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel scheme using semisupervised PLCA with probabilistic graph clustering, which does not require individual sources for training. The PLCA is based on source-ﬁlter approach which models the spectral envelope as a weighted sum of elementary band-pass ﬁlters. The novel graph based approach, embedded in the PLCA framework, takes into account various perceptual cues for characterizing a source. These cues include temporal cues like the evolution of F0 contours as well as the acoustic cues like mel-frequency cepstral coefﬁcients. The proposed scheme shows better results in identifying vocal sources than a state of the art unsupervised scheme. In addition, the proposed framework can be used to incorporate perceptual cues so as to enhance the performance of supervised schemes too.;"Vipul Arora, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, IND, education;Laxmidhar Behera, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, IND, education";IIT Kanpur,IIT Kanpur;education, education;IND, IND;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;33.400585;-27.398329

Indian classical music is considered to be one of the oldest musical traditions in the world but compared to Western music very little work has been done in the areas of genre recognition, classiﬁcation, automatic tagging, comparative studies etc. In this work, we investigate the structural differences between Indian and Western music forms and compare the two forms of music in terms of harmony, rhythm, microtones, timbre and other spectral features. To capture the temporal and static structure of the spectrogram, we form a set of global and local frame-wise features for 5genres of each music form. We then apply Adaboost classiﬁcation and GMM based Hidden Markov Models for four types of feature sets and observe that Indian Music performs better as compared to Western Music. We have achieved a best accuracy of 98.0% and 77.5% for Indian and Western musical genres respectively. Our comparative analysis indicates that features that work well with one form of music may not necessarily perform well with the other form.

"Pranay Dighe;Harish Karnick;Bhiksha Raj";Swara Histogram Based Structural Analysis And Identification Of Indian Classical Ragas.;2013;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417841;This work is an attempt towards robust automated analysis of Indian classical ragas through machine learning and signal processing tools and techniques. Indian classical music has a definite heirarchical structure where macro level concepts like thaats and raga are defined in terms of micro entities like swaras and shrutis. Swaras or notes in Indian music are defined only in terms of their relation to one another (akin to the movable do-re-mi-fa system), and an inference must be made from patterns of sounds, rather than their absolute frequency structure. We have developed methods to perform scale-independent raga identification using a random forest classifier on swara histograms and achieved state-of-the-art results for the same. The approach is robust as it directly works on partly noisy raga recordings from Youtube videos without knowledge of the scale used, whereas previous work in this direction often use audios generated in a controlled environment with the desired scale. The current work demonstrates the approach for 8 ragas namely Darbari, Khamaj, Malhar, Sohini, Bahar, Basant, Bhairavi and Yaman and we have achieved an average identification accuracy of 94.28% through the framework.;"Pranay Dighe, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India, education;Harish Karnick, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India, education;Bhiksha Raj, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh PA, USA, education";IIT Kanpur,IIT Kanpur, Carnegie Mellon University;education, education, education;IND, IND, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developed economies;31.56308;24.050125

A concert in carnatic music is replete with applauses. These applauses may be inter-item or intra-item applauses. A property of an item in carnatic music, is that within every item, a small portion of the audio corresponds to the rendering of a composition which is rendered by the entire ensemble of lead performer and accompanying instruments. A concert is divided into segments using applauses and the location of the ensemble in every item is ﬁrst obtained using Cent Filterbank Cepstral Coefﬁcients (CFCC) combined with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Since constituent parts of an item are rendered in a single raga, raga information is used to merge adjacent segments belonging to the same item. Inter-item applauses are used to locate the end of an item in a concert. The results are evaluated for ﬁfty live recordings with 990 applauses in total. The classiﬁcation accuracy for inter and intra item applauses is 93%. Given a song list and the audio, the song list is mapped to the segmented audio of items, which are then stored in the database.;"Padi Sarala, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, IND, education;Hema A.Murthy, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, IND, education";IIT Madras, IIT Madras;education, education;IND, IND;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;1.7885914;13.672848

Melody in Carnatic music is based on the concept of raga. Melodic motifs are signature phrases which give a raga its identity. They are also the fundamental units that enable extempore elaborations of a raga. In this paper, an attempt is made to spot typical melodic motifs of a raga queried in a musical piece using a two pass dynamic programming approach, with pitch as the basic feature. In the first pass, the rough longest common subsequence (RLCS) matching is performed between the saddle points of the pitch contours of the reference motif and the musical piece. These saddle points corresponding to quasi-stationary points of the motifs, are relevant entities of the raga. Multiple sequences are identified in this step, not all of which correspond to the the motif that is queried. To reduce the false alarms, in the second pass a fine search using RLCS is performed between the continuous pitch contours of the reference motif and the subsequences obtained in the first pass. The proposed methodology is validated by testing on Alapanas of 20 different musicians.;"Vignesh Ishwar, IIT Madras, IND, education;Shrey Dutta, IIT Madras, IND, education;Ashwin Bellur, IIT Madras, IND, education;Hema A Murthy, IIT Madras, IND, education";IIT Madras, IIT Madras, IIT Madras, IIT Madras;education, education, education, education;IND, IND, IND, IND;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;30.779036;21.617018

We propose a hierarchical approach for classiﬁcation of these forms as different combinations of rhythm, percussion and repetitive syllabic structures. The proposed 3-level hierarchy is based on various signal processing measures and classiﬁers. Features derived from short term energy contours, along with formant information are used to obtain discriminative features. The statistics of the features are used to design simple classiﬁers at each level of the hierarchy. The method is validated on a subset of IIT-M Carnatic concert music database, comprising of more than 20 hours of music. Using 10 s audio clips, we get an average f-ratio performance of 0.62 for the classiﬁcation of the following six typesof Carnatic art music: /AlApana/, /viruttam/, /thillAna/, /krithi/, /thani-Avarthanam/ and /thAnam/.;"Ranjani.

"Nanzhu Jiang;Meinard Müller";Automated Methods for Analyzing Music Recordings in Sonata Form.;2013;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1418283;The sonata form has been one of the most important large-scale musical structures used since the early Classical period. Typically, the ﬁrst movements of symphonies and sonatas follow the sonata form, which (in its most basic form) starts with an exposition and a repetition thereof, continues with a development, and closes with a recapitulation. The recapitulation can be regarded as an altered repeat of the exposition, where certain substructures (ﬁrst and second subject groups) appear in musically modiﬁed forms. In this paper, we introduce automated methods for analyzing music recordings in sonata form, where we proceed in two steps. In the ﬁrst step, we derive the coarse structure by exploiting that the recapitulation is a kind of repetition of the exposition. This requires audio structure analysis tools that are invariant under local modulations. In the second step, we identify ﬁner substructures by capturing relative modulations between the subject groups in exposition and recapitulation. We evaluate and discuss our results by means of the Beethoven piano sonatas. In particular, we introduce a novel visualization that not only indicates the beneﬁts and limitations of our methods, but also yields some interesting musical insights into the data.;"Nanzhu Jiang, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, facility;Meinard Müller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, facility";International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen;facility, facility;DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;17.29301;-19.037266

However, when applied to real-world scenarios, even established techniques, which are often developed and tested under lab conditions, reach their limits. In this paper, we illustrate some of these challenges by presenting a study on automated audio segmentation in the context of the interdisciplinary project “Freischütz Digital”. One basic task arising in this project is to automatically segment different recordings of the opera “Der Freischütz” according to a reference segmentation specified by a domain expert (musicologist). As it turns out, the task is more complex as one may think at first glance due to significant acoustic and structural variations across the various recordings. As our main contribution, we reveal and discuss these variations by systematically adapting segmentation procedures based on synchronization and matching techniques.;"Thomas Pr¨atzlich, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, facility;Meinard M¨uller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, facility";International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen;facility, facility;DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;10.281152;14.618942

These assumptions relate to the novelty, homogeneity, repetition and/or regularity of the content. Each of these assumptions provide a different perspective on the music piece. These assumptions are however often considered separately in the methods. In this paper we propose a method for estimating the music structure segmentation based on the fusion of the novelty and repetition assumptions. This combination of different perspectives on the music pieces allows to generate more coherent acoustic segments and strongly improves the final music structure segmentation’s performance.;"Florian Kaiser, STMS IRCAM-CNRS-UPMC, FRA, facility;Geoffroy Peeters, STMS IRCAM-CNRS-UPMC, FRA, facility";IRCAM,IRCAM;facility, facility;FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;5.6663766;10.197787

The former system works by looking for peaks in novelty curves derived from self-similarity matrices. The latter relies on the detection of key changes and on the differences in prior probability of chord transitions according to their position in a structural segment. Both approaches are integrated into a probabilistic system that jointly estimates keys, chords and structural boundaries. The novelty curves are herein used as observations. In addition, chroma profiles are used as features for the harmony analysis. These observations are then subjected to a constrained transition model that is musically motivated. An information theoretic justification of this model is also given. Finally, an evaluation of the resulting system is performed.

We use the Shoutcast API to collect historical data about the artists that are played on a large set of Internet radio stations. This data is used to populate an artist-station index that is similar to the term-document matrix of a traditional text-based information retrieval system. When a user wants to ﬁnd stations for a given seed artist, we check the index to determine a set of stations that are either currently playing or have recently played that artist. These stations are grouped into three clusters and one representative station is selected from each cluster. This promotes diversity among the stations that are returned to the user. In addition, we provide additional information such as relevant tags (e.g., genres, emotions) and similar artists to give the user more contextual information about the recommended stations. Finally, we describe a web-based user interface that provides an interactive experience that is more like a personalized Internet radio player (e.g., Pandora) and less like a search engine for Internet radio stations (e.g., Shoutcast).

It weights the differences of the magnitude spectrogram used for the calculation of the spectral flux onset detection function on the basis of the local group delay information. With this weighting technique applied, the onset detection function is able to reliably distinguish between genuine onsets and spectral energy peaks originating from vibrato or tremolo present in the signal and lowers the number of false positive detections considerably. Especially in cases of music with numerous vibratos and tremolos (e.g. opera singing or string performances) the number of false positive detections can be reduced by up to 50% without missing any additional events. Performance is evaluated and compared to current state-of-the-art algorithms using three different datasets comprising mixed audio material (25,927 onsets), violin recordings (7,677 onsets) and solo voice recordings of operas (1,448 onsets).;"Sebastian Böck, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria, education;Gerhard Widmer, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria, education";Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University;education, education;AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;46.57972;4.799228

Problems detected include edit errors, clipping, noise infiltration, poor use of dynamics, poor track balancing, and many others. The error detection algorithms are highly configurable, in order to meet the varying aesthetics of different musical genres (e.g. Baroque vs. noise music). Effective general-purpose default settings were developed based on experiments with a variety of student pieces, and these settings were then validated using a reserved set of student pieces. jProductionCritic is also designed to serve as an extensible framework to which new detection modules can be easily plugged in. It is hoped that this will help to galvanize MIR research relating to audio production, an area that is currently underrepresented in the MIR literature, and that this work will also help to address the current general lack of educational production software.;Cory McKay, Marianopolis College, CAN, education, CIRMMT, CAN, facility;Marianopolis College;education;CAN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;23.847822;22.637041

The framework facilitates the creation of web applications in which polyphonic transcription and guitar tablature arrangement algorithms can be embedded. Such a web application is implemented, and consists of an existing polyphonic transcription algorithm and a new guitar tablature arrangement algorithm. The result is a unified system that is capable of transcribing guitar tablature from a digital audio recording and displaying the resulting tablature in the web browser. Additionally, two ground-truth datasets for polyphonic transcription and guitar tablature arrangement are compiled from manual transcriptions gathered from the tablature website ultimate-guitar.com.

It is important to extract the bounding boxes of measures within a music score to facilitate some methods of multimodal navigation of music catalogues. We present an image processing algorithm that extracts the position of barlines on an input music score in order to deduce the number and position of measures on the page. An open-source implementation of this algorithm is made publicly available. In addition, we have created a ground-truth dataset of 100 images of music scores with manually annotated measures. We conducted several experiments using different combinations of values for two critical parameters to evaluate our measure recognition algorithm. Our algorithm obtained an f-score of 91 percent with the optimal set of parameters. Although our implementation obtained results similar to previous approaches, the scope and size of the evaluation dataset is significantly larger.;"Gabriel Vigliensoni, McGill University, CAN, education;Gregory Burlet, McGill University, CAN, education;Ichiro Fujinaga, McGill University, CAN, education";McGill University, McGill University, McGill University;education, education, education;CAN, CAN, CAN;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-6.052125;-58.45644
"Sai Sumanth Miryala;Kalika Bali;Ranjita Bhagwan;Monojit Choudhury";Automatically Identifying Vocal Expressions for Music Transcription.;2013;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416624;Music transcription has many uses ranging from music information retrieval to better education tools. An important component of automated transcription is the identiﬁcation and labeling of different kinds of vocal expressions such as vibrato, glides, and riffs. In Indian Classical Music such expressions are particularly important since a raga is often established and identiﬁed by the correct use of these expressions. It is not only important to classify what the expression is, but also when it starts and ends in a vocal rendition. Some examples of such expressions that are key to Indian music are Meend (vocal glides) and Andolan (very slow vibrato). In this paper, we present an algorithm for the automatic transcription and expression identiﬁcation of vocal renditions with speciﬁc application to North Indian Classical Music. Using expert human annotation as the ground truth, we evaluate this algorithm and compare it with two machinelearning approaches. Our results show that we correctly identify the expressions and transcribe vocal music with 85% accuracy. As a part of this effort, we have created a corpus of 35 voice recordings, of which 12 recordings are annotated by experts.

One of the reasons for its popularity has been the willingness of Bollywood composers to adopt and be inﬂuenced by various musical forms including Western pop, jazz, rock, and classical music. However, till date, we are unaware of any systematic quantitative analysis of how this genre has changed and evolved over the years since its inception in the early 20th century. In this paper, we study the evolution of Bollywood music with respect to the use of melodic scales. We analyse songs composed over seven decades using a database of top-lists, which reveals many interesting patterns. We also analyze the scale usage patterns in the music of some of the most popular composers, which clearly brings out certain idiosyncrasies and preferences of each of them.;"Monojit Choudhury, Microsoft Research Lab India, IND, facility;Ranjita Bhagwan, Microsoft Research Lab India, IND, facility;Kalika Bali, Microsoft Research Lab India, IND, facility";Microsoft Research India, Microsoft Research India, Microsoft Research India;company, company, company;IND, IND, IND;FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;-17.865818;-14.646598

A key element of musical composition is the arrangement of chord sequences because good chord arrangements have the potential to enrich the listening experience and create a pleasant feeling of surprise by borrowing elements from different musical styles in unexpected ways. While chord sequences have conventionally been modeled by using N-grams, generative grammars, or music theoretic rules, our system decomposes a matrix consisting of chord transition probabilities by using nonnegative matrix factorization. This enables us to not only generate chord sequences from scratch but also transfer characteristic transition patterns from one chord sequence to another. ChordSequenceFactory can assist users to edit chord sequences by modifying factorized chord transition probabilities and then automatically re-arranging them. By leveraging knowledge from chord sequences of over 2000 songs, our system can help users generate a wide range of musically interesting and entertaining chord arrangements.;"Satoru Fukayama, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility;Kazuyoshi Yoshii, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;facility, facility, facility;JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;24.698523;-50.55514

Given a user-specified input song, the system first identifies the phrase-level structure and then estimates the “mashability” between each phrase section of the input and songs in the user’s music collection. Mashability is calculated based on the harmonic similarity between beat synchronous chromagrams over a user-definable range of allowable key shifts and tempi. Once a match in the collection for a given section of the input song has been found, a pitch-shifting and time-stretching algorithm is used to harmonically and temporally align the sections, after which the loudness of the transformed section is modified to ensure a balanced mix. AutoMashUpper has a user interface to allow visualisation and manipulation of mashups. When creating a mashup, users can specify a list of songs to choose from, modify the mashability parameters and change the granularity of the phrase segmentation. Once created, users can also switch, add, or remove sections from the mashup to suit their taste. In this way, AutoMashUpper can assist users to actively create new music content by enabling and encouraging them to explore the mashup space.;"Matthew E. P.

In a traditional supervised machine learning setting, a system can only use labeled data from a single dataset to solve a given task. The labels associated with the dataset deﬁne the nature of the task to solve. A key advantage of transfer learning is in leveraging knowledge from related tasks to improve performance on a given target task. One way to transfer knowledge is to learn a shared latent representation across related tasks. This method has shown to be beneﬁcial in many domains of machine learning, but has yet to be explored in MIR. Many MIR datasets for audio classiﬁcation present a semantic overlap in their labels. Furthermore, these datasets often contain relatively few songs. Thus, there is a strong case for exploring methods to share knowledge between these datasets towards a more general and robust understanding of high level musical concepts such as genre and similarity. Our results show that shared representations can improve classiﬁcation accuracy. We also show how transfer learning can improve performance for music similarity.;"Philippe Hamel, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility;Matthew E.

Although non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has recently become very popular for music source separation, it deals only with the amplitude or power of the spectrogram of a given mixture signal and completely discards the phase. The component spectrograms are typically estimated using a Wiener filter that reuses the phase of the mixture spectrogram, but such rough phase reconstruction makes it hard to recover high-quality source signals because the estimated spectrograms are inconsistent, i.e., they do not correspond to any real time-domain signals. To avoid the frequency-domain phase reconstruction, we use positive semidefinite tensor factorization (PSDTF) for directly estimating source signals from the mixture signal in the time domain. Since PSDTF is a natural extension of NMF, an efficient multiplicative update algorithm for PSDTF can be derived. Experimental results show that PSDTF outperforms conventional NMF variants in terms of source separation quality.;"Kazuyoshi Yoshii, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility;Ryota Tomioka, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education;Daichi Mochihashi, The Institute of Statistical Mathematics (ISM), JPN, education;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, The Institute of Statistical Mathematics, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;facility, education, education, facility;JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;45.262024;-18.957523

Manually creating medley is time consuming because it is not easy to ﬁnd out proper clips to put in succession and seamlessly connect them. In this work, we propose a framework for creating personalized music medleys from users’ music collection. Unlike existing similar works in which only low-level features are used to select candidate clips and locate possible transition points among clips, we take song structures and song phrasing into account during medley creation. Inspired by the musical dice game, we treat the medley generation process as an audio version of musical dice game. That is, once the analysis on the songs of user collection has been done, the system is able to generate various medleys with different probabilities. This flexibility brings us the ability to create medleys according to the user-specified conditions, such as the medley structure or some must-use clips. The preliminary subjective evaluations showed that the proposed system is effective in selecting connectable clips that preserved chord progression structure.

Here, we improve upon previous work in large-scale cover song identification by using data-driven projections at different time-scales to capture local features and embed summary vectors into a semantically organized space. We achieve this by projecting 2D-Fourier Magnitude Coefficients (2D-FMCs) of beat-chroma patches into a sparse, high dimensional representation which, due to the shift invariance properties of the Fourier Transform, is similar in principle to convolutional sparse coding. After aggregating these local beat-chroma projections, we apply supervised dimensionality reduction to recover an embedding where distance is useful for cover song retrieval. Evaluating on the Million Song Dataset, we find our method outperforms the current state of the art overall, but significantly so for top-k metrics, which indicate improved usability.;"Eric J.

"Mark Brozier Cartwright;Bryan Pardo";Social-EQ: Crowdsourcing an Equalization Descriptor Map.;2013;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415792;We seek to simplify audio production interfaces (such as those for equalization) by letting users communicate their audio production objectives with descriptive language (e.g. “Make the violin sound ‘warmer.’”). To achieve this goal, a system must be able to tell whether the stated goal is appropriate for the selected tool (e.g. making the violin “warmer” with a panning tool does not make sense). If the goal is appropriate for the tool, it must know what actions need to be taken. Further, the tool should not impose a vocabulary on users, but rather understand the vocabulary users prefer. In this work, we describe SocialEQ, a webbased project for learning a vocabulary of actionable audio equalization descriptors. Since deployment, SocialEQ has learned 324 distinct words in 731 learning sessions. Data on these terms is made available for download.

Many music/voice separation techniques tend to focus on modeling one source; the residual is then used to explain the other source. In such cases, separation performance is often unsatisfactory for the source that has not been explicitly modeled. In this work, we propose to combine a method that explicitly models singing voice with a method that explicitly models background music, to address separation performance from the point of view of both sources. One method learns a singer-independent model of voice from singing examples using a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) based technique, while the other method derives a model of music by identifying and extracting repeating patterns using a similarity matrix and a median filter. Since the model of voice is singer-independent and the model of music does not require training data, the proposed method does not require training data from a user, once deployed. Evaluation on a data set of 1,000 song clips showed that combining modeling of both sources can improve separation performance, when compared with modeling only one of the sources, and also compared with two other state-of-the-art methods.";"Zafar Raﬁi, Northwestern University, USA, education;Franc¸ois G.

Some research revealed that among the features employed in music emotion recognition, lyric has the best performance on valence, MIDI takes the second place, and audio is the worst. However, lyric cannot be found in some music types, such as instrumental music. In this case, MIDI features can be considered as a choice for music emotion recognition on valence dimension. In this presented work, we systematically explored the effect and value of using MIDI features for music emotion recognition. Emotion recognition was treated as a regression problem in this paper. We also discussed the emotion regression performance of three aspects of music in terms of edited MIDI: chorus, melody, and accompaniment. We found that the MIDI features performed better than audio features on valence. And under the realistic conditions, converted MIDI performed better than edited MIDI on valence. We found that melody was more important to valence regression than accompaniment, which was in contrary to arousal. We also found that the chorus part of an edited MIDI might contain as sufficient information as the entire edited MIDI for valence regression.;"Yi Lin, Institute of Computer Science & Technology, Peking University, CHN, education;Xiaoou Chen, Institute of Computer Science & Technology, Peking University, CHN, education;Deshun Yang, Institute of Computer Science & Technology, Peking University, CHN, education";Peking University,Peking University,Peking University;education, education, education;CHN, CHN, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;-29.539225;59.15528

"Matthias Mauch;Sebastian Ewert";The Audio Degradation Toolbox and Its Application to Robustness Evaluation.;2013;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415862;We introduce the Audio Degradation Toolbox (ADT) for the controlled degradation of audio signals, and propose its usage as a means of evaluating and comparing the robustness of audio processing algorithms. Music recordings encountered in practical applications are subject to varied, sometimes unpredictable degradation. For example, audio is degraded by low-quality microphones, noisy recording environments, MP3 compression, dynamic compression in broadcasting or vinyl decay. In spite of this, no standard software for the degradation of audio exists, and music processing methods are usually evaluated against clean data. The ADT fills this gap by providing Matlab scripts that emulate a wide range of degradation types. We describe 14 degradation units, and how they can be chained to create more complex, ‘real-world’ degradations. The ADT also provides functionality to adjust existing ground-truth, correcting for temporal distortions introduced by degradation. Using four different music informatics tasks, we show that performance strongly depends on the combination of method and degradation applied. We demonstrate that specific degradations can reduce or even reverse the performance difference between two competing methods.

The study focuses on the relevance of gestural (e.g. visual, breath) cues in achieving note onset synchrony in a violin and cello duo, in which musicians must fulﬁll a mutual conducting role. The musicians performed two pieces – one with long notes separated by long pauses, another with long notes but no pauses – under direct, partial (silhouettes), and no line of sight. Analysis of the musicians’ note synchrony shows that visual contact signiﬁcantly impacts synchronization in the ﬁrst piece, but not signiﬁcantly in the second piece, leading to the hypothesis that opportunities to shape notes may provide further cues for synchronization. The results also show that breath cues are important, and that the relative positions of these cues impact note asynchrony at the ends of pauses; thus, the advance timing information provided by breath cues could form a basis for generating virtual cues in distributed performance, where network latency delays sonic and visual cues. This study demonstrates the need to account for structure (e.g. pauses, long notes) and prosodic gestures in ensemble synchronisation.";"Bogdan Vera, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Elaine Chew, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Patrick G.

Despite their successes, these methods only guarantee that the decomposition converges to a local minimum in the cost function. In order to ﬁnd better local minima, we propose to extend an existing PLCA-based transcription method with the deterministic annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm. The PLCA update rules are modiﬁed by introducing a “temperature” parameter. At higher temperatures, general areas of the search space containing good solutions are found. As the temperature is gradually decreased, distinctions in the data are sharpened, resulting in a more ﬁne-grained optimisation at each successive temperature. This process reduces the dependence on the initialisation, which is otherwise a limitation of NMF and PLCA approaches. The method was tested on two standard multi-instrument transcription data sets (MIREX and Bach10). Experimental results show that the proposed method signiﬁcantly outperforms a state-of-the-art reference method, according to both frame-based and note-based metrics.

A wealth of research has been performed on the study of music and emotion, including emotion modelling and emotion classification. The emergence of online social tags (OST) has provided highly relevant information for the study of mood, as well as an important impetus for using discrete emotion terms in the study of continuous models of affect. Yet, the extent to which human annotation reveals either perceived emotion or induced emotion remains unknown. 80 musical excerpts were randomly selected from a collection of 2904 songs labelled with the Last.fm tags “happy”, “sad”, “angry” and “relax”. Forty-seven participants provided emotion ratings on the two continuous dimensions of valence and arousal for both perceived and induced emotion. Analysis of variance did not reveal significant differences in ratings between perceived emotion and induced emotion. Moreover, the results indicated that, regardless of the discrete type of emotion experienced, listeners’ ratings of perceived and induced emotion were highly positively correlated. Finally, the emotion tags “happy”, “sad” and “angry” but not “relax” predicted the corresponding experimentally provided emotion categories.;"Yading Song, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Simon Dixon, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Marcus Pearce, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Andrea Halpern, Bucknell University, USA, education";Queen Mary University of London, Queen Mary University of London, Queen Mary University of London, Bucknell University;education, education, education, education;GBR, GBR, GBR, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-26.685106;47.40221

Little attention has been paid however to how perceived emotion depends on cultural factors, such as listeners’ acculturation or familiarity with musical background or language. In this study, we examine this dependence in the context of Greek music. A large representative database of Greek songs has been created and sampled observing predeﬁned criteria such as the balance between Eastern and Western inﬂuenced musical genres. Listeners were then asked to rate songs according to their perceived mood. We collected continuous ratings of arousal and valence for short song excerpts and also asked participants to select a mood tag from a controlled mood vocabulary that best described the music. We analysed the consistency of ratings between Greek and non-Greek listeners and the relationships between the categorical and dimensional representations of emotions. Our results show that there is a greater agreement in listener’s judgements with Greek background compared to the group with varying background. These ﬁndings suggest valuable implications on the future development of mood prediction systems.;"Katerina Kosta, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Yading Song, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;György Fazekas, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Mark B.

Secondly, for the books for which it is possible (260 books), an OMR evaluation performed using the Aruspix OMR software application is presented. For each book, one randomly selected page of music was processed and the recognition rate was computed using a corrected transcription of the page. This evaluation shows very promising results for large-scale OMR on the EMO or similar collections.

As such, the corpus of jazz standards constitutes a unique opportunity to study a musical genre with a “closed-world” approach, since most jazz composers are no longer in activity today. Although many scores for jazz standards can be found on the Internet, no effort, to our knowledge, has been dedicated so far to building a comprehensive database of machine-readable scores for jazz standards. This paper reports on the rationale, design and population of such a database, containing harmonic (chord progressions) as well as melodic and structural information. The database can be used to feed both analysis and generation systems. We report on preliminary results in this vein. We get around the tricky and often unclear copyright issues imposed by the publishing industry, by providing only statistical information about songs. The completeness of such a database should benefit many research experiments in MIR and opens up novel and exciting applications in music generation exploiting symbolic information, notably in style modeling.;"François Pachet, Sony CSL, company;Jeff Suzda, Sony CSL, company;Daniel Martín, Sony CSL, company";Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Sony Computer Science Laboratories,Sony Computer Science Laboratories;company, company, company;FRA, FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;17.454277;-7.3536053

VirtualBand enables one or several musicians to interact in real-time with stylistically plausible virtual agents. The problem addressed is the generation of virtual agents, each representing the style of a given musician, while reacting to human players. We propose a generation framework that relies on feature-based interaction. Virtual agents exploit a style database, which consists of audio signals from which a set of MIR features are extracted. Musical interactions are represented by directed connections between agents through these features. The connections are themselves specified as mappings and database filters. We claim that such a connection framework allows to implement meaningful musical interactions and to produce stylistically consistent musical output.

One promising class of methods to accomplish this task is based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Such methods, however, are still far from perfect. Distinct pitches from a single instrument have similar timbre, similar note attacks, and contain overlapping harmonics that all make separation difficult. In an attempt to overcome these issues, we use a database of synthesized piano and guitar recordings to learn the harmonic structure of distinct pitches, perform NMF-based separation, and then extend the method to allow an end-user to interactively correct for errors in the output separation estimates by drawing on a piano roll display of the separated tracks. The user-annotations are mapped to linear grouping regularization parameters within a modified NMF-based algorithm and are then used to refine the separation estimates in an iterative manner. For evaluation, a prototype user-interface was built and used to separate several polyphonic guitar and piano recordings. Initial results show that the method of interactive feedback can significantly increase the separation quality and produce high-quality separation results.;"Nicholas J.

Tapping databases suffer from small size and often lack useful annotations about users and query cues.

The queries, collected from 60 users for 51 songs, contain both time stamps and pitch positions of tap events and are annotated with information about the user, such as musical training and familiarity with each excerpt.

In the ﬁeld of Music Information Retrieval, two-dimensional representations of the music signal are ubiquitous. Such representations are useful to display patterns of evidence that are not clearly revealed directly in the time domain. Among these representations, self-similarity matrices have become common representations for visualizing the time structure of an audio signal. In the context of organizing recordings, recent work has shown that, given a collection of recordings, it is possible to to group performances of the same musical work based on the pairwise similarity between structural representations of the audio signal.

"Sertan Sentürk;Sankalp Gulati;Xavier Serra";Score Informed Tonic Identification for Makam Music of Turkey.;2013;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416950;Tonic is a fundamental concept in many music traditions and its automatic identiﬁcation should be relevant for establishing the reference pitch when we analyse the melodic content of the music. In this paper, we present two methodologies for the identiﬁcation of the tonic in audio recordings of makam music of Turkey, both taking advantage of some score information. First, we compute a prominent pitch and a audio kernel-density pitch class distribution (KPCD) from the audio recording. The peaks in the KPCD are selected as tonic candidates. The ﬁrst method computes a score KPCD from the monophonic melody extracted from the score. Then, the audio KPCD is circular-shifted with respect to each tonic candidate and compared with the score KPCD. The best matching shift indicates the estimated tonic. The second method extracts the monophonic melody of the most repetitive section of the score. Normalising the audio prominent pitch with respect to each tonic candidate, the method attempts to link the repetitive structural element given in the score with the respective time-intervals in the audio recording. The result producing the most conﬁdent links marks the estimated tonic. We have tested the methods on a dataset of makam music of Turkey, achieving a very high accuracy (94.9%) with the ﬁrst method, and almost perfect identiﬁcation (99.6%) with the second method. We conclude that score informed tonic identiﬁcation can be a useful ﬁrst step in the computational analysis (e.g. expressive analysis, intonation analysis, audio-score alignment) of music collections involving melody-dominant content.;"Sertan S¸ent¨urk, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Sankalp Gulati, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Xavier Serra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education, education;ESP, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-20.471361;-12.338482

The intonation of scale degrees is quantiﬁed, based on pitch class proﬁles. An analysis procedure is introduced that consists of the following steps: 1) Pitch class histograms are calculated via non-parametric kernel smoothing. 2) Histogram peaks are detected. 3) Phrase ending analysis aids the ﬁnding of the tonic to align histogram peaks. 4) The theoretical scale degrees are mapped to the practical ones. 5) A schema of statistical tests detects signiﬁcant deviations of theoretical scale tuning from the estimated ones in performance practice. The analysis of 94 echoi shows a tendency of the singer to level theoretic particularities of the echos that stand out of the general norm in the octoechos: theoretically extremely large scale steps are diminished in performance.;"Maria Panteli, University of Cyprus, CYP, education;Hendrik Purwins, Berlin Institute of Technology, DEU, education; Aalborg University Copenhagen, DNK, education";University of Cyprus, Technische Universität Berlin;education, education;CYP, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-10.459691;-12.486908

The theme is given in a symbolic form that is searched for directly in an audio ﬁle. We present a dynamic programming algorithm that is related to an existing time-warp invariant algorithm. However, the new algorithm is computationally more efﬁcient than its predecessor, and it can also be used for approximate timescale invariant search. In the latter case the note durations in the query are taken into account, but some time jittering is allowed for. When dealing with audio, these are important properties because the number of possible note events is large and the note positions are not exact. We evaluate the algorithm using a collection of themes from Tchaikovsky’s symphonies. The new approximate timescaled algorithm seems to be a good choice for this setting.;"Antti Laaksonen, University of Helsinki, FIN, education;Kjell Lemström, Laurea University of Applied Sciences, FIN, education, University of Helsinki, FIN, education";University of Helsinki, Laurea University of Applied Sciences;education, education;FIN, FIN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-0.3850429;-5.5365386

We evaluate this method by comparing it to a system that infers the mood of a given track using associated tags only. SLP differs from conventional auto-tagging algorithms in that it maps audio features to a low-dimensional semantic layer congruent with the circumplex model of emotion, rather than training a model for each tag separately. We build the semantic layer using two large-scale data sets – crowd-sourced tags from Last.fm, and editorial annotations from the I Like Music (ILM) production music corpus – and use subsets of these corpora to train SLP for mapping audio features to the semantic layer. The performance of the system is assessed in predicting mood ratings on continuous scales in the two data sets mentioned above. The results show that audio is in general more efficient in predicting perceived mood than tags. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate the benefit of using a combination of semantic tags and audio features in automatic mood annotation.;"Pasi Saari, University of Jyväskylä, FIN, education;Tuomas Eerola, University of Jyväskylä, FIN, education;György Fazekas, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Mathieu Barthet, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Olivier Lartillot, University of Jyväskylä, FIN, education;Mark Sandler, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education";University of Jyväskylä, University of Jyväskylä, Queen Mary University of London, Queen Mary University of London, University of Jyväskylä, Queen Mary University of London;education, education, education, education, education, education;FIN, FIN, GBR, GBR, FIN, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-25.742506;49.186066

It often involves judgements and opinions from people of different background and level of musical expertise. Therefore, the resulting tags are usually subjective, ambiguous, and error-prone. To deal with this situation, we seek automatic methods to verify and monitor this process. Furthermore, because multiple tags can annotate each music piece, our task lends itself to multi-label methods which capture the inherent associations among annotations in a given music repository. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to verify the quality of music tag annotations via association analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a series of simulations using four publicly available music datasets.

Ideally, a map that a user is already familiar with should be altered as little as possible and only as much as necessary to reﬂect the changes of the underlying collection.

One of critical steps to do this task is to select important features for the detection. This paper presents two methods to evaluate feature importance, in which we compared nine available features based on a large user log in the real world. The set of features includes song metadata, acoustic feature, and user preference used by Collaborative Filtering techniques. The evaluation methods are designed from two views: i) the correlation between the estimated scores by song similarity in respect of a feature and the scores estimated by real play count, ii) feature selection methods over a binary classification problem, i.e., “like” or “dislike”. The experimental results show the user preference is the most important feature and artist similarity is of the second importance among these nine features.;"Yajie Hu, University of Miami, USA, education;Dingding Li, University of Miami, USA, education;Ogihara Mitsunori, University of Miami, USA, education";University of Miami, University of Miami, University of Miami;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-12.902396;22.744978
"Stéphane Dupont;Thierry Ravet";Improved Audio Classification Using a Novel Non-Linear Dimensionality Reduction Ensemble Approach.;2013;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417705;Two important categories of machine learning methodologies have recently attracted much interest in classiﬁcation research and its applications. On one side, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning allow to beneﬁt from the availability of larger sets of training data, even if not fully annotated with class labels, and of larger sets of diverse feature representations, through novel dimensionality reduction schemes. On the other side, ensemble methods allow to beneﬁt from more diversity in base learners though larger data and feature sets. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble learning approach making use of recent non-linear dimensionality reduction methods. More precisely, we apply t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to a large feature set to come up with embeddings of various dimensionality. A k-NN classiﬁer is then obtained for each embedding, leading to an ensemble whose estimates can then be combined, making use of various ensemble combination rules from the literature. The rationale of this approach resides in its potential capacity to better handle manifolds of different dimensionality in different regions of the feature space. We evaluate the approach on a transductive audio classiﬁcation task, where only part of the whole data set is labeled. We conﬁrm that dimensionality reduction by itself can improve performance (by 40% relative), and that creating an ensemble through the proposed approach further reduces classiﬁcation error rate by about 10% relative.;"Stéphane Dupont, University of Mons, BEL, education;Thierry Ravet, University of Mons, BEL, education";University of Mons, University of Mons;education, education;BEL, BEL;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;8.133429;26.61379

The approach uses a statistical framework to model two acoustic features: timbre and rhythm. A collection of tagged music is thus represented as a graph where the states correspond to the songs and the models probabilities are related to the timbric and rhythmic similarity. Under the assumption that acoustically similar songs have similar tags, we infer the tags of a new song by adding it to the graph structure and observing the tags visited in acoustically meaningful random walks.

Richard Polfreman;Comparing Onset Detection & Perceptual Attack Time.;2013;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415232;Accurate performance timing is associated with the perceptual attack time (PAT) of notes, rather than their physical or perceptual onsets (PhOT, POT). Since manual annotation of PAT for analysis is both time-consuming and impractical for real-time applications, automatic transcription is desirable. However, computational methods for onset detection in audio signals are conventionally measured against PhOT or POT data. This paper describes a comparison between PAT and onset detection data to assess whether in some circumstances they are similar enough to be equivalent, or whether additional models for PAT-PhOT difference are always necessary. Eight published onset algorithms, and one commercial system, were tested with five onset types in short monophonic sequences. Ground truth was established by multiple human transcription of the audio for PATs using rhythm adjustment with synchronous presentation, and parameters for each detection algorithm manually adjusted to produce the maximum agreement with the ground truth. Results indicate that for percussive attacks, a number of algorithms produce data close to or within the limits of human agreement and therefore may be substituted for PATs, while for non-percussive sounds corrective measures are necessary to match detector outputs to human estimates.;Dr Richard Polfreman, University of Southampton, GBR, education;University of Southampton;education;GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;45.719276;5.837948

Unsupervised machine learning methods are a powerful tool for studying how musical concepts may emerge from exposure to music. In this paper, we investigate to what degree tonal structure can be learned from musical data by unsupervised training of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine, a generative stochastic neural network. We show that even based on a limited set of musical data, the model learns several aspects of tonal structure. Firstly, the model learns an organization of musical material from different keys that conveys the topology of the circle of fifths (CoF). Although such a topology can be learned using principal component analysis (PCA) when using pitch-only representations, we found that using a pitch-duration representation impedes the extraction of the CoF topology much more for PCA than for the RBM. Furthermore, we replicate probe-tone experiments by Krumhansl and Shepard, measuring the organization of tones within a key in human perception.

In this work, we apply Convolutional Neural Networks to the task, trained directly on mel-scaled magnitude spectrograms. On a representative subset of the SALAMI structural annotation dataset, our method outperforms current techniques in terms of boundary retrieval F-measure at different temporal tolerances: We advance the state-of-the-art from 0.33 to 0.46 for tolerances of ±0.5 seconds, and from 0.52 to 0.62 for tolerances of ±3 seconds. As the algorithm is trained on annotated audio data without the need of expert knowledge, we expect it to be easily adaptable to changed annotation guidelines and also to related tasks such as the detection of song transitions.;"Karen Ullrich, Austrian Research Institute for Artiﬁcial Intelligence, AUT, facility;Jan Schlüter, Austrian Research Institute for Artiﬁcial Intelligence, AUT, facility;Thomas Grill, Austrian Research Institute for Artiﬁcial Intelligence, AUT, facility";Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence;facility, facility, facility;AUT, AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;6.8623805;18.28795

Using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), features are learned from performance data, after which these features are used to predict performed loudness. During feature learning, data describing more than 6000 musical pieces is used; when training for prediction, two datasets are used, both recorded on a B¨osendorfer piano (accurately measuring note onand offset times and velocity values), but describing different compositions performed by different pianists. The resulting model is tested by predicting note velocity for unseen performances. Our approach differs from earlier work in a number of ways: (1) an additional input representation based on a local history of velocity values is used, (2) the RBMs are trained to result in a network with sparse activations, (3) network connectivity is increased by adding skip-connections, and (4) more data is used for training. These modiﬁcations result in a network performing better than the state-of-the-art on the same data and more descriptive features, which can be used for rendering performances, or for gaining insight into which aspects of a musical piece inﬂuence its performance.";"Sam van Herwaarden, Austrian Research Institute for AI, AUT, facility;Maarten Grachten, Austrian Research Institute for AI, AUT, facility;W.

This is a challenging problem because ornaments are notes of a very short duration. The presented ornament detection system is based on ﬁrst detecting onsets and then exploiting the knowledge of musical ornamentation. We employed onset detection methods based on signal envelope and fundamental frequency and customised their parameters to the detection of soft onsets of possibly short duration. Single-note ornaments are detected based on the duration and pitch of segments, determined by adjacent onsets. Multi-note ornaments are detected based on analysing the sequence of segments. Experimental evaluations are performed on monophonic ﬂute recordings from Grey Larsen’s CD, which was manually annotated by an experienced ﬂute player.

MIDI allows for representing musical time information as specified by sheet music as well as physical time information that reflects performance aspects. However, in many of the available MIDI files the musical beat and tempo information is set to a preset value with no relation to the actual music content. In this paper, we introduce a procedure to determine the musical beat grid from a given performed MIDI file. As one main contribution, we show how the global estimate of the time signature can be used to correct local errors in the pulse grid estimation. Different to MIDI quantization, where one tries to map MIDI note onsets onto a given musical pulse grid, our goal is to actually estimate such a grid. In this sense, our procedure can be used in combination with existing MIDI quantization procedures to convert performed MIDI files into semantically enriched score-like MIDI files.;"Harald Grohganz, Bonn University, DEU, education;Michael Clausen, Bonn University, DEU, education;Meinard M¨uller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, company";University of Bonn,University of Bonn, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen;education, education, facility;DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;48.478218;17.20184

Current dictionary-based automatic transcription systems keep the input dictionary ﬁxed, thus the spectral shape of the dictionary components might not match the shape of the test instrument sources. By performing a conservative transcription pre-processing step, the spectral shape of detected notes can be extracted and utilized in order to adapt the template dictionary. We propose two variants for adaptive transcription, namely for single-instrument transcription and for multiple-instrument transcription.

Anna M. Kruspe;Keyword Spotting in A-capella Singing.;2014;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416870;Keyword spotting (or spoken term detection) is an interesting task in Music Information Retrieval that can be applied to a number of problems. Its purposes include topical search and improvements for genre classiﬁcation. Keyword spotting is a well-researched task on pure speech, but state-of-the-art approaches cannot be easily transferred to singing because phoneme durations have much higher variations in singing. To our knowledge, no keyword spotting system for singing has been presented yet. We present a keyword spotting approach based on keyword-ﬁller Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and test it on a-capella singing and spoken lyrics. We test Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefﬁcients (MFCCs), Perceptual Linear Predictive Features (PLPs), and Temporal Patterns (TRAPs) as front ends. These features are then used to generate phoneme posteriors using Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on speech data. The phoneme posteriors are then used as the system input. Our approach produces useful results on a-capella singing, but depend heavily on the chosen keyword. We show that results can be further improved by training the MLP on a-capella data. We also test two post-processing methods on our phoneme posteriors before the keyword spotting step. First, we average the posteriors of all three feature sets. Second, we run the three concatenated posteriors through a fusion classiﬁer.;Anna M.

There is an increasing need for such datasets, because the shift from physical to digital distribution in the music industry has given the listener access to a large body of music, which needs to be cataloged efﬁciently and be easily browsable. Additionally, deep learning and feature learning techniques are becoming increasingly popular for music information retrieval applications, and they typically require large amounts of training data to work well. In this paper, we propose to exploit an available large-scale music dataset, the Million Song Dataset (MSD), for classiﬁcation tasks on other datasets, by reusing models trained on the MSD for feature extraction. This transfer learning approach, which we refer to as supervised pre-training, was previously shown to be very effective for computer vision problems.

The dictionary learning uses NMF optimization across a training set of mixed signal utterances while keeping the vocal signal bases constant across the utterances. A soft mask is determined for each test mixed utterance frame by imposing sparseness constraints in the NMF partial co-factorization.

One approach is for human listeners to judge performance by listening to beat times mixed as clicks with music signals. The more common alternative is to compare beat times against ground truth annotations via one or more of the many objective evaluation measures. However, despite a large body of work in audio beat tracking, there is currently no consensus over which evaluation measure(s) to use, meaning multiple accuracy scores are typically reported. In this paper, we seek to evaluate the evaluation measures by examining the relationship between objective accuracy scores and human judgements of beat tracking performance. First, we present the raw correlation between objective scores and subjective ratings, and show that evaluation measures which allow alternative metrical levels appear more correlated than those which do not. Second, we explore the effect of parameterisation of objective evaluation measures, and demonstrate that correlation is maximised for smaller tolerance windows than those currently used.

Caetano;Frans Wiering";Theoretical Framework of A Computational Model of Auditory Memory for Music Emotion Recognition.;2014;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417211;The bag of frames (BOF) approach commonly used in music emotion recognition (MER) has several limitations. The semantic gap is believed to be responsible for the glass ceiling on the performance of BOF MER systems. However, there are hardly any alternative proposals to address it. In this article, we introduce the theoretical framework of a computational model of auditory memory that incorporates temporal information into MER systems. We advocate that the organization of auditory memory places time at the core of the link between musical meaning and musical emotions. The main goal is to motivate MER researchers to develop an improved class of systems capable of overcoming the limitations of the BOF approach and coping with the inherent complexity of musical emotions.;"Marcelo Caetano, Sound and Music Computing Group, INESC TEC, Portugal, facility;Frans Wiering, Dep.

"Thomas Prätzlich;Meinard Müller";Frame-Level Audio Segmentation for Abridged Musical Works.;2014;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1418039;Large-scale musical works such as operas may last several hours and typically involve a huge number of musicians. For such compositions, one often finds different arrangements and abridged versions (often lasting less than an hour), which can also be performed by smaller ensembles. Abridged versions still convey the flavor of the musical work containing the most important excerpts and melodies. In this paper, we consider the task of automatically segmenting an audio recording of a given version into semantically meaningful parts. Following previous work, the general strategy is to transfer a reference segmentation of the original complete work to the given version. Our main contribution is to show how this can be accomplished when dealing with strongly abridged versions. To this end, opposed to previously suggested segment-level matching procedures, we adapt a frame-level matching approach for transferring the reference segment information to the unknown version. Considering the opera “Der Freischütz” as an example scenario, we discuss how to balance out flexibility and robustness properties of our proposed frame-level segmentation procedure.;"Thomas Pratzlich, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, facility;Meinard Muller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, facility";International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen;facility, facility;DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;10.179519;14.566926
"Jonathan Driedger;Meinard Müller;Sascha Disch";Extending Harmonic-Percussive Separation of Audio Signals.;2014;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415226;In recent years, methods to decompose an audio signal into a harmonic and a percussive component have received a lot of interest and are frequently applied as a processing step in a variety of scenarios. One problem is that the computed components are often not of purely harmonic or percussive nature but also contain noise-like sounds that are neither clearly harmonic nor percussive. Furthermore, depending on the parameter settings, one often can observe a leakage of harmonic sounds into the percussive component and vice versa. In this paper we present two extensions to a state-of-the-art harmonic-percussive separation procedure to target these problems. First, we introduce a separation factor parameter into the decomposition process that allows for tightening separation results and for enforcing the components to be clearly harmonic or percussive. As second contribution, inspired by the classical sines+transients+noise (STN) audio model, this novel concept is exploited to add a third residual component to the decomposition which captures the sounds that lie in between the clearly harmonic and percussive sounds of the audio signal.;"Jonathan Driedger, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, education;Meinard M¨uller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, education;Sascha Disch, Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, DEU, facility";International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Fraunhofer IIS-A;facility, facility, facility;DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;44.339157;-16.284763
"Geoffroy Peeters;Victor Bisot";Improving Music Structure Segmentation using lag-priors.;2014;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1414764;Methods for music structure discovery usually process a music track by ﬁrst detecting segments and then labeling them. Depending on the assumptions made on the signal content (repetition, homogeneity or novelty), different methods are used for these two steps. In this paper, we deal with the segmentation in the case of repetitive content. In this ﬁeld, segments are usually identiﬁed by looking for sub-diagonals in a Self-Similarity-Matrix (SSM). In order to make this identiﬁcation more robust, Goto proposed in 2003 to cumulate the values of the SSM over constant-lag and search only for segments in the SSM when this sum is large. Since the various repetitions of a segment start simultaneously in a self-similarity-matrix, Serra et al. proposed in 2012 to cumulate these simultaneous values (using a so-called structure feature) to enhance the novelty of the starting and ending time of a segment. In this work, we propose to combine both approaches by using Goto method locally as a prior to the lag-dimensions of Serra et al. structure features used to compute the novelty curve. Through a large experiment on RWC and Isophonics testsets and using MIREX segmentation evaluation measure, we show that this simple combination allows a large improvement of the segmentation results.;"Geoffroy Peeters, STMS IRCAM-CNRS-UPMC, FRA, education;Victor Bisot, STMS IRCAM-CNRS-UPMC, FRA, education";IRCAM,IRCAM;facility, facility;FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;6.074976;10.613154

The algorithm is both tempoand transposition-invariant. We approach the problem by extending an existing tempo-invariant symbolic fingerprinting method, replacing the absolute pitch information in the fingerprints with a relative representation. Not surprisingly, this leads to a big decrease in the discriminative power of the fingerprints. To overcome this problem, we propose an additional verification step to filter out the introduced noise.

It chooses the model with the most appropriate beat activation function for the input signal and jointly models the tempo and phase of the beats from this activation function with a dynamic Bayesian network.

"Sanghoon Jun;Seungmin Rho;Eenjun Hwang";Geographical Region Mapping Scheme Based on Musical Preferences.;2014;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1418011;Many countries and cities in the world tend to have different types of preferred or popular music, such as pop, K-pop, and reggae. Music-related applications utilize geographical proximity for evaluating the similarity of music preferences between two regions. Sometimes, this can lead to incorrect results due to other factors such as culture and religion. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a scheme for constructing a music map in which regions are positioned close to one another depending on the similarity of the musical preferences of their populations. That is, countries or cities in a traditional map are rearranged in the music map such that regions with similar musical preferences are close to one another. To do this, we collect users’ music play history and extract popular artists and tag information from the collected data. Similarities among regions are calculated using the tags and their frequencies. And then, an iterative algorithm for rearranging the regions into a music map is applied. We present a method for constructing the music map along with some experimental results.;"Sanghoon Jun, Korea University, KOR, education;Seungmin Rho, Sungkyul University, KOR, education;Eenjun Hwang, Korea University, KOR, education";Korea University, Sungkyul University, Korea University;education, education, education;KOR, KOR, KOR;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;-28.879845;23.590027

"Peter van Kranenburg;Folgert Karsdorp";Cadence Detection in Western Traditional Stanzaic Songs using Melodic and Textual Features.;2014;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416172;Many Western songs are hierarchically structured in stanzas and phrases. The melody of the song is repeated for each stanza, while the lyrics vary. Each stanza is subdivided into phrases. It is to be expected that melodic and textual formulas at the end of the phrases offer intrinsic clues of closure to a listener or singer. In the current paper we aim at a method to detect such cadences in symbolically encoded folk songs. We take a trigram approach in which we classify trigrams of notes and pitches as cadential or as non-cadential. We use pitch, contour, rhythmic, textual, and contextual features, and a group of features based on the conditions of closure as stated by Narmour [11]. We employ a random forest classification algorithm. The precision of the classifier is considerably improved by taking the class labels of adjacent trigrams into account. An ablation study shows that none of the kinds of features is sufficient to account for good classification, while some of the groups perform moderately well on their own.;"Peter van Kranenburg, Meertens Institute, Netherlands, education;Folgert Karsdorp, Meertens Institute, Netherlands, education";Meertens Institute, Meertens Institute;facility, facility;NLD, NLD;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;22.240984;8.428893

Motor sequences are trained to achieve the perfect performances in musicians. Thus, the information from audio signal is not enough to understand the sensorimotor programming in players. Recently, the investigation of muscular activities of players during performance has attracted our interests. In this work, we propose a multi-channel system that records the audio sounds and electromyography (EMG) signal simultaneously and also develop algorithms to analyze the music performance and discover its relation to player’s motor sequences. The movement segment was first identified by the information of audio sounds, and the direction of violin bowing was detected by the EMG signal. Six features were introduced to reveal the variations of muscular activities during violin playing. With the additional information of the audio signal, the proposed work could efficiently extract the period and detect the direction of motor changes in violin bowing.

Using this approach, the likelihood function based on NMF is represented by a Poisson distribution and the NMF parameters, consisting of basis and weight matrices, are characterized by the exponential priors. A variational Bayesian expectation-maximization algorithm is developed to learn variational parameters and model parameters for monaural source separation. A clustering algorithm is performed to establish two groups of bases: one is for singing voice and the other is for background music. Model complexity is controlled by adaptively selecting the number of bases for different mixed signals according to the variational lower bound.

The T-F units are then clustered into three categories and the singing voice is synthesized from T-F units in the vocal category via time-frequency masking. The algorithm was tested using the MIR-1K dataset and demonstrated comparable results to other unsupervised masking approaches.

We consider a range of features describing the dynamic, spatial and spectral characteristics of each track, and perform a multidimensional analysis of variance to assess whether the instrument, song and/or engineer is the determining factor that explains the resulting variance, trend, or consistency in mixing methodology. A number of assumed mixing rules from literature are discussed in the light of this data, and implications regarding the automation of various mixing processes are explored. Part of the data used in this work is published in a new online multitrack dataset through which public domain recordings, mixes, and mix settings (DAW projects) can be shared.;"Brecht De Man, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Brett Leonard, The Graduate Program in Sound Recording, Schulich School of Music, McGill University, CAN, education; Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology, CAN, education;Richard King, The Graduate Program in Sound Recording, Schulich School of Music, McGill University, CAN, education; Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology, CAN, education;Joshua D.

One proposed solution is music prediction, wherein musical events are predicted in advance and transmitted to distributed musicians ahead of the network delay. We present a context-aware music prediction system focusing on expressive timing: a Bayesian network that incorporates stylistic model selection and linear conditional gaussian distributions on variables representing proportional tempo change. The system can be trained using rehearsals of distributed or co-located ensembles. We evaluate the model by comparing its prediction accuracy to two others: one employing only linear conditional dependencies between expressive timing nodes but no stylistic clustering, and one using only independent distributions for timing changes. The three models are tested on performances of a custom-composed piece that is played ten times, each in one of two styles. The results are promising, with the proposed system outperforming the other two. In predictable parts of the performance, the system with conditional dependencies and stylistic clustering achieves errors of 15ms; in more difficult sections, the errors rise to 100ms; and, in unpredictable sections, the error is too great for seamless timing emulation. Finally, we discuss avenues for further research and propose the use of predictive timing cues using our system.";"Bogdan Vera, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Elaine Chew, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education";Queen Mary University of London, Queen Mary University of London;education, education;GBR, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-23.882017;-19.347685

We train Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based models, as they are capable of capturing complex temporal structure present in symbolic music data. Similar to the function of language models in automatic speech recognition, we use the MLMs to generate a prior probability for the occurrence of a sequence. The acoustic AMT model is based on probabilistic latent component analysis, and prior information from the MLM is incorporated into the transcription framework using Dirichlet priors.

"Siying Wang;Sebastian Ewert;Simon Dixon";Robust Joint Alignment of Multiple Versions of a Piece of Music.;2014;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416382;Large music content libraries often comprise multiple versions of a piece of music. To establish a link between different versions, automatic music alignment methods map each position in one version to a corresponding position in another version. Due to the leeway in interpreting a piece, any two versions can differ signiﬁcantly, for example, in terms of local tempo, articulation, or playing style. For a given pair of versions, these differences can be significant such that even state-of-the-art methods fail to identify a correct alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that increases the robustness for difﬁcult to align cases. Instead of aligning only pairs of versions as done in previous methods, our method aligns multiple versions in a joint manner. This way, the alignment can be computed by comparing each version not only with one but with several versions, which stabilizes the comparison and leads to an increase in alignment robustness. Using recordings from the Mazurka Project, the alignment error for our proposed method was 14% lower on average compared to a stateof-the-art method, with signiﬁcantly less outliers (standard deviation 53% lower).;"Siying Wang, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Sebastian Ewert, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Simon Dixon, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education";Queen Mary University of London, Queen Mary University of London, Queen Mary University of London;education, education, education;GBR, GBR, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-14.628008;-32.538933
"Lucas Thompson;Simon Dixon;Matthias Mauch";Drum Transcription via Classification of Bar-Level Rhythmic Patterns.;2014;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417341;We propose a novel method for automatic drum transcription from audio that achieves the recognition of individual drums by classifying bar-level drum patterns. Automatic drum transcription has to date been tackled by recognising individual drums or drum combinations. In high-level tasks such as audio similarity, statistics of longer rhythmic patterns have been used, reﬂecting that musical rhythm emerges over time. We combine these two approaches by classifying bar-level drum patterns on sub-beat quantised timbre features using support vector machines. We train the classiﬁer using synthesised audio and carry out a series of experiments to evaluate our approach. Using six different drum kits, we show that the classiﬁer generalises to previously unseen drum kits when trained on the other ﬁve (80% accuracy). Measures of precision and recall show that even for incorrectly classiﬁed patterns many individual drum events are correctly transcribed. Tests on 14 acoustic performances from the ENST-Drums dataset indicate that the system generalises to real-world recordings. Limited by the set of learned patterns, performance is slightly below that of a comparable method. However, we show that for rock music, the proposed method performs as well as the other method and is substantially more robust to added polyphonic accompaniment.;"Lucas Thompson, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Matthias Mauch, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Simon Dixon, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education";Queen Mary University of London,Queen Mary University of London,Queen Mary University of London;education, education, education;GBR, GBR, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;54.47258;-32.398792

The primary aim of this paper is to investigate different fusion policies to combine existing onset detectors, thus achieving better results. Existing algorithms are fused using three strategies, first by combining different algorithms, second, by using the linear combination of detection functions, and third, by using a late decision fusion approach. Large scale evaluation was carried out on two published datasets and a new percussion database composed of Chinese traditional instrument samples. An exhaustive search through the parameter space was used enabling a systematic analysis of the impact of each parameter, as well as reporting the most generally applicable parameter settings for the onset detectors and the fusion.

Though it is part of the standard repertoire of analytical techniques, computational studies of Schenkerian analysis have been hindered by the lack of available data sets containing both musical compositions and ground-truth analyses of those compositions. Without such data sets, it is difﬁcult to empirically study the patterns that arise in analyses or rigorously evaluate the performance of intelligent systems for this kind of analysis. To combat this, we introduce the ﬁrst publicly available large-scale data set of computer-processable Schenkerian analyses. We discuss the choice of musical selections in the data set, the encoding of the music and the corresponding ground-truth analyses, and the possible uses of these data. As an example of the utility of the data set, we present an algorithm that transforms the Schenkerian analyses into hierarchically-organized data structures that are easily manipulated in software.;Phillip B.

There is, however, a need for a tool that can natively render the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) notation encodings that are increasingly used in music research projects. In this paper, we present Verovio, a library and toolkit for rendering MEI. A significant advantage of Verovio is that it implements MEI’s structure internally, making it the best suited solution for rendering features that make MEI unique. Verovio is designed as a fast, portable, lightweight tool written in pure standard C++ with no dependencies on third-party frameworks or libraries. It can be used as a command-line rendering tool, as a library, or it can be compiled to JavaScript using the Emscripten LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler. This last option is particularly interesting because it provides a complete in-browser music MEI typesetter. The SVG output from Verovio is organized in such a way that the MEI structure is preserved as much as possible. Since every graphic in SVG is an XML element that is easily addressable, Verovio is particularly well-suited for interactive applications, especially in web browsers.

The manner in which performance skills are improved depends on the particular instrument, and therefore, it is important to consider the unique characteristics of the target instrument. In this paper, we investigate the common mistakes of beginner flute players and propose a hierarchical approach to detect such mistakes. We first examine the structure and mechanism of the flute, and define several types of common mistakes that can be caused by incorrect assembly, poor blowing skills, or mis-fingering. We propose tailored algorithms for detecting each case by combining deterministic signal processing and deep learning, to quantify the quality of a flute sound. The system is structured hierarchically, as mis-fingering detection requires the input sound to be correctly assembled and blown to discriminate minor sound difference. Experimental results show that it is possible to identify different mistakes in flute performance using our proposed algorithms.;"Yoonchang Han, Seoul National University, KOR, education;Kyogu Lee, Seoul National University, KOR, education";Seoul National University, Seoul National University;education, education;KOR, KOR;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;25.223309;-34.32615

However, such temporal information is often disregarded in typical Music Information Retrieval modeling tasks of predicting higher-level cognitive or semantic aspects of music such as emotions, genre, and similarity. This paper addresses the specific hypothesis whether temporal information is essential for predicting expressed emotions in music, as a prototypical example of a cognitive aspect of music. We propose to test this hypothesis using a novel processing pipeline: 1) Extracting audio features for each track resulting in a multivariate ”feature time series”. 2) Using generative models to represent these time series (acquiring a complete track representation). Specifically, we explore the Gaussian Mixture model, Vector Quantization, Autoregressive model, Markov and Hidden Markov models. 3) Utilizing the generative models in a discriminative setting by selecting the Probability Product Kernel as the natural kernel for all considered track representations. We evaluate the representations using a kernel based model specifically extended to support the robust two-alternative forced choice self-report paradigm, used for eliciting expressed emotions in music. The methods are evaluated using two data sets and show increased predictive performance using temporal information, thus supporting the overall hypothesis.;"Jens Madsen, Technical University of Denmark, DNK, education;Bjørn Sand Jensen, Technical University of Denmark, DNK, education;Jan Larsen, Technical University of Denmark, DNK, education";Technical University of Denmark, Technical University of Denmark, Technical University of Denmark;education, education, education;DNK, DNK, DNK;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-28.32576;55.219036

More speciﬁcally, we investigate to what extent instrument-wise “playing” (P) and “non-playing” (NP) labels are informative in the synchronization process and what role the visual channel can have for the extraction of P/NP labels. After introducing the P/NP-based representation of the music piece, both at the score and performance level, we deﬁne an efﬁcient way of computing the distance between the two representations, which serves as input for the synchronization step based on dynamic time warping. In parallel with assessing the effectiveness of the proposed representation, we also study its robustness when missing and/or erroneous labels occur.

Its importance is reﬂected in the number of users who leave comments in the general neighborhood of drop events in music on online audio distribution platforms like SoundCloud. The variability that characterizes realizations of drop events in EDM makes automatic drop detection challenging.

We also explore the possibility of using the drop-related social comments on the SoundCloud platform as weak reference labels to improve drop detection. The method is evaluated using data from SoundCloud. Performance is measured as the overlap between tolerance windows centered around the hypothesized and the actual drop.

The incompleteness of data can hamper some important tasks, such as music and artist recommendation. In this scenario, transductive classiﬁcation can be used to classify the whole dataset considering just few labeled instances. Usually transductive classiﬁcation is performed through label propagation, in which data are represented as networks and the examples propagate their labels through their connections. Similarity-based networks are usually applied to model data as network. However, this kind of representation requires the deﬁnition of parameters, which signiﬁcantly affect the classiﬁcation accuracy, and presents a high cost due to the computation of similarities among all dataset instances. In contrast, bipartite heterogeneous networks have appeared as an alternative to similarity-based networks in text mining applications. In these networks, the words are connected to the documents which they occur. Thus, there is no parameter or additional costs to generate such networks. In this paper, we propose the use of the bipartite network representation to perform transductive classiﬁcation of music, using a bag-of-frames approach to describe music signals.

The method extends the systematic segmentation and representation of Sapp’s ‘keyscapes’ to the description stage, by introducing a set-class level of description. This provides a systematic, mid-level, and standard analytical lexicon, which allows the description of any notated music based on ﬁxed temperaments. The method beneﬁts from the representation completeness, the compromise between generalisation and discrimination of the set-class spaces, and the access to hierarchical inclusion relations over time. The proposed class-matrices are multidimensional time series encoding the pitch content of every possible music segment over time, regardless the involved time-scales, in terms of a given set-class space. They provide the simplest information mining methods with the ability of capturing sophisticated tonal relations.

These syllables are orally transmitted and often provide a language for percussion in those music cultures. Percussion patterns in these cultures thus have a well defined representation in the form of these syllables, which can be utilized in several computational percussion pattern analysis tasks. We explore a connected word speech recognition based framework that can effectively utilize the syllabic representation for automatic transcription and recognition of audio percussion patterns. In particular, we consider the case of Beijing opera and present a syllable level hidden markov model (HMM) based system for transcription and classification of percussion patterns. The encouraging classification results on a representative dataset of Beijing opera percussion patterns supports our approach and provides further insights on the utility of these syllables for computational description of percussion patterns.;"Ajay Srinivasamurthy, Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Rafael Caro Repetto, Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Harshavardhan Sundar, Speech and Audio Group, Indian Institute of Science, IND, education;Xavier Serra, Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Indian Institute of Science, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education, education, education;ESP, ESP, IND, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developing economies, Developed economies;23.045227;-3.8390357

Flamenco songs belonging to the same style are characterized by a common melodic skeleton, which is subject to spontaneous improvisation containing strong prolongations and ornamentations. For our research we collected human similarity judgements from na¨ıve and expert listeners who listened to audio recordings of a cappella ﬂamenco performances as well as synthesized versions of the same songs. We furthermore calculated distances from manually extracted high-level descriptors deﬁned by ﬂamenco experts. The suitability of a set of computational melodic similarity measures was evaluated by analyzing the correlation between computed similarity and human ratings. We observed signiﬁcant differences between listener groups and stimuli types. Furthermore, we observed a high correlation between human ratings and similarities computed from features from ﬂamenco experts. We also observed that computational models based on temporal deviation, dynamics and ornamentation are better suited to model perceived similarity for this material than models based on chroma distance.;"N.

State-of-the-art score alignment systems estimate note onsets with a low time resolution, and without detecting note offsets. For applications such as score-informed source separation we need a precise alignment at note level. Thus, we propose a novel method that reﬁnes alignment by determining the note onsets and offsets in complex orchestral mixtures by combining audio and image processing techniques. First, we introduce a note-wise pitch salience function that weighs the harmonic contribution according to the notes present in the score. Second, we perform image binarization and blob detection based on connectivity rules. Then, we pick the best combination of blobs, using dynamic programming. We ﬁnally obtain onset and offset times from the boundaries of the most salient blob. We evaluate our method on a dataset of Bach chorales, showing that the proposed approach can accurately estimate note onsets and offsets.;"Marius Miron, Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Julio Jos´e Carabias-Orti, Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Jordi Janer, Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra,Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education, education;ESP, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-11.5317335;-31.392878

In Beijing opera, the presence of a two-dialectal tone system makes the tone-melody relationship more complex. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach to analyze syllable-sized tone-pitch contour similarity in a corpus of Beijing Opera (381 arias) with statistical modeling and machine learning methods. A total number of 1,993 pitch contour units and attributes were extracted from a selection of 20 arias. We then build Smoothing Spline ANOVA models to compute matrixes of average melodic contour curves by tone category and other attributes. A set of machine learning and statistical analysis methods are applied to 30-point pitch contour vectors as well as dimensionality-reduced representations using Symbolic Aggregate approXimation(SAX). The results indicate an even mixture of shapes within all tone categories, with the absence of evidence for a predominant dialectal tone system in Beijing opera.

However, such predictions are difficult to make accurately due to the complex nature of music tastes. In this paper, we review the literature on music tastes from social psychology and sociology of music to identify the correlates of music tastes and to understand how music tastes are formed and evolve through time. Research shows associations between music preferences and a wide variety of sociodemographic and individual characteristics, including personality traits, values, ethnicity, gender, social class, and political orientation. It also reveals the importance of social influences on music tastes, more specifically from family and peers, as well as the central role of music tastes in the construction of personal and social identities.

Using chord vocabularies of differing complexity as well as segmentation measures, the new scheme provides more information than the ACE evaluations from previous years. With this new information, however, comes new interpretive challenges. What are the correlations among different songs and, more importantly, different submissions across the new measures? Performance falls off for all submissions as the vocabularies increase in complexity, but does it do so directly in proportion to the number of more complex chords, or are certain algorithms indeed more robust? What are the outliers, song-algorithm pairs where the performance was substantially higher or lower than would be predicted, and how can they be explained? Answering these questions requires moving beyond the Friedman tests that have most often been used to compare algorithms to a richer underlying model. We propose a logistic-regression approach for generating comparative statistics for ACE, supported with generalised estimating equations (GEE) to correct for repeated measures.

Rhythm in EDM is built on the concept of a ‘loop’, a repeating sequence typically associated with a four-measure percussive pattern. The presented model calculates rhythm similarity between segments of EDM in the following steps. 1) Each segment is split in different perceptual rhythmic streams. 2) Each stream is characterized by a number of attributes, most notably: attack phase of onsets, periodicity of rhythmic elements, and metrical distribution. 3) These attributes are combined into one feature vector for every segment, after which the similarity between segments can be calculated. The stages of stream splitting, onset detection and downbeat detection have been evaluated individually, and a listening experiment was conducted to evaluate the overall performance of the model with perceptual ratings of rhythm similarity.;"Maria Panteli, University of Amsterdam, NLD, education;Niels Bogaards, Elephantcandy, NLD, company;Aline Honingh, University of Amsterdam, NLD, education";University of Amsterdam, Elephantcandy, University of Amsterdam;education, company, education;NLD, NLD, NLD;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;41.120125;25.517591

"Zhiyao Duan;David Temperley";Note-level Music Transcription by Maximum Likelihood Sampling.;2014;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416534;Note-level music transcription, which aims to transcribe note events (often represented by pitch, onset and offset times) from music audio, is an important intermediate step towards complete music transcription. In this paper, we present a note-level music transcription system, which is built on a state-of-the-art frame-level multi-pitch estimation (MPE) system. Preliminary note-level transcription achieved by connecting pitch estimates into notes often lead to many spurious notes due to MPE errors. In this paper, we propose to address this problem by randomly sampling notes in the preliminary note-level transcription. Each sample is a subset of all notes and is viewed as a notelevel transcription candidate. We evaluate the likelihood of each candidate using the MPE model, and select the one with the highest likelihood as the ﬁnal transcription. The likelihood treats notes in a transcription as a whole and favors transcriptions with less spurious notes. Experiments conducted on 110 pieces of J.S. Bach chorales with polyphony from 2 to 4 show that the proposed sampling scheme signiﬁcantly improves the transcription performance from the preliminary approach. The proposed system also signiﬁcantly outperforms two other state-of-the-art systems in both frame-level and note-level transcriptions.;"Zhiyao Duan, University of Rochester, USA, education;David Temperley, University of Rochester, USA, education";University of Rochester, University of Rochester;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;16.784973;-22.12626

One approach involves applying non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to an observed magnitude spectrogram, interpreted as a non-negative matrix. The other approach is based on the concept of computational auditory scene analysis (CASA). A CASA-based approach called the “harmonic-temporal clustering (HTC)” aims to cluster the time-frequency components of an observed signal based on a constraint designed according to the local time-frequency structure common in many sound sources (such as harmonicity and the continuity of frequency and amplitude modulations). This paper proposes a new approach for monaural source separation called the “Harmonic-Temporal Factor Decomposition (HTFD)” by introducing a spectrogram model that combines the features of the models employed in the NMF and HTC approaches. We further describe some ideas how to design the prior distributions for the present model to incorporate musically relevant information into the separation scheme.;"Tomohiko Nakamura, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education; NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, JPN, company;Kotaro Shikata, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education;Norihiro Takamune, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education;Hirokazu Kameoka, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education; NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, JPN, company";University of Tokyo, NTT Corporation, University of Tokyo, University of Tokyo, University of Tokyo, NTT Corporation;education, company, education, education, education, company;JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;41.345154;-22.011045

The singer’s formant is defined as a prominent spectral-envelope peak around 3 kHz found in the singing of professional Western opera singers [3]. In this paper we introduce a novel melody extraction algorithm based on this feature for opera signals. At the front end, it automatically detects the singer’s formant according to the Long-Term Average Spectrum (LTAS). This detection function is also applied to the short-term spectrum in each frame to determine the melody. The Fan Chirp Transform (FChT) [4] is used to compute pitch salience as its high time-frequency resolution overcomes the difficulties introduced by vibrato. Subharmonic attenuation is adopted to handle octave errors which are common in opera vocals. We improve the FChT algorithm so that it is capable of correcting outliers in pitch detection. The performance of our method is compared to 5 state-ofthe-art melody extraction algorithms on a newly created dataset and parts of the ADC2004 dataset. Our algorithm achieves an accuracy of 87.5% in singer’s formant detection. In the evaluation of melody extraction, it has the best performance in voicing detection (91.6%), voicing false alarm (5.3%) and overall accuracy (82.3%).;"Zheng Tang, University of Washington, USA, education;Dawn A.

While our original hypotheses were largely connected to cultural components of mood perception, we also analyzed how stable mood assignments were when listeners could read the lyrics of recent popular English songs they were hearing versus when they only heard the songs. We also showed the lyrics of some songs to participants without playing the recorded music. We conclude that people assign different moods to the same song in these three scenarios. People tend to assign a song to the mood cluster that includes “melancholy” more often when they read the lyrics without listening to it, and having access to the lyrics does not help reduce the difference in music mood perception between Canadian and Chinese listeners significantly. Our results cause us to question the idea that songs have “inherent mood”. Rather, we suggest that the mood depends on both cultural and experiential context.;"Abhishek Singhi, University of Waterloo, CAN, education;Daniel G.

We achieve an accuracy level of 67% for lyrics, 80% for articles and 57% for poetry. Using these probability distribution we show that adjectives more likely to be used in lyrics are more rhymable than those more likely to be used in poetry, but they do not differ significantly in their semantic orientations. Furthermore we show that our algorithm is successfully able to detect poetic lyricists like Bob Dylan from non-poetic ones like Bryan Adams, as their lyrics are more often misclassified as poetry.;"Abhishek Singhi, University of Waterloo, CAN, education;Daniel G.

At present most melody segmentation models rely on a ‘single strategy’ (i.e. they model a single perceptual segmentation cue). However, cognitive studies suggest that multiple cues need to be considered. In this paper we thus propose and evaluate a ‘multi-strategy’ system to automatically segment symbolically encoded melodies. Our system combines the contribution of different single strategy boundary detection models. First, it assesses the perceptual relevance of a given boundary detection model for a given input melody; then it uses the boundaries predicted by relevant detection models to search for the most plausible segmentation of the melody. We use our system to automatically segment a corpus of instrumental and vocal folk melodies. We compare the predictions to human annotated segments, and to state of the art segmentation methods.

Since conventional lyrics retrieval systems are based on simple word search, those systems often fail to reﬂect user’s intention behind a query when a word given as a query can be used in different contexts. For example, the word“tears”can appear not only in sad songs (e.g., feel heartrending), but also in happy songs (e.g., weep for joy). To overcome this limitation, we propose to automatically analyze and visualize topics of lyrics by using a well-known text analysis method called latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). This enables LyricsRadar to offer two types of topic visualization. One is the topic radar chart that visualizes the relative weights of ﬁve latent topics of each song on a pentagon-shaped chart. The other is radar-like arrangement of all songs in a two-dimensional space in which song lyrics having similar topics are arranged close to each other.

The “phrase” in this paper means a short audio excerpt that is not limited to a main melody (singing part) and is usually played by a single musical instrument. A main problem of this task is that the query is often buried in mixture signals consisting of various instruments. To solve this problem, we propose a method that can appropriately calculate the distance between a query and partial components of a musical piece. More speciﬁcally, gamma process nonnegative matrix factorization (GaP-NMF) is used for decomposing the spectrogram of the query into an appropriate number of basis spectra and their activation patterns. Semi-supervised GaP-NMF is then used for estimating activation patterns of the learned basis spectra in the musical piece by presuming the piece to partially consist of those spectra. This enables distance calculation based on activation patterns.

Conventionally, dynamic time warping (DTW) and left-to-right hidden Markov models (HMMs) have often been used for audio-to-audio alignment based on a shallow acoustic similarity between performances. Those methods, however, cannot distinguish latent musical structures common to all performances and temporal dynamics unique to each performance. To solve this problem, our model explicitly represents two state sequences: a top-level sequence that determines the common structure inherent in the music itself and a bottom-level sequence that determines the actual temporal ﬂuctuation of each performance. These two sequences are fused into a hierarchical Bayesian HMM and can be learned at the same time from the given performances. Since the top-level sequence assigns the same state for note combinations that repeatedly appear within a piece of music, we can unveil the latent structure of the piece. Moreover, we can easily compare different performances of the same piece by analyzing the bottom-level sequences.

While existing work mostly focused on playing technique detection for individual single notes, this paper attempts to expand this endeavor to recordings of guitar solo tracks. Specifically, we treat the task as a time sequence pattern recognition problem, and develop a two-stage framework for detecting five fundamental playing techniques used by the electric guitar. Given an audio track, the first stage identifies prominent candidates by analyzing the extracted melody contour, and the second stage applies a pre-trained classifier to the candidates for playing technique detection using a set of timbre and pitch features. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on a new dataset comprising of 42 electric guitar solo tracks without accompaniment, each of which covers 10 to 25 notes. The best average F-score achieves 74% in two-fold cross validation.

However, unlike onset detection, offset detection has seldom been the subject of an in-depth study in the music information retrieval community, possibly because of the ambiguity involved in the determination of offset times in music. This paper presents a preliminary study aiming at discussing ways to annotate and to evaluate offset times for pitched non-percussive instruments. Moreover, we conduct a case study of offset detection in violin recordings by evaluating a number of energy, spectral flux, and pitch based methods using a new dataset covering 6 different violin playing techniques. The new dataset, which is going to be shared with the research community, consists of 63 violin recordings that are thoroughly annotated based on perceptual loudness and note transition. The offset detection methods, which are adapted from well-known methods for onset detection, are evaluated using an onset-aware method we propose for this task. Result shows that the accuracy of offset detection is highly dependent on the playing techniques involved.

Content descriptions are explanations of classical music compositions that help a person to understand technical aspects of the music. Recently, Kuribayashi et al. proposed a method for obtaining content descriptions from the web. However, the content descriptions on a single page frequently explain a specific part of a composition only. Therefore, a person who wants to fully understand the composition suffers from a time-consuming task, which seems almost impossible for a novice of classical music. To integrate the content descriptions obtained from multiple pages, we propose a method for aligning each pair of paragraphs of such descriptions. Using dynamic time warping-based method along with our new ideas, (a) a distribution-based distance measure named w2DD, and (b) the concept of passage expressions, it is possible to align content descriptions of classical music better than when using cutting-edge text analysis methods.

The system creates a variety of blends combining elements of the penultimate chords of two input cadences and it further estimates the expected relationships between the produced blends. Then, a preliminary subjective evaluation of the proposed blending system is presented. A pairwise dissimilarity listening test was conducted using original and blended cadences as stimuli. Subsequent multidimensional scaling analysis produced spatial conﬁgurations for both behavioural data and dissimilarity estimations by the algorithm. Comparison of the two conﬁgurations showed that the system is capable of making fair predictions of the perceived dissimilarities between the blended cadences.

In this paper the descriptive potential of the GCT is assessed in the tonal idiom by comparing GCT harmonic labels with human expert annotations (Kostka & Payne harmonic dataset).

Recent research has explored the explicit modeling of characteristic rhythmic patterns as a way to improve upon existing beat-tracking algorithms, which typically fail on dealing with syncopated or polyrhythmic music. This work takes the Uruguayan Candombe drumming (an afro-rooted rhythm from Latin America) as a case study. After analyzing the aspects that make this music genre troublesome for usual algorithmic approaches and describing its basic rhythmic patterns, the paper proposes a supervised scheme for rhythmic pattern tracking that aims at finding the metric structure from a Candombe recording, including beat and downbeat phases. Then it evaluates and compares the performance of the method with those of general-purpose beat-tracking algorithms through a set of experiments involving a database of annotated recordings totaling over two hours of audio. The results of this work reinforce the advantages of tracking rhythmic patterns (possibly learned from annotated music) when it comes to automatically following complex rhythms. A software implementation of the proposal as well as the annotated database utilized are available to the research community with the publication of this paper.;"Leonardo Nunes, ATL-Brazil, Microsoft, company;Martín Rocamora, Universidad de la República, URY, education;Luis Jure, Universidad de la República, URY, education;Luiz W.

Arthur Flexer;Improving Visualization of High-Dimensional Music Similarity Spaces.;2015;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416472;Visualizations of music databases are a popular form of interface allowing intuitive exploration of music catalogs. They are often based on lower dimensional projections of high dimensional music similarity spaces. Such similarity spaces have already been shown to be negatively impacted by so-called hubs and anti-hubs. These are points that appear very close or very far to many other data points due to a problem of measuring distances in high-dimensional spaces. We present an empirical study on how this phenomenon impacts three popular approaches to compute two-dimensional visualizations of music databases. We also show how the negative impact of hubs and anti-hubs can be reduced by re-scaling the high dimensional spaces before low dimensional projection.;Arthur Flexer, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, AUT, facility;Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence;facility;AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-36.85042;2.6125326

Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained on spectrogram features and human annotations have been successfully used to tackle the problem, but still fall clearly behind human performance. We expand on the CNN approach by combining spectrograms with self-similarity lag matrices as audio features, thereby capturing more facets of the underlying structural information. Furthermore, in order to consider the hierarchical nature of structural organization, we explore different strategies to learn from the two-level annotations of main and secondary boundaries available in the SALAMI structural annotation dataset. We show that both measures improve boundary recognition performance, resulting in a significant improvement over the previous state of the art. As a side-effect, our algorithm can predict boundaries on two different structural levels, equivalent to the training data.;"Thomas Grill, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI), Vienna, Austria, facility;Jan Schlüter, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI), Vienna, Austria, facility";Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence;facility, facility;AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;6.6700225;18.603859

Using the problem of singing voice detection with neural networks as an example, we apply a range of label-preserving audio transformations to assess their utility for music data augmentation. In line with recent research in speech recognition, we find pitch shifting to be the most helpful augmentation method. Combined with time stretching and random frequency filtering, we achieve a reduction in classification error between 10 and 30%, reaching the state of the art on two public datasets.

Equivalent onset refers to the hidden onset that can functionally replace the onsets of the notes in a chord; onset span refers to the time interval from the first note onset to the last note onset. We ask two research questions. First, what is the equivalent onset of a rolled chord? Second, are the onset spans of different chords interpreted in the same way?

For corresponding chunks of audio between different versions of the same song, these point clouds are approximately rotated, translated, and scaled copies of each other.

The technique is implemented using a Bayesian classifier, which is trained using an audio dataset containing individual scores provided by a committee of expert listeners.

Kruspe;"Training Phoneme Models for Singing with ""Songified"" Speech Data.";2015;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416858;Speech recognition in singing is a task that has not been widely researched so far. Singing possesses several characteristics that differentiate it from speech. Therefore, algorithms and models that were developed for speech usually perform worse on singing. One of the bottlenecks in many algorithms is the recognition of phonemes in singing. We noticed that this recognition step can be improved when using singing data in model training, but to our knowledge, there are no large datasets of singing data annotated with phonemes. However, such data does exist for speech. We therefore propose to make phoneme recognition models more robust for singing by training them on speech data that has artiﬁcially been made more “song-like”. We test two main modiﬁcations on speech data: Time stretching and pitch shifting. Artiﬁcial vibrato is also tested.

The algorithm decomposes the music signal into two dictionaries: a percussive dictionary initialized with pre-defined drum templates and a harmonic dictionary initialized with undefined entries. The harmonic dictionary is adapted to the non-percussive music content in a standard NMF procedure. The percussive dictionary is adapted to each individual signal in an iterative scheme: it is fixed during the decomposition process, and is updated based on the result of the previous convergence. Two template adaptation methods are proposed to provide more flexibility and robustness in the case of unknown data.

We implement methods to compare chord progressions between two songs on the basis of their optimal local alignment scores.

The second task queries the set of songs with fabricated chord progressions, ranks each query’s results across ground-truth and extracted chord labels, and returns rank correlations.

While these methods perform effectively due to the minimal assumptions they place on the nature of the sampled pitch temporal trajectories, their practical applicability to retrieval tasks on real-world databases is seriously limited by their prohibitively large computational complexity. While dimensionality reduction of the time-series to discrete symbol strings is a standard approach that can exploit computational gains from the data compression as well as the availability of efficient string matching algorithms, the compressed representation of the pitch time series itself is not well understood given the pervasiveness of pitch inflections in the melodic shape of the raga phrases. We propose methods that are informed by domain knowledge to design the representation and to optimize parameter settings for the subsequent string matching algorithm. The methods are evaluated in the context of an audio query based search for Hindustani vocal compositions in audio recordings via the mukhda (refrain of the song). We present results that demonstrate performance close to that achieved by time-series matching but at orders of magnitude reduction in complexity.;"Kaustuv Kanti Ganguli, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education;Abhinav Rastogi, Stanford University, USA, education;Vedhas Pandit, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education;Prithvi Kantan, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education;Preeti Rao, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education";IIT Bombay, Stanford University, IIT Bombay,IIT Bombay,IIT Bombay;education, education, education, education, education;IND, USA, IND, IND, IND;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developed economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;-16.40685;-13.398718

The audience determines the identity of r¯agas within a few seconds of listening to an item. Most of the audience consists of people who are only avid listeners and not performers. In this paper, an attempt is made to mimic the listener. A r¯aga veriﬁcation framework is therefore suggested. The r¯aga veriﬁcation system assumes that a speciﬁc r¯aga is claimed based on similarity of movements and motivic patterns. The system then checks whether this claimed r¯aga is correct. For every r¯aga, a set of cohorts are chosen. A r¯aga and its cohorts are represented using pallavi lines of compositions. A novel approach for matching, called Longest Common Segment Set (LCSS), is introduced. The LCSS scores for a r¯aga are then normalized with respect to its cohorts in two different ways. The resulting systems and a baseline system are compared for two partitionings of a dataset. A dataset of 30 r¯agas from Charsur Foundation 1 is used for analysis. An equal error rate (EER) of 12% is obtained.;"Shrey Dutta, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, IND, education;Krishnaraj Sekhar PV, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, IND, education;Hema A.

This task is one of many necessary in optical music recognition. Our approach treats the score system as the basic unit of processing. A graph structure describes the possible orderings of instruments in the system. Each instrument may apply to several staves, may be represented with several possible text strings, and may appear at several possible positions relative to the staves. We ﬁnd the optimal labeling of staves using a globally optimal dynamic programming approach that embeds simple template-based optical character recognition within the overall recognition scheme. When given an entire score, we simultaneously optimize on the text labeling for each system, as well as the character template models, thus adapting to the font at hand. Our implementation alternately optimizes over the text label identiﬁcation and re-estimates the character templates. Experiments are presented on 10 different scores showing a signiﬁcant improvement due to adaptation.;"Yucong Jiang, Indiana University, Bloomington, USA, education;Christopher Raphael, Indiana University, Bloomington, USA, education";Indiana University Bloomington, Indiana University Bloomington;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-2.8286695;-56.575764

Our approach represents the notes and rests in a system measure as the vertices of a graph. We connect the graph by adding voice edges and coincidence edges between pairs of vertices, while the rhythmic interpretation follows simply from the connected graph. The graph identification problem is cast as an optimization where each potential edge is scored according to its plausibility. We seek the optimally scoring graph where the score is represented as a sum of edge scores.

Given a target and a source recording, the goal of audio mosaicing is to generate a mosaic recording that conveys musical aspects (like melody and rhythm) of the target, using sound components taken from the source. In this work, we propose a novel approach for automatically generating audio mosaics with the objective to preserve the source’s timbre in the mosaic. Inspired by algorithms for non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), our idea is to use update rules to learn an activation matrix that, when multiplied with the spectrogram of the source recording, resembles the spectrogram of the target recording. However, when applying the original NMF procedure, the resulting mosaic does not adequately reflect the source’s timbre. As our main technical contribution, we propose an extended set of update rules for the iterative learning procedure that supports the development of sparse diagonal structures in the activation matrix. We show how these structures better retain the source’s timbral characteristics in the resulting mosaic.;"Jonathan Driedger, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, facility;Thomas Prätzlich, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, facility;Meinard Müller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, facility";International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen;facility, facility, facility;DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;18.900183;-27.996937

Specifically, we aim to estimate the drummers’ swing ratio in excerpts of jazz recordings taken from the Weimar Jazz Database. A first approach is based on automatic detection of ride cymbal (RC) onsets and evaluation of relative time intervals between them. However, small errors in the onset detection propagate considerably into the swing ratio estimates. As our main technical contribution, we propose to use the log-lag autocorrelation function (LLACF) as a mid-level representation for estimating swing ratios, circumventing the error-prone detection of RC onsets. In our experiments, the LLACF-based swing ratio estimates prove to be more reliable than the ones based on RC onset detection. Therefore, the LLACF seems to be the method of choice to process large amounts of jazz recordings.

Proposed methodologies focus either on specific aspects of harmony (e.g., generating abstract chord symbols) or incorporate the determination of many harmonic characteristics in a single probabilistic generative scheme. This paper addresses the problem of assigning voice leading focussing on the bass voice, i.e., the realisation of the actual bass pitches of an abstract chord sequence, under the scope of a modular melodic harmonisation system where different aspects of the generative process are arranged by different modules. The proposed technique defines the motion of the bass voice according to several statistical aspects: melody voice contour, previous bass line motion, bass-to-melody distances and statistics regarding inversions and note doublings in chords. The aforementioned aspects of voicing are modular, i.e., each criterion is defined by independent statistical learning tools. Experimental results on diverse music idioms indicate that the proposed methodology captures efficiently the voice layout characteristics of each idiom, whilst additional analyses on separate statistically trained modules reveal distinctive aspects of each idiom. The proposed system is designed to be flexible and adaptable (for instance, for the generation of novel blended melodic harmonisations).;"Dimos Makris, Ionian University, GRC, education;Maximos Kaliakatsos-Papakostas, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GRC, education;Emilios Cambouropoulos, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GRC, education";Ionian University, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki;education, education, education;GRC, GRC, GRC;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-13.183662;-22.708302

In this paper we present an alternative approach. First, different performances of the piece in question are collected and aligned (off-line) to the symbolic score. Then, multiple instances of the on-line tracking algorithm (each using a different performance as a reference) are used to follow the live performance, and their output is combined to come up with the current position in the score. As the evaluation shows, this strategy improves both the robustness and the precision, especially on pieces that are generally hard to track (e.g. pieces with extreme, abrupt tempo changes, or orchestral pieces with a high degree of polyphony).

BSS is the problem of recovering several sources, given only a mixture. VD is the problem of automatically identifying the parts in a mixed audio signal, where at least one person is singing. We compare the results of three different strategies for utilising the estimated singing voice signals from four state-of-the-art source separation algorithms. In order to assess the performance of those strategies on an internal data set, we use two different feature sets, each fed to two different classifiers. After selecting the most promising approach, the results on two publicly available data sets are presented. In an additional experiment, we use the improved VD for a simple post-processing technique: For the final estimation of the source signals, we decide to use either silence, or the mixed, or the separated signals, according to the VD.

One popular example is the bar pointer model, which enables joint inference of these rhythmic parameters from a piece of music. While this allows the mutual dependencies between these parameters to be exploited, it also increases the computational complexity of the models. In this paper, we propose a new state-space discretisation and tempo transition model for this class of models that can act as a drop-in replacement and not only increases the beat and downbeat tracking accuracy, but also reduces time and memory complexity drastically.

Recently, kernel additive modeling with generalized spatial Wiener filtering (GW) was presented for music/voice separation. In this paper, an adaptive auditory filtering based on β-order minimum mean-square error spectral amplitude estimation (bSA) is applied to the kernel additive modeling for improving the singing voice separation performance from monaural music signal. The proposed algorithm is composed of five modules: short time Fourier transform, music/voice separation based on bSA, determination of back-fitting, back-fitting, and inverse short time Fourier transform. In the proposed method, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based factorized spectral amplitude exponent β for each kernel component is adaptively calculated for effective bSA-based auditory filtering performance during kernel back-fitting. Using a back-fitting threshold, the kernel back-fitting process can automatically be iteratively performed until convergence.

If the spectral envelope of an isolated sound is represented by an all-pole ﬁlter, linear predictive coding (LPC) can be used for ﬁlter estimation in the linear-frequency domain. The main problem of LPC is that although only the amplitudes of harmonic partials are reliable samples drawn from the spectral envelope, the whole spectrum is used for ﬁlter estimation. To solve this problem, we propose an inﬁnite superimposed discrete all-pole (iSDAP) model that, given a music signal, can estimate an appropriate number of superimposed harmonic structures whose harmonic partials are drawn from a limited number of spectral envelopes. Our nonparametric Bayesian source-ﬁlter model is formulated in the log-frequency domain that better suits the frequency characteristics of human audition.

This has resulted in a corpus that exhibits an extreme amount of variation, even among tunes with the same name. In addition, the same tune or tune segment may appear under several different names. Previous attempts at building systems for automated retrieval and ranking of instrumental dance tunes perform well for near-exact matching of tunes, but do not work as well in retrieving and ranking, in order of most to least similar, variants of a tune; especially those with variations as extreme as this particular corpus.

Our study explored this relationship using a new methodology: genre dispersion among people’s mobile-phone music collections. By analyzing the download behaviours of genre-deﬁned user subgroups, we investigated the following questions: (1) do genre-preferring subgroups show distinct patterns of genre consumption and genre exclusivity; (2) does genre exclusivity relate to Big Five personality factors? We hypothesized that genre-preferring subgroups would vary in genre exclusivity, and that their degree of exclusivity would be linearly associated with the openness personality factor (if people have open personalities, they should be “open” to different musical styles). Consistent with our hypothesis, results showed that greater genre inclusivity, i.e. many genres in people’s music collections, positively associated with openness and (unexpectedly) agreeableness, suggesting that individuals with high openness and agreeableness have wider musical tastes than those with low openness and agreeableness.

Therefore, a deeper understanding of the workings of these factors is critical for advanced expressive synthesis and computer-aided music education. In this paper, we propose the novel task of automatic expressive musical term classification as a direct means to study the interpretational factors. Specifically, we consider up to 10 expressive musical terms, such as Scherzando and Tranquillo, and compile a new dataset of solo violin excerpts featuring the realization of different expressive terms by different musicians for the same set of classical music pieces. Under a score-informed scheme, we design and evaluate a number of note-level features characterizing the interpretational aspects of music for the classification task. Our evaluation shows that the proposed features lead to significantly higher classification accuracy than a baseline feature set commonly used in music information retrieval tasks. Moreover, taking the contrast of feature values between an expressive and its corresponding non-expressive version (if given) of a music piece greatly improves the accuracy in classifying the presented expressive one.

Previous work in automatic arrangement of music only used symbolic scores to achieve a particular musical style; our challenge is to also consider audio features of the target popular song.

We describe the performance as a hierarchical process of performer’s progression in the score and the production of performed notes, and represent the process as an extension of the hidden semi-Markov model. The model is compared with a previously studied model based on hidden Markov model (HMM), and reasons are given that the present model is advantageous for score following especially for scores with trills, tremolos, and arpeggios. This is also confirmed empirically by comparing the accuracy of score following and analysing the errors.

Unlike previous studies which merely generate mashups by overlaying music segments on one single base track, the proposed system creates mashups with multiple background (e.g. instrumental) and lead (e.g. vocal) track segments. So, besides the suitability between the vertically overlaid tracks (i.e. vertical mashability) used in previous studies, we proposed to further consider the suitability between the horizontally connected consecutive music segments (i.e. horizontal mashability) when searching for proper music segments to be combined. On the vertical side, two new factors: “harmonic change balance” and “volume weight” have been considered. On the horizontal side, the methods used in the studies of medley creation are incorporated. Combining vertical and horizontal mashabilities together, we defined four levels of mashability that may be encountered and found the proper solution to each of them. Subjective evaluations showed that the proposed four levels of mashability can appropriately reflect the degrees of listening enjoyment.

Looking toward trends in other machine perception domains, one might conclude that complex, data-driven methods have the potential to significantly advance the state of the art. Two recent efforts did exactly this for large-vocabulary ACE, but despite arguably achieving some of the highest results to date, both approaches plateau well short of having solved the problem. Therefore, this work explores the behavior of these two high performing, systems as a means of understanding obstacles and limitations in chord estimation, arriving at four critical observations: one, music recordings that invalidate tacit assumptions about harmony and tonality result in erroneous and even misleading performance; two, standard lexicons and comparison methods struggle to reflect the natural relationships between chords; three, conventional approaches conflate the competing goals of recognition and transcription to some undefined degree; and four, the perception of chords in real music can be highly subjective, making the very notion of “ground truth” annotations tenuous. Synthesizing these observations, this paper offers possible remedies going forward, and concludes with some perspectives on the future of both ACE research and the field at large.";"Eric J.

For example, the Melodia melody extraction algorithm employs a pitch contour selection stage that relies on a number of heuristics for selecting the melodic output. In this paper we explore the use of a discriminative model to perform purely data-driven melodic contour selection. Specifically, a discriminative binary classifier is trained to distinguish melodic from non-melodic contours. This classifier is then used to predict likelihoods for a track’s extracted contours, and these scores are decoded to generate a single melody output. The results are compared with the Melodia algorithm and with a generative model used in a previous study. We show that the discriminative model outperforms the generative model in terms of contour classification accuracy, and the melody output from our proposed system performs comparatively to Melodia.

However, typical algorithmic approaches to structural annotation produce ﬂat temporal partitions of a track, which are commonly evaluated against a similarly ﬂat, human-produced annotation. Evaluating structure analysis as represented by ﬂat annotations effectively discards all notions of structural depth in the evaluation. Although collections of hierarchical structure annotations have been recently published, no techniques yet exist to measure an algorithm’s accuracy against these rich structural annotations. In this work, we propose a method to evaluate structural boundary detection with hierarchical annotations.

MIDI guitars are useful tools for various purposes from inputting MIDI data to enjoying a jam session system, but existing MIDI guitars do not have sufficient accuracy in converting the performance to an MIDI form. In this paper, we make an attempt on improving the accuracy of a MIDI guitar by integrating it with an audio transcription method based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). First, we investigate an NMF-based algorithm for transcribing guitar performances. Although the NMF is a promising method, an effective post-process (i.e., converting the NMF’s output to an MIDI form) is a non-trivial problem. We propose use of a neural network for this conversion. Next, we investigate a method for integrating the outputs of the MIDI guitar and NMF. Because they have different tendencies in wrong outputs, we take an policy of outputting only common parts in the two outputs. Experimental results showed that the F-score of our method was 0.626 whereas those of the MIDI-guitar-only and NMF-and-neural-network-only methods were 0.347 and 0.526, respectively.;"Masaki Otsuka, Graduate School of Integrated Basic Sciences, Nihon University, JPN, education;Tetsuro Kitahara, Graduate School of Integrated Basic Sciences, Nihon University, JPN, education";Nihon University, Nihon University;education, education;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;8.001846;-30.04694

Two variants are presented: without temporal constraints and with hidden Markov model-based constraints controlling the appearance of sound states. Experiments are performed on benchmark transcription datasets: MAPS, TRIOS, MIREX multiF0, and Bach10; results on multi-pitch detection and instrument assignment show that the proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art for multiple-instrument transcription and is more than 20 times faster compared to a previous sound state-based model.

To obtain pitch estimates we used the Tony software’s automatic transcription and manual correction tools. Pitch accuracy was measured in terms of pitch error and interval error. We show that singers’ pitch accuracy correlates significantly with self-reported singing skill and musical training. Larger intervals led to larger errors, and the tritone interval in particular led to average errors of one third of a semitone. Note duration (or inter-onset interval) had a significant effect on pitch accuracy, with greater accuracy on longer notes.

We also describe how varying the way the model interprets rests in the input music affects the resulting analyses produced.;"Phillip B. Kirlin, Rhodes College, USA, education;David L.

"Jeongsoo Park;Kyogu Lee";Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation Using Harmonicity and Sparsity Constraints.;2015;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417323;In this paper, we propose a novel approach to harmonic-percussive sound separation (HPSS) using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with sparsity and harmonicity constraints. Conventional HPSS methods have focused on temporal continuity of harmonic components and spectral continuity of percussive components. However, it may not be appropriate to use them to separate time-varying harmonic signals such as vocals, vibratos, and glissandos, as they lack in temporal continuity. Based on the observation that the spectral distributions of harmonic and percussive signals differ – i.e., harmonic components have harmonic and sparse structure while percussive components are broadband – we propose an algorithm that successfully separates the rapidly time-varying harmonic signals from the percussive ones by imposing different constraints on the two groups of spectral bases. Experiments with real recordings as well as synthesized sounds show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional methods.;"Jeongsoo Park, Seoul National University, KOR, education;Kyogu Lee, Seoul National University, KOR, education";Seoul National University, Seoul National University;education, education;KOR, KOR;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;44.489517;-16.64769
"Emmanuel Deruty;François Pachet";The MIR Perspective on the Evolution of Dynamics in Mainstream Music.;2015;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417995;Understanding the evolution of mainstream music is of high interest for the music production industry. In this context, we argue that a MIR perspective may be used to highlight, in particular, relations between dynamics and various properties of mainstream music. We illustrate this claim with two results obtained from a diachronic analysis performed on 7200 tracks released between 1967 and 2014. This analysis suggests that 1) the so-called “loudness war” has peaked in 2007, and 2) its influence has been important enough to override the impact of genre on dynamics. In other words, dynamics in mainstream music are primarily related to a track’s year of release, rather than to its genre.;"Emmanuel Deruty, Sony Computer Science Laboratory / Akoustic Arts, FRA, company;François Pachet, Sony Computer Science Laboratory, FRA, company";Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Sony Computer Science Laboratories;company, company;FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-62.84883;4.210515

Collaborations between MIR and neuroscience researchers, however, are still rare, and to date only a few studies using approaches from one domain have successfully reached an audience in the other. In this paper, we take an initial step toward bridging these two ﬁelds by reviewing studies from the music neuroscience literature, with an emphasis on imaging modalities and analysis techniques that might be of practical interest to the MIR community. We show that certain approaches currently used in a neuroscientiﬁc setting align with those used in MIR research, and discuss implications for potential areas of future research. We additionally consider the impact of disparate research objectives between the two ﬁelds, and how such a discrepancy may have hindered cross-discipline output thus far. It is hoped that a heightened awareness of this literature will foster interaction and collaboration between MIR and neuroscience researchers, leading to advances in both ﬁelds that would not have been achieved independently.;"Blair Kaneshiro, Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, Stanford University, USA, education;Jacek P.

Hendrik Schreiber;Improving Genre Annotations for the Million Song Dataset.;2015;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1414760;Any automatic music genre recognition (MGR) system must show its value in tests against a ground truth dataset. Recently, the public dataset most often used for this purpose has been proven problematic, because of mislabeling, duplications, and its relatively small size. Another dataset, the Million Song Dataset (MSD), a collection of features and metadata for one million tracks, unfortunately does not contain readily accessible genre labels. Therefore, multiple attempts have been made to add song-level genre annotations, which are required for supervised machine learning tasks. Thus far, the quality of these annotations has not been evaluated. In this paper we present a method for creating additional genre annotations for the MSD from databases, which contain multiple, crowd-sourced genre labels per song (Last.fm, beaTunes). Based on label co-occurrence rates, we derive taxonomies, which allow inference of top-level genres. These are most often used in MGR systems. We then combine multiple datasets using majority voting. This both promises a more reliable ground truth and allows the evaluation of the newly generated and pre-existing datasets. To facilitate further research, all derived genre annotations are publicly available on our website.;Hendrik Schreiber, tagtraum industries incorporated, USA, company;tagtraum industries;company;USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-18.826712;28.142897

Musical excerpts are analyzed using an optimized, partially ﬁxed Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) method and beat histogram features are calculated on basis of the resulting activation functions for each one out of three drum tracks extracted (Hi-Hat, Snare Drum and Bass Drum). The features are evaluated on two widely used genre datasets (GTZAN and Ballroom) using standard classiﬁcation methods, concerning the achieved overall classiﬁcation accuracy. Furthermore, their suitability in distinguishing between rhythmically similar genres and the performance of the features resulting from individual activation functions is discussed. Results show that the presented NMF-based beat histogram features can provide comparable performance to other classiﬁcation systems, while considering strictly drum patterns.;"Athanasios Lykartsis, Technische Universität Berlin, DEU, education;Chih-Wei Wu, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, education;Alexander Lerch, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, education";Technische Universität Berlin, Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology;education, education, education;DEU, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;6.9635286;37.54841
"Igor Vatolkin;Günter Rudolph;Claus Weihs";Evaluation of Album Effect for Feature Selection in Music Genre Recognition.;2015;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416328;With an increasing number of available music characteristics, feature selection becomes more important for various categorisation tasks, helping to identify relevant features and remove irrelevant and redundant ones. Another advantage is the decrease of runtime and storage demands. However, sometimes feature selection may lead to “over-optimisation” when data in the optimisation set is too different from data in the independent validation set. In this paper, we extend our previous work on feature selection for music genre recognition and focus on so-called “album effect” meaning that optimised classification models may overemphasize relevant characteristics of particular artists and albums rather than learning relevant properties of genres. For that case we examine the performance of classification models on two validation sets after the optimisation with feature selection: the first set with tracks not used for training and feature selection but randomly selected from the same albums, and the second set with tracks selected from other albums. As it can be expected, the classification performance on the second set decreases. Nevertheless, in almost all cases the feature selection remains beneficial compared to complete feature sets and a baseline using MFCCs, if applied for an ensemble of classifiers, proving robust generalisation performance.;"Igor Vatolkin, TU Dortmund, DEU, education;Günter Rudolph, TU Dortmund, DEU, education;Claus Weihs, TU Dortmund, DEU, education";Technische Universität Dortmund, Technische Universität Dortmund, Technische Universität Dortmund;education, education, education;DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;0.6969399;28.611158

Due to data availability, there also has been a strong bias towards analyzing piano performances, in which local timing, dynamics and articulation are important expressive performance features. In this paper, we consider the problem of analyzing multiple performances of the same symphonic piece, performed by different orchestras and different conductors. While differences between interpretations in this genre may include commonly studied features on timing, dynamics and articulation, the timbre of the orchestra and choices of balance within the ensemble are other important aspects distinguishing different orchestral interpretations from one another. While it is hard to model these higher-level aspects as explicit audio features, they can usually be noted visually in spectrogram plots. We therefore propose a method to compare orchestra performances by examining visual spectrogram characteristics. Inspired by eigenfaces in human face recognition, we apply Principal Components Analysis on synchronized performance fragments to localize areas of cross-performance variation in time and frequency. We discuss how this information can be used to examine performer differences, and how beyond pairwise comparison, relative differences can be studied between multiple performances in a corpus at once.;"Cynthia C.

The development of innovative real-life applications that draw on MIR technology requires a user-centered design and development approach that assesses user needs and aligns them with technological and academic ambitions in the MIR domain. In this paper we present such an approach, and apply it to the development of technological applications to enrich classical symphonic concerts. A user-driven approach is particularly important in this area, as orchestras need to innovate the concert experience to meet the needs and expectations of younger generations without alienating the current audience. We illustrate this approach with the results of five focus groups for three audience segments, which allow us to formulate informed user requirements for classical concert applications.;"Mark S.

Compared with previous NMF based techniques, this one does not aim at factorizing the time-frequency representation of the entire musical signal into a combination of the possible set of notes. Instead, the proposed algorithm proceeds iteratively by initially decomposing a part of the time-frequency representation into a combination of a small subset of all possible notes then reinvesting this information in the following step involving a large subset of notes. Specifically, starting with the lowest octave of notes that is of interest, each iteration increases the set of notes under consideration by an octave. The resolution of a lower dimensionality problem used to properly initialize matrices for a more complex problem, results in a gain of some percent in the transcription accuracy.;"Anis Khlif, ´Ecole des Mines ParisTech, France, education;Vidhyasaharan Sethu, University of New South Wales, Australia, education";Telecom ParisTech, University of New South Wales;education, education;FRA, AUS;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;15.7682085;-30.030737

Two sinusoidal models in our earlier work are employed in the above-mentioned system to represent piano tones: the General Model and the Piano Model. The General Model, a variant of sinusoidal modeling, can represent a single tone with high modeling quality, yet it fails to separate mixtures of tones due to the overlapping partials. The Piano Model, on the other hand, is an instrument-specific model tailored for piano. Its modeling quality is lower but it can learn from training data (consisting entirely of isolated tones), resolve the overlapping partials and thus separate the mixtures. We formulate a new hierarchical Bayesian framework to run both Models in the source separation process so that the mixtures with overlapping partials can be separated with high quality. The results show that our proposed system gives robust and accurate separation of piano tone signal mixtures (including octaves) while achieving significantly better quality than those reported in related work done previously.;"Wai Man SZETO, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, CHN, education;Kin Hong WONG, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, CHN, education";The Chinese University of Hong Kong, The Chinese University of Hong Kong;education, education;HKG, HKG;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;40.60053;-23.435938

Evolution of musical tune families has been studied qualitatively for over a century, but quantitative analysis has been hampered by an inability to objectively distinguish between musical similarities that are due to chance and those that are due to descent from a common ancestor. Here we propose an automated method to identify tune families by adapting genetic sequence alignment algorithms designed for automatic identification and alignment of protein families. We tested the effectiveness of our method against a high-quality ground-truth dataset of 26 folk tunes from four diverse tune families (two English, two Japanese) that had previously been identified and aligned manually by expert musicologists. We tested different combinations of parameters related to sequence alignment and to modeling of pitch, rhythm, and text to find the combination that best matched the ground-truth classifications. The best-performing automated model correctly grouped 100% (26/26) of the tunes in terms of overall similarity to other tunes, identifying 85% (22/26) of these tunes as forming distinct tune families. The success of our approach on a diverse, cross-cultural ground-truth dataset suggests promise for future automated reconstruction of musical evolution on a wide scale.;"Patrick E.

The automatic identification of cover songs is useful for a wide range of tasks, from fans looking for new versions of their favorite songs to organizations involved in licensing copyrighted songs. This is a difficult task given that a cover may differ from the original song in key, timbre, tempo, structure, arrangement and even language of the vocals. Cover song identification has attracted some attention recently. However, most of the state-of-the-art approaches are based on similarity search, which involves a large number of similarity computations to retrieve potential cover versions for a query recording. In this paper, we adapt the idea of time series shapelets for content-based music retrieval.

Social jukeboxes are systems that enable social music listening with listeners collaboratively choosing the music to be played. Naturally, because music tastes are diverse, using social jukeboxes often involves conﬂicting interests. Because of that, virtually all social jukeboxes incorporate conﬂict management mechanisms. In contrast with their widespread use, however, little attention has been given to evaluating how different conﬂict management mechanisms function to preserve the positive experience of music listeners. This paper presents an experiment with three conﬂict management mechanisms and three groups of listeners. The mechanisms were chosen to represent those most commonly used in the state of the practice.

While the proposed models can be adapted to different musical styles, the applicability of these flexible methods so far is limited because the application of exact inference is computationally demanding. More efficient approximate inference algorithms using particle filters (PF) can be developed to overcome this limitation.

We then propose Particle Filter based inference schemes for both the original model and the simplification. We compare the results obtained from exact and approximate inference in terms of meter tracking accuracy as well as in terms of computational demands.

We propose an abstraction process and a complexity weighting scheme which improve melodic similarity by exploiting speciﬁc melodic characteristics in this music. In addition, we propose a tetrachord normalization to handle transposed phrase occurrences. The melodic abstraction is based on the partial transcription of the steady regions in the melody, followed by a duration truncation step. The proposed complexity weighting accounts for the differences in the melodic complexities of the phrases, a crucial aspect known to distinguish phrases in Carnatic music. For evaluation we use over 5 hours of audio data comprising 625 annotated melodic phrases belonging to 10 different phrase categories. Results show that the proposed melodic abstraction and complexity weighting schemes significantly improve the phrase detection accuracy, and that tetrachord normalization is a successful strategy for dealing with transposed phrase occurrences in Carnatic music.

Existing similarity metrics tend to consider our perception of rhythms as being in time without discriminating the importance of some regions over others. In a previously reported experiment we observed that measures of similarity may differ given the presence or absence of a pulse inducing sound and the importance of those measures is not constant along the pattern. These results are now reinterpreted by reﬁning the previously proposed metrics. We consider that the perceptual contribution of each beat to the measured similarity is non-homogeneous but might indeed depend on the temporal positions of the beat along the bar. We show that with these improvements, the correlation between the previously evaluated experimental similarity and predictions based on our metrics increases substantially.

"Georgi Dzhambazov;Sertan Sentürk;Xavier Serra";Searching Lyrical Phrases in A-Capella Turkish Makam Recordings.;2015;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417921;Search by lyrics, the problem of locating the exact occurrences of a phrase from lyrics in musical audio, is a recently emerging research topic. Unlike key-phrases in speech, lyrical key-phrases have durations that bear important relation to other musical aspects like the structure of a composition. In this work we propose an approach that address the differences of syllable durations, specific for singing. First a phrase is expanded to MFCC-based phoneme models, trained on speech. Then, we apply dynamic time warping between the phrase and audio to estimate candidate audio segments in the given audio recording. Next, the retrieved audio segments are ranked by means of a novel score-informed hidden Markov model, in which durations of the syllables within a phrase are explicitly modeled. The proposed approach is evaluated on 12 a-capella audio recordings of Turkish Makam music. Relying on standard speech phonetic models, we arrive at promising results that outperform a baseline approach unaware of lyrics durations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work tackling the problem of search by lyrical key-phrases. We expect that it can serve as a baseline for further research on singing material with similar musical characteristics.;"Georgi Dzhambazov, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Sertan S¸ent¨urk, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Xavier Serra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education, education;ESP, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-21.605492;-10.820023

To better control this decomposition, NMF has been extended using prior knowledge and parametric models. In fact, using score information considerably improved separation results. Nevertheless, one of the main problems of using score information is the misalignment between the score and the actual performance. A potential solution to this problem is the use of audio to score alignment systems. However, most of them rely on a tolerance window that clearly affects the separation results. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method to refine the aligned score at note level by detecting both, onset and offset for each note present in the score. Note refinement is achieved by detecting shapes and contours in the estimated instrument-wise time activation (gains) matrix. Decomposition is performed in a supervised way, using training instrument models and coarsely-aligned score information. The detected contours define time-frequency note boundaries, and they increase the sparsity. Finally, we have evaluated our method for informed source separation using a dataset of Bach chorales obtaining satisfactory results, especially in terms of SIR.;"Marius Miron, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Julio José Carabias-Orti, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Jordi Janer, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education, education;ESP, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;41.557484;-23.481483

In the current paper, we study the potential of MIR techniques for supporting and enhancing musicological descriptions of the singing style of two of the most renowned jingju schools for the dan role-type, namely Mei and Cheng schools. To this aim, from the characteristics commonly used for describing singing style in musicological literature, we have selected those that can be studied using standard audio features. We have selected eight recordings from our jingju music research corpus and have applied current algorithms for the measurement of the selected features. Obtained results support the descriptions from musicological sources in all cases but one, and also add precision to them by providing specific measurements. Besides, our methodology suggests some characteristics not accounted for in our musicological sources.

We test this approach on a corpus of 188 artist biographies and a slightly larger dataset of 2,336 artists, both gathered from Last.fm. The former is mapped to the MIREX Audio and Music Similarity evaluation dataset, so that its similarity judgments can be used as ground truth.

In both cases, the goal can be to obtain mostly monophonic units, but streams with polyphonic data are also relevant. These algorithms usually cluster contiguous notes with close pitches.

In particular, we propose the use of sound source separation techniques as a pre-processing step of the mixing process. In addition to an initial solo and accompaniment separation step, the proposed mixing framework is composed of six processing blocks: harmonic-percussive separation (HPS), cross-adaptive multi-track scaling (CAMTS), cross-adaptive equalizer (CAEQ), cross-adaptive dynamic spectral panning (CADSP), automatic excitation (AE), and time-frequency selective panning (TFSP). The effects of the different processing steps in the final quality of the mix are evaluated through a listening test procedure.

This is a challenging problem due to the soft nature of onsets and short durations of ornaments. The proposed automatic transcription system is based on hidden Markov models, with separate models being built for notes and for single-note ornaments.

Experimental evaluations are performed on monophonic flute recordings from Grey Larsen’s CD. The performance of the system is evaluated in terms of the transcription of notes as well as detection of onsets.

Subsequently, we evaluate standard combination rules for merging these single classiﬁers into a composite classiﬁer based on global features.

For combining the latter chroma-based classiﬁers with the composite classiﬁer based on global features, we use standard rank aggregation methods adapted from the information retrieval literature. We evaluate performance with the Second Hand Song dataset, where we quantify performance using multiple statistics.

"Bochen Li;Zhiyao Duan";Score Following for Piano Performances with Sustain-Pedal Effects.;2015;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1418127;One challenge in score following (i.e., mapping audio frames to score positions in real time) for piano performances is the mismatch between audio and score caused by the usage of the sustain pedal. When the pedal is pressed, notes played will continue to sound until the string vibration naturally ceases. This makes the notes longer than their notated lengths and overlap with later notes. In this paper, we propose an approach to address this problem. Given that the most competitive wrong score positions for each audio frame are the ones before the correct position due to the sustained sounds, we remove partials of sustained notes and only retain partials of “new notes” in the audio representation. This operation reduces sustain-pedal effects by weakening the match between the audio frame and previous wrong score positions, hence encourages the system to align to the correct score position. We implement this idea based on a state-of-the-art score following framework.

The goal of this study was to explore which components of the decision process are affected when exposed to music; we do so within the context of a stochastic sequential model of simple decisions, the drift-diffusion model (DDM). In our experiment, participants decided whether words were emotionally positive or negative while listening to music that was chosen to induce positive or negative mood. The behavioral results show that the music manipulation was effective, as participants were biased to label words positive in the positive music condition. The DDM shows that this bias was driven by a change in the starting point of evidence accumulation, which indicates an a priori response bias. In contrast, there was no evidence that music affected how participants evaluated the emotional content of the stimuli.

We present a strategy for the corpus analysis of audio data that is optimized for interpretable results. The approach brings two previously unexplored concepts to the audio domain: audio bigram distributions, and the use of corpus-relative or “second-order” descriptors. To test the real-world applicability of our method, we present an experiment in which we model song recognition data collected in a widely-played music game. By using the proposed corpus analysis pipeline we are able to present a cognitively adequate analysis that allows a model interpretation in terms of the listening history and experience of our participants. We find that our corpus-based audio features are able to explain a comparable amount of variance to symbolic features for this task when used alone and that they can supplement symbolic features profitably when the two types of features are used in tandem.

In this paper we discuss the problems associated with this approach and propose to move to bigger time resolutions when tracking emotion over time. We argue that it is more natural from the listener’s point of view to regard emotional variation in music as a progression of emotionally stable segments. In order to enable such tracking of emotion over time it is necessary to segment music at the emotional boundaries. To address this problem we conduct a formal evaluation of different segmentation methods as applied to a task of emotional boundary detection. We collect emotional boundary annotations from three annotators for 52 musical pieces from the RWC music collection that already have structural annotations from the SALAMI dataset. We investigate how well structural segmentation explains emotional segmentation and find that there is a large overlap, though about a quarter of emotional boundaries do not coincide with structural ones. We also study inter-annotator agreement on emotional segmentation. Lastly, we evaluate different unsupervised segmentation methods when applied to emotional boundary detection and find that, in terms of F-measure, the Structural Features method performs best.;"Anna Aljanaki, Utrecht University, NLD, education;Frans Wiering, Utrecht University, NLD, education;Remco C.

While characteristic musical features that define ragtime as a genre have been debated since its inception, musicologists argue that specific syncopation patterns are most typical for this genre. Therefore, we investigate the use of syncopation patterns in the RAG-collection from its beginnings until the present time in this paper. Using computational methods, this paper provides an overview on the use of rhythmical patterns of the ragtime genre, thereby offering valuable new insights that complement musicological hypotheses about this genre. Specifically, we measure the amount of syncopation for each bar using Longuet-Higgins and Lee’s model of syncopation, determine the most frequent rhythmic patterns, and discuss the role of a specific short-long-short syncopation pattern that musicologists argue is characteristic for ragtime. A comparison between the ragtime (pre-1920) and modern (post-1920) era shows that the two eras differ in syncopation pattern use. Onset density and amount of syncopation increase after 1920. Moreover, our study confirms the musicological hypothesis on the important role of the short-long-short syncopation pattern in ragtime. These findings are pivotal in developing ragtime genre-specific features.;"Hendrik Vincent Koops, Utrecht University, NLD, education;Anja Volk, Utrecht University, NLD, education;W.

In this paper, we propose new datasets and investigate signal processing algorithms for multipitch estimation (MPE) in choral and symphony music, which have been seldom considered in AMT research. We observe that MPE in these two types of music is challenging because of not only the high polyphony number, but also the possible imprecision in pitch for notes sung or played by multiple singers or musicians in unison. To improve the robustness of pitch estimation, experiments show that it is beneﬁcial to measure pitch saliency by jointly considering frequency, periodicity and harmonicity information. Moreover, we can improve the localization and stability of pitch by the multi-taper methods and nonlinear time-frequency reassignment techniques such as the Concentration of Time and Frequency (ConceFT) transform.

Our approach extends Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for audio modeling by including local estimates of frequency modulation as cues in the separation. This permits the modeling and unsupervised separation of vibrato or glissando musical sources, which is not possible with the basic matrix factorization formulation. The algorithm factorizes a sparse nonnegative tensor comprising the audio spectrogram and local frequency-slope-to-frequency ratios, which are estimated at each time-frequency bin using the Distributed Derivative Method. The use of local frequency modulations as separation cues is motivated by the principle of common fate partial grouping from Auditory Scene Analysis, which hypothesizes that each latent source in a mixture is characterized perceptually by coherent frequency and amplitude modulations shared by its component partials.

Consequently, the task of meter tracking is of great importance for the domain of Music Information Retrieval. In our contribution, we specifically focus on Indian art musics, where meter is conceptualized at several hierarchical levels, and a diverse variety of metrical hierarchies exist, which poses a challenge for state of the art analysis methods. To this end, for the first time, we combine Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), allowing to transcend manually tailored signal representations, with subsequent Dynamic Bayesian Tracking (BT), modeling the recurrent metrical structure in music. Our approach estimates meter structures simultaneously at two metrical levels. The results constitute a clear advance in meter tracking performance for Indian art music, and we also demonstrate that these results generalize to a set of Ballroom dances. Furthermore, the incorporation of neural network output allows a computationally efficient inference.

Computationally modelling this phenomenon is an open problem, especially when processing expressive shaping of the music such as tempo change. To meet this challenge we propose Adaptive Frequency Neural Networks (AFNNs), an extension of Gradient Frequency Neural Networks (GFNNs). GFNNs are based on neurodynamic models and have been applied successfully to a range of difficult music perception problems including those with syncopated and polyrhythmic stimuli. AFNNs extend GFNNs by applying a Hebbian learning rule to the oscillator frequencies. Thus the frequencies in an AFNN adapt to the stimulus through an attraction to local areas of resonance, and allow for a great dimensionality reduction in the network. Where previous work with GFNNs has focused on frequency and amplitude responses, we also consider phase information as critical for pulse perception. Evaluating the time-based output, we find significantly improved responses of AFNNs compared to GFNNs to stimuli with both steady and varying pulse frequencies. This leads us to believe that AFNNs could replace the linear filtering methods commonly used in beat tracking and tempo estimation systems, and lead to more accurate methods.;"Andrew J.

Utilizing a subset of these transcriptions aligned to their associated audio sources, we propose a model based on supervised training of a Hidden Markov Model with ground-truth state sequences designed to encode melodic contours appearing frequently in jazz improvisations. Results indicate that representing likely melodic contours in this way allows a lowlevel audio feature set containing primarily timbral and harmonic information to more accurately predict phrase boundaries.;"Jeff Gregorio, Drexel University, USA, education;Youngmoo E.

A prerequisite of adopting a machine learning methodology is the availability of annotated corpora. However, different genres of music have different characteristics and modelling these characteristics is an important part of creating state of the art MIR systems. Consequently, although some music corpora are available the use of these corpora is tied to the speciﬁc music genre, instrument type and recording context the corpus covers. This paper introduces the ﬁrst corpus of annotations of audio recordings of Irish traditional dance music that covers multiple instrument types and both solo studio and live session recordings. We ﬁrst discuss the considerations that motivated our design choices in developing the corpus.

In this context, we benchmark three different weight sharing strategies for deep convolutional networks in the time-frequency domain: temporal kernels; time-frequency kernels; and a linear combination of time-frequency kernels which are one octave apart, akin to a Shepard pitch spiral. We provide an acoustical interpretation of these strategies within the source-ﬁlter framework of quasi-harmonic sounds with a ﬁxed spectral envelope, which are archetypal of musical notes.

Kruspe;Bootstrapping a System for Phoneme Recognition and Keyword Spotting in Unaccompanied Singing.;2016;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417553;Speech recognition in singing is still a largely unsolved problem. Acoustic models trained on speech usually produce unsatisfactory results when used for phoneme recognition in singing. On the ﬂipside, there is no phonetically annotated singing data set that could be used to train more accurate acoustic models for this task. In this paper, we attempt to solve this problem using the DAMP data set which contains a large number of recordings of amateur singing in good quality. We ﬁrst align them to the matching textual lyrics using an acoustic model trained on speech. We then use the resulting phoneme alignment to train new acoustic models using only subsets of the DAMP singing data. These models are then tested for phoneme recognition and, on top of that, keyword spotting. Evaluation is performed for different subsets of DAMP and for an unrelated set of the vocal tracks of commercial pop songs. Results are compared to those obtained with acoustic models trained on the TIMIT speech data set and on a version of TIMIT augmented for singing. Our new approach shows signiﬁcant improvements over both.;Anna M.

We focus on the identiﬁcation of 4 rudimentary techniques: strike, buzz roll, ﬂam, and drag. The speciﬁcs and the challenges of this task are being discussed, and different sets of features are compared, including various features extracted from NMF-based activation functions, as well as baseline spectral features.

To design and evaluate the system, two datasets are introduced: a training dataset generated from individual drum hits, and additional annotations of the well-known ENST drum dataset minus one subset as test dataset.

To document and organize this time, musicians commonly use practice charts to log their practice. However, manual techniques require time, dedication, and experience to master, are prone to fallacy and omission, and ultimately can not describe the subtle variations in each repetition. This paper presents an alternative: by analyzing and classifying the audio recorded while practicing, logging could occur automatically, with levels of detail, accuracy, and ease that would not be possible otherwise. Towards this goal, we introduce the problem of Automatic Practice Logging (APL), including a discussion of the benefits and unique challenges it raises. We then describe a new dataset of over 600 annotated recordings of solo piano practice, which can be used to design and evaluate APL systems.

Intabulating involved deciding what to omit from a score to fit the instrument, and making it fit under the hand. Notes were usually added as embellishments to the original plain score, using idiomatic patterns, typically at cadences, but often filling simple intervals in the vocal parts with faster notes. Here we test whether such patterns are both characteristic of lute intabulations as a class (vs original lute music) and of different genres within that class. We use patterns identified in the musicological literature to search two annotated corpora of encoded lute music using the SIA(M)ESE algorithm. Diatonic patterns occur in many chromatic forms, accidentals being added depending how the arranger applied the conventions of musica ficta. Rhythms must be applied at three different scales as notation is inconsistent across the repertory. This produced over 88,000 short melodic queries to search in two corpora totalling just over 6,000 encodings of lute pieces.

Uncovering this structure in a musically relevant form can provide for powerful visual representations of the concert audio that is of potential value in music appreciation and pedagogy. We investigate the structural analysis of the metered section (gat) of concerts of two plucked string instruments, the sitar and sarod. A prominent aspect of the gat is the interplay between the melody soloist and the accompanying drummer (tabla). The tempo as provided by the tabla together with the rhythmic density of the sitar/sarod plucks serve as the main dimensions that predict the transition between concert sections. We present methods to access the stream of tabla onsets separately from the sitar/sarod onsets, addressing challenges that arise in the instrument separation. Further, the robust detection of tempo and the estimation of rhythmic density of sitar/sarod plucks are discussed.

This particular structure allows new perspectives on well-known MIR tasks. In this paper we ﬁrst review a prototypical production technique for EM from which we derive a simpliﬁed model.

A common strategy is to proceed in a two-step fashion. First, a fundamental frequency (F0) trajectory for the musical voice that is likely to exhibit vibrato is estimated. In a second step, the trajectory is then analyzed with respect to periodic frequency modulations. As a major drawback, however, such a method cannot recover from errors made in the inherently difficult first step, which severely limits the performance during the second step. In this work, we present a novel vibrato analysis approach that avoids the first error-prone F0-estimation step. Our core idea is to perform the analysis directly on a signal’s spectrogram representation where vibrato is evident in the form of characteristic spectro-temporal patterns. We detect and parameterize these patterns by locally comparing the spectrogram with a predefined set of vibrato templates.

It is trained to compute chroma features that encode harmonic information important for chord recognition, while being robust to irrelevant interferences. We achieve this by feeding the network an audio spectrum with context instead of a single frame as input. This way, the network can learn to selectively compensate noise and resolve harmonic ambiguities.

A system is presented that simultaneously learns to read notes, listens to music and matches the currently played music to its corresponding notes in the sheet. It consists of an end-to-end multi-modal convolutional neural network that takes as input images of sheet music and spectrograms of the respective audio snippets. It learns to predict, for a given unseen audio snippet (covering approximately one bar of music), the corresponding position in the respective score line.

Transcribing the drum tracks of music pieces is a well-deﬁned sub-task. The symbolic representation of a drum track contains much useful information about the piece, like meter, tempo, as well as various style and genre cues. This work introduces a novel approach for drum transcription using recurrent neural networks. We claim that recurrent neural networks can be trained to identify the onsets of percussive instruments based on general properties of their sound. Different architectures of recurrent neural networks are compared and evaluated using a well-known dataset. The outcomes are compared to results of a state-of-the-art approach on the same dataset. Furthermore, the ability of the networks to generalize is demonstrated using a second, independent dataset. The experiments yield promising results: while F-measures higher than state-of-the-art results are achieved, the networks are capable of generalizing reasonably well.;"Richard Vogl, Johannes Kepler University Linz, AUT, education;Matthias Dorfer, Johannes Kepler University Linz, AUT, education;Peter Knees, Johannes Kepler University Linz, AUT, education";Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University;education, education, education;AUT, AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;54.847122;-30.945736

A basic assumption of the system is that humans understand rhythm by letting salient periodicities in the music act as a framework, upon which the rhythmical structure is interpreted. Therefore, the system estimates the cepstroid (the most salient periodicity of the music), and uses a neural network that is invariant with regards to the cepstroid length. The input of the network consists mainly of features that capture onset characteristics along time, such as spectral differences. The invariant properties of the network are achieved by subsampling the input vectors with a hop size derived from a musically relevant subdivision of the computed cepstroid of each song. The output is filtered to detect relevant periodicities and then used in conjunction with two additional networks, which estimates the speed and tempo of the music, to predict the final beat positions. We show that the architecture has a high performance on music with public annotations.;Anders Elowsson, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SWE, education;KTH Royal Institute of Technology;education;SWE;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;58.01534;5.7922273

Since considerable effort has been devoted to estimate the frame-level F0s of singing voices from music audio signals, we tackle musical note estimation for those F0s to obtain a symbolic musical score. A na¨ıve approach to musical note estimation is to quantize the vocal F0s at a semitone level in every time unit (e.g., half beat). This approach, however, fails when the vocal F0s are signiﬁcantly deviated from those speciﬁed by a musical score. The onsets of musical notes are often delayed or advanced from beat times and the vocal F0s ﬂuctuate according to singing expressions. To deal with these deviations, we propose a Bayesian hidden Markov model that allows musical notes to change in semi-synchronization with beat times. Both the semitone-level F0s and onset deviations of musical notes are regarded as latent variables and the frequency deviations are modeled by an emission distribution. The musical notes and their onset and frequency deviations are jointly estimated by using Gibbs sampling. Experimental results showed that the proposed method improved the accuracy of musical note estimation against baseline methods.;"Ryo Nishikimi, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Eita Nakamura, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Katsutoshi Itoyama, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Kazuyoshi Yoshii, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education";Kyoto University, Kyoto University, Kyoto University,Kyoto University;education, education, education, education;JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;26.867517;-5.7618704

A popular approach to multipitch analysis is to perform nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for estimating the temporal activations of semitone-level pitches and then execute thresholding for making a piano-roll representation. The major problems of this cascading approach are that an optimal threshold is hard to determine for each musical piece and that musically inappropriate pitch combinations are allowed to appear. To solve these problems, we propose a probabilistic generative model that fuses an acoustic model (NMF) for a music spectrogram with a language model (hidden Markov model; HMM) for pitch locations in a hierarchical Bayesian manner. More specifically, binary variables indicating the existences of pitches are introduced into the framework of NMF. The latent grammatical structures of those variables are regulated by an HMM that encodes chord progressions and pitch co-occurrences (chord components).

Processing the pitch values extracted from raw input audio signal may be computationally complex as it requires substantial effort to reduce the uncertainty resulting i.a. from tempo variability and transpositions. A typical example is the melody matching problem in Query-by-Humming (QbH) systems, where Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and note-based approaches are typically applied. In this work we present a new, simple and efficient method of investigating the melody content which may be used for approximate, preliminary matching of melodies irrespective of their tempo and length. The proposed solution is based on Discrete Total Variation (DTV) of the melody pitch vector, which may be computed in linear time. We demonstrate its practical application for finding the appropriate melody cutting points in the R∗-tree-based DTW indexing framework. The experimental validation is based on a dataset of 4431 queries and over 4000 template melodies, constructed specially for testing Query-by-Humming systems.;Bartłomiej Stasiak, Lodz University of Technology, POL, education;Lodz University of Technology;education;POL;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-17.763649;-19.3053

In this paper we use the symbolic encoding of Frances Densmore’s collection of over 2000 songs, digitized between 1998 and 2014, to examine the relationship between internal musical features and social function. More specifically, this paper applies contrast data mining to discover global feature patterns that describe generalized social functions. Extracted patterns are discussed with reference to early ethnomusicological work and recent approaches to music, emotion, and ethology.

Since many aspects of structural annotations are highly regular, but few of these regularities are taken into account by current algorithms, we propose several methods of improving predictions of musical structure by using their likelihood according to prior distributions. We test the use of priors to improve a committee of basic segmentation algorithms, and to improve a committee of cutting-edge approaches submitted to MIREX. In both cases, we are unable to improve on the best committee member, meaning that our proposed approach is outperformed by simple parameter tuning. The same negative result was found despite incorporating the priors in multiple ways. To explain the result, we show that although there is a correlation overall between output accuracy and prior likelihood, the weakness of the correlation in the high-likelihood region makes the proposed method infeasible.

While musical similarity compares just two songs, musical typicality quantifies how many of the songs in a set are similar. It can be used not only to express the uniqueness of a song but also to recommend one that is representative of a set. Building on the type theory in information theory (Cover & Thomas 2006), we use a Bayesian generative model of musical features and compute the typicality of a song as the sum of the probabilities of the songs that share the type of the given song. To evaluate estimated results, we focused on vocal timbre which can be evaluated quantitatively by using the singer’s gender. Estimated typicality is evaluated against the Pearson correlation coefficient between the computed typicality and the ratio of the number of male singers to female singers of a song-set.

In this paper, we present an approach that discovers user behavior from a large-scale, real-world listening record. The proposed approach generates a latent representation of users, listening sessions, and songs, where each of these objects is represented as a point in the multi-dimensional latent space. Since the distance between two points is an indication of the similarity of the two corresponding objects, it becomes extremely simple to evaluate the similarity between songs or the matching of songs with the user preference. By exploiting this feature, we provide a two-dimensional user behavior analysis framework for music recommendation. Exploring the relationships between user preference and the contextual or temporal information in the session data through this framework significantly facilitates personalized music recommendation.

While MIREX has managed to successfully maintain operations for over a decade, its long-term sustainability is at risk. The imposed constraint that input data cannot be made freely available to participants necessitates that all algorithms run on centralized computational resources, which are administered by a limited number of people. This incurs an approximately linear cost with the number of submissions, exacting significant tolls on both human and financial resources, such that the current paradigm becomes less tenable as participation increases. To alleviate the recurring costs of future evaluation campaigns, we propose a distributed, community-centric paradigm for system evaluation, built upon the principles of openness, transparency, reproducibility, and incremental evaluation.

We propose to discover and leverage the layering structure and use it for both structural segmentation and source separation. We use reconstruction error from non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to guide structure discovery. Reconstruction error spikes at moments of significant sonic change. This guides segmentation and also lets us group basis sets for NMF. The number of sources, the types of sources, and when the sources are active are not known in advance. The only information is a specific type of layering structure. There is no separate training phase to learn a good basis set. No prior seeding of the NMF matrices is required. Unlike standard approaches to NMF there is no need for a post-processor to partition the learned basis functions by group. Source groups are learned automatically from the data. We evaluate our method on mixtures consisting of looping source groups. This separation approach outperforms a standard clustering NMF source separation approach on such mixtures.

The automatic separation of music into voices is complicated by the fact that music spans a voice-leading continuum ranging from monophonic, to homophonic, to polyphonic, often within the same work. We address this diversity by deﬁning voice separation as the task of partitioning music into streams that exhibit both a high degree of external perceptual separation from the other streams and a high degree of internal perceptual consistency, to the maximum degree that is possible in the given musical input. Equipped with this task deﬁnition, we manually annotated a corpus of popular music and used it to train a neural network with one hidden layer that is connected to a diverse set of perceptually informed input features. The trained neural model greedily assigns notes to voices in a left to right traversal of the input chord sequence.

Our approach involves the use of a kernel expansion of the ANEW dataset to exploit a higher number of dimensions, and the application of distance learning techniques to find a distance metric that is consistent with the semantic similarity among terms. In order to train the distance learning algorithms, we collect information on the semantic similarity from human annotation and editorial tags.

"Daniel Stoller;Simon Dixon";Analysis and Classification of Phonation Modes In Singing.;2016;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416772;Phonation mode is an expressive aspect of the singing voice and can be described using the four categories neutral, breathy, pressed and ﬂow. Previous attempts at automatically classifying the phonation mode on a dataset containing vowels sung by a female professional have been lacking in accuracy or have not sufﬁciently investigated the characteristic features of the different phonation modes which enable successful classiﬁcation. In this paper, we extract a large range of features from this dataset, including specialised descriptors of pressedness and breathiness, to analyse their explanatory power and robustness against changes of pitch and vowel. We train and optimise a feed-forward neural network (NN) with one hidden layer on all features using cross validation to achieve a mean F-measure above 0.85 and an improved performance compared to previous work. Applying feature selection based on mutual information and retaining the nine highest ranked features as input to a NN results in a mean F-measure of 0.78, demonstrating the suitability of these features to discriminate between phonation modes.

"Mi Tian;Mark B. Sandler";Music Structural Segmentation Across Genres with Gammatone Features.;2016;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417713;Music structural segmentation (MSS) studies to date mainly employ audio features describing the timbral, harmonic or rhythmic aspects of the music and are evaluated using datasets consisting primarily of Western music. A new dataset of Chinese traditional Jingju music with structural annotations is introduced in this paper to complement the existing evaluation framework. We discuss some statistics of the annotations analysing the inter-annotator agreements. We present two auditory features derived from the Gammatone filters based respectively on the cepstral analysis and the spectral contrast description. The Gammatone features and two commonly used features, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and chromagram, are evaluated on the Jingju dataset as well as two existing used ones using several state-of-the-art algorithms. The investigated Gammatone features outperform MFCCs and chromagram when evaluated on the Jingju dataset and show similar performance with the Western datasets. We identify the presented Gammatone features as effective structure descriptors, especially for music lacking notable timbral or harmonic sectional variations. Results also indicate that the design of audio features and segmentation algorithms should be adapted to specific music genres to interpret individual structural patterns.;"Mi Tian, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Mark B.

"Thomas Hedges;Geraint A. Wiggins";Improving Predictions of Derived Viewpoints in Multiple Viewpoints Systems.;2016;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416630;This paper presents and tests a method for improving the predictive power of derived viewpoints in multiple viewpoints systems. Multiple viewpoint systems are a well established method for the statistical modelling of sequential symbolic musical data. A useful class of viewpoints known as derived viewpoints map symbols from a basic event space to a viewpoint-specific domain. Probability estimates are calculated in the derived viewpoint domain before an inverse function maps back to the basic event space to complete the model. Since an element in the derived viewpoint domain can potentially map onto multiple basic elements, probability mass is distributed between the basic elements with a uniform distribution. As an alternative, this paper proposes a distribution weighted by zero-order frequencies of the basic elements to inform this probability mapping. Results show this improves the predictive performance for certain derived viewpoints, allowing them to be selected in viewpoint selection.;"Thomas Hedges, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Geraint Wiggins, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education";Queen Mary University of London, Queen Mary University of London;education, education;GBR, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;20.35652;13.607281

To automatically detect these mistakes, a first idea is to use a music transcription method to detect notes played in an audio recording and to compare the results with a corresponding score. However, as the number of transcription errors produced by standard methods is often considerably higher than the number of actual mistakes, the results are often of limited use. In contrast, our method exploits that the score already provides rough information about what we seek to detect in the audio, which allows us to construct a tailored transcription method. In particular, we employ score-informed source separation techniques to learn for each score pitch a set of templates capturing the spectral properties of that pitch. After extrapolating the resulting template dictionary to pitches not in the score, we estimate the activity of each MIDI pitch over time. Finally, making again use of the score, we choose for each pitch an individualized threshold to differentiate note onsets from spurious activity in an optimized way. We indicate the accuracy of our approach on a dataset of piano pieces commonly used in education.;"Sebastian Ewert, Centre for Digital Music (C4DM), Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Siying Wang, Centre for Digital Music (C4DM), Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Meinard Müller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, facility;Mark Sandler, Centre for Digital Music (C4DM), Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education";Queen Mary University of London, Queen Mary University of London, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Queen Mary University of London;education, education, facility, education;GBR, GBR, DEU, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-3.8088603;-40.29374

Their different conceptual organisation of features and output formats however present difficulties in exchanging or comparing data, while very limited means are provided to link features with content and provenance. These issues are hindering research reproducibility and the use of multiple tools in combination. We propose novel Semantic Web ontologies (1) to provide a common structure for feature data formats and (2) to represent computational workflows of audio features facilitating their comparison. The Audio Feature Ontology provides a descriptive framework for expressing different conceptualisations of and designing linked data formats for content-based audio features. To accommodate different views in organising features, the ontology does not impose a strict hierarchical structure, leaving this open to task and tool specific ontologies that derive from a common vocabulary. The ontologies are based on the analysis of existing feature extraction tools and the MIR literature, which was instrumental in guiding the design process. They are harmonised into a library of modular interlinked ontologies that describe the different entities and activities involved in music creation, production and consumption.;"Alo Allik, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;György Fazekas, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Mark Sandler, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education";Queen Mary University of London, Queen Mary University of London, Queen Mary University of London;education, education, education;GBR, GBR, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-49.80791;3.6162374

A group of 43 selected singers was asked to vocally imitate a set of stimuli. Five stimulus types were used: a constant pitch (stable), a constant pitch preceded by a pitch glide (head), a constant pitch followed by a pitch glide (tail), a pitch ramp and a pitch with vibrato; with parameters for main pitch, transient length and pitch difference. Two conditions were tested: singing simultaneously with the stimulus, and singing alternately, between repetitions of the stimulus. After automatic pitch-tracking and manual checking of the data, we calculated intonation accuracy and precision, and modelled the note trajectories according to the stimulus types. We modelled pitch error with a linear mixed-effects model, and tested factors for significant effects using one-way analysis of variance. The results indicate: (1) Significant factors include stimulus type, main pitch, repetition, condition and musical training background, while order of stimuli, gender and age do not have any significant effect. (2) The ramp, vibrato and tail stimuli have significantly greater absolute pitch errors than the stable and head stimuli. (3) Pitch error shows a small but significant linear trend with pitch difference.

In this study we focus on the evaluation of audio features that can be used for rhythmic and melodic content description and similarity estimation. We select a set of state-of-the-art rhythmic and melodic descriptors and assess their invariance with respect to transformations of timbre, recording quality, tempo and pitch. We create a dataset of synthesised audio and investigate which features are invariant to the aforementioned transformations and whether invariance is affected by characteristics of the music style and the monophonic or polyphonic character of the audio recording. From the descriptors tested, the scale transform performed best for rhythm classification and retrieval and pitch bihistogram performed best for melody. The proposed evaluation strategy can inform decisions in the feature design process leading to significant improvement in the reliability of the features.;"Maria Panteli, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London, United Kingdom, education;Simon Dixon, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London, United Kingdom, education";Queen Mary University of London,Queen Mary University of London;education, education;GBR, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-13.845623;-1.6581135

We use state-of-the-art audio features to describe musical content in world music recordings. Our music collection is a subset of the Smithsonian Folkways Recordings with audio examples from 31 countries from around the world. Using supervised and unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques we learn feature representations for music similarity. We evaluate how well music styles separate in this learned space with a classification experiment. We obtained moderate performance classifying the recordings by country. Analysis of misclassifications revealed cases of geographical or cultural proximity. We further evaluate the learned space by detecting outliers, i.e. identifying recordings that stand out in the collection. We use a data mining technique based on Mahalanobis distances to detect outliers and perform a listening experiment in the ‘odd one out’ style to evaluate our findings.

Many of these algorithms, however, are based on techniques that rely on a series of local decisions to construct a complete music analysis, resulting in analyses that are not guaranteed to resemble ground-truth analyses in their large-scale organizational shapes or structures. In this paper, we examine a number of hierarchical music analysis data sets — drawing from Schenkerian analysis and other analytical systems based on A Generative Theory of Tonal Music — to study three global properties calculated from the shapes of the analyses. The major finding presented in this work is that it is possible for an algorithm that only makes local decisions to produce analyses that resemble expert analyses with regards to the three global properties in question. We also illustrate specific similarities and differences in these properties across both ground-truth and algorithmically-produced analyses.;Phillip B.

Analyzing recent results for various tasks of MIREX (MIR Evaluation eXchange), we observed that the evolution of task solutions follows two different patterns: for some tasks, the results apparently hit stagnation, whereas for others, they seem getting better over time. In this paper, (a) we compile the MIREX results of the last 6 years, (b) we propose a configurable quantitative index for evolution trend measurement of MIREX tasks, and (c) we discuss possible explanations or hypotheses for the stagnation phenomena hitting some of them.

Source-ﬁlter models are used to create a mid-level representation of pitch that implicitly incorporates timbre information. The spectrogram of a musical audio signal is modelled as the sum of the leading voice (produced by human voice or pitched musical instruments) and accompaniment. The leading voice is then modelled with a Smoothed Instantaneous Mixture Model (SIMM) based on a source-ﬁlter model. The main advantage of such a pitch salience function is that it enhances the leading voice even without explicitly separating it from the rest of the signal. We show that this is beneﬁcial for melody extraction, increasing pitch estimation accuracy and reducing octave errors in comparison with simpler pitch salience functions. The adequate combination with voicing detection techniques based on pitch contour characterisation leads to signiﬁcant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, for both vocal and instrumental music.;"Juan J.

It is a core concept used in composition, performance, organization, and pedagogy. Automatic r¯aga recognition is thus a fundamental information retrieval task in Indian art music. In this paper, we propose the time-delayed melody surface (TDMS), a novel feature based on delay coordinates that captures the melodic outline of a r¯aga. A TDMS describes both the tonal and the temporal characteristics of a melody, using only an estimation of the predominant pitch. Considering a simple k-nearest neighbor classiﬁer, TDMSs outperform the state-of-the-art for r¯aga recognition by a large margin. We obtain 98% accuracy on a Hindustani music dataset of 300 recordings and 30 r¯agas, and 87% accuracy on a Carnatic music dataset of 480 recordings and 40 r¯agas. TDMSs are simple to implement, fast to compute, and have a musically meaningful interpretation. Since the concepts and formulation behind the TDMS are generic and widely applicable, we envision its usage in other music traditions beyond Indian art music.;"Sankalp Gulati, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Joan Serr`a, Telefonica Research, ESP, company;Kaustuv K Ganguli, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education;Sertan S¸ent¨urk, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Xavier Serra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Telefonica Research, IIT Bombay, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, company, education, education, education;ESP, ESP, IND, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developing economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;31.167072;25.355501
"Frederic Font;Xavier Serra";Tempo Estimation for Music Loops and a Simple Confidence Measure.;2016;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1417659;Tempo estimation is a common task within the music information retrieval community, but existing works are rarely evaluated with datasets of music loops and the algorithms are not tailored to this particular type of content. In addition to this, existing works on tempo estimation do not put an emphasis on providing a conﬁdence value that indicates how reliable their tempo estimations are. In current music creation contexts, it is common for users to search for and use loops shared in online repositories. These loops are typically not produced by professionals and lack annotations. Hence, the existence of reliable tempo estimation algorithms becomes necessary to enhance the reusability of loops shared in such repositories. In this paper, we test six existing tempo estimation algorithms against four music loop datasets containing more than 35k loops. We also propose a simple and computationally cheap conﬁdence measure that can be applied to any existing algorithm to estimate the reliability of their tempo predictions when applied to music loops. We analyse the accuracy of the algorithms in combination with our proposed conﬁdence measure, and see that we can signiﬁcantly improve the algorithms’ performance when only considering music loops with high estimated conﬁdence.;"Frederic Font, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Xavier Serra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education;ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;50.002068;17.48949

Goodness is considered here as the common agreed basic sound quality of an instrument without taking into consideration musical expressiveness. Musicians upload their sounds and vote on existing sounds, and from the collected data the system is able to develop sound goodness measures of relevance for music education applications. The core of the system is a database of sounds, together with audio features extracted from them using MTG’s Essentia library and user annotations related to the goodness of the sounds. The web frontend provides useful data visualizations of the sound attributes and tools to facilitate user interaction. To evaluate the framework, we carried out an experiment to rate sound goodness of single notes of nine orchestral instruments. In it, users rated the sounds using an AB vote over a set of sound attributes defined to be of relevance in the characterization of single notes of instrumental sounds. With the obtained votes we built a ranking of the sounds for each attribute and developed a model that rates the goodness for each of the selected sound attributes.

It has been studied in a classical context where timing and dynamic deviations are modeled using machine learning techniques. In jazz music, work has been done previously on the study of ornament prediction in guitar performance, as well as in saxophone expressive modeling. However, little work has been done on expressive ensemble performance. In this work, we analysed the musical expressivity of jazz guitar and piano from two different perspectives: solo and ensemble performance. The aim of this paper is to study the influence of piano accompaniment into the performance of a guitar melody and vice versa. Based on a set of recordings made by professional musicians, we extracted descriptors from the score, we transcribed the guitar and the piano performances and calculated performance actions for both instruments. We applied machine learning techniques to train models for each performance action, taking into account both solo and ensemble descriptors. Finally, we compared the accuracy of the induced models. The accuracy of most models increased when ensemble information was considered, which can be explained by the interaction between musicians.;"Bantula, Helena, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Giraldo, Sergio, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Ramirez, Rafael, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education, education;ESP, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-23.006788;-19.918953

In this work we extend a state of the art approach for lyrics-to-audio alignment with information about note onsets. In particular, we consider the fact that transition to next lyrics syllable usually implies transition to a new musical note. To this end we formulate rules that guide the transition between consecutive phonemes when a note onset is present. These rules are incorporated into the transition matrix of a variable-time hidden Markov model (VTHMM) phonetic recognizer based on MFCCs. An estimated melodic contour is input to an automatic note transcription algorithm, from which the note onsets are derived. The proposed approach is evaluated on 12 a cappella audio recordings of Turkish Makam music using a phrase-level accuracy measure. Evaluation of the alignment is also presented on a polyphonic version of the dataset in order to assess how degradation in the extracted onsets affects performance. Results show that the proposed model outperforms a baseline approach unaware of onset transition rules.

One of the best ways to compute this separation, as proposed by Chew and Wu in 2005 [2], is to first identify contigs that are portions of the music score with a constant number of voices, then to progressively connect these contigs. This raises two questions: Which contigs should be connected first? And, how should these two contigs be connected? Here we propose to answer simultaneously these two questions by considering a set of musical features that measures the quality of any connection. The coefficients weighting the features are optimized through a genetic algorithm. We benchmark the resulting connection policy on corpora containing fugues of the Well-Tempered Clavier by J. S. Bach as well as on string quartets, and we compare it against previously proposed policies [2, 9].

Assuming that current technologies cannot guarantee a perfect automatic transcription, our intention is to develop an interactive system in which user and software collaborate to complete the task. Since conventional score post-editing might be tedious, the user is allowed to interact using an electronic pen. Although this provides a more ergonomic interface, this interaction must be decoded as well. In our framework, the user traces the symbols using the electronic pen over a digital surface, which provides both the underlying image (ofﬂine data) and the drawing made by the e-pen (online data) to improve classiﬁcation. Applying this methodology over 70 scores of the target musical archive, a dataset of 10 230 bimodal samples of 30 different symbols was obtained and made available for research purposes.

While most authors make exclusively use of chroma features, recent work tends to demonstrate that combining similarity estimators based on multiple audio features increases the performance. We improve this approach by using a hierarchical rank aggregation method for combining estimators based on different features. More precisely, we first aggregate estimators based on global features such as the tempo, the duration, the overall loudness, the number of beats, and the average chroma vector. Then, we aggregate the resulting composite estimator with four popular state-of-the-art methods based on chromas as well as timbre sequences.

"Andrea Cogliati;David Temperley;Zhiyao Duan";Transcribing Human Piano Performances into Music Notation.;2016;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416466;Automatic music transcription aims to transcribe musical performances into music notation. However, existing transcription systems that have been described in research papers typically focus on multi-F0 estimation from audio and only output notes in absolute terms, showing frequency and absolute time (a piano-roll representation), but not in musical terms, with spelling distinctions (e.g., A♭ versus G♯) and quantized meter. To complete the transcription process, one would need to convert the piano-roll representation into a properly formatted and musically meaningful musical score. This process is non-trivial and largely unresearched. In this paper we present a system that generates music notation output from human-recorded MIDI performances of piano music. We show that the correct estimation of the meter, harmony and streams in a piano performance provides a solid foundation to produce a properly formatted score. In a blind evaluation by professional music theorists, the proposed method outperforms two commercial programs and an open source program in terms of pitch notation and rhythmic notation, and ties for the top in terms of overall voicing and staff placement.;"Andrea Cogliati, University of Rochester, USA, education;David Temperley, Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester, USA, education;Zhiyao Duan, University of Rochester, USA, education";University of Rochester, University of Rochester, University of Rochester;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;3.915538;-39.851162

To this end, we apply a stochastic sequential model of simple decisions, the drift-diffusion model (DDM), to understand risky decision behavior. Numerous studies have demonstrated that mood can affect emotional and cognitive processing, but the exact nature of the impact music has on decision making in quantitative tasks has not been sufﬁciently studied. In our experiment, participants decided whether to accept or reject multiple bets with different risk vs. reward ratios while listening to music that was chosen to induce positive or negative mood. Our results indicate that music indeed alters people’s behavior in a surprising way happy music made people make better choices. In other words, it made people more likely to accept good bets and reject bad bets. The DDM decomposition indicated the effect focused primarily on both the caution and the information processing aspects of decision making. To further understand the correspondence between auditory features and decision making, we studied how individual aspects of music affect response patterns. Our results are particularly interesting when compared with recent results regarding the impact of music on emotional processing, as they illustrate that music affects analytical decision making in a fundamentally different way, hinting at a different psychological mechanism that music impacts.;"Elad Liebman, The University of Texas at Austin, USA, education;Peter Stone, The University of Texas at Austin, USA, education;Corey N.

We propose MusicDB, a new approach for longitudinal music analytics that adapts techniques from relational databases to the music setting. By representing song timeseries data relationally, we aim to dramatically decrease the programming effort required for complex analytics while significantly improving scalability. We show how our platform can improve performance by reducing the amount of data accessed for many common analytics tasks, and how such tasks can be implemented quickly in relational languages — variants of SQL. We further show that expressing music analytics tasks over relational representations allows the system to automatically parallelize and optimize the resulting programs to improve performance. We evaluate our system by expressing complex analytics tasks including calculating song density and beat-aligning features and showing significant performance improvements over previous results.

Ryan Groves;Automatic Melodic Reduction Using a Supervised Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar.;2016;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416924;This research explores a Natural Language Processing technique utilized for the automatic reduction of melodies: the Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG). Automatic melodic reduction was previously explored by means of a probabilistic grammar [11] [1]. However, each of these methods used unsupervised learning to estimate the probabilities for the grammar rules, and thus a corpus-based evaluation was not performed. A dataset of analyses using the Generative Theory of Tonal Music (GTTM) exists [13], which contains 300 Western tonal melodies and their corresponding melodic reductions in tree format. In this work, supervised learning is used to train a PCFG for the task of melodic reduction, using the tree analyses provided by the GTTM dataset. The resulting model is evaluated on its ability to create accurate reduction trees, based on a node-by-node comparison with ground-truth trees. Multiple data representations are explored, and example output reductions are shown. Motivations for performing melodic reduction include melodic identification and similarity, efficient storage of melodies, automatic composition, variation matching, and automatic harmonic analysis.;Ryan Groves,;unknown;unknown;unknown;FOUND;;;-14.899479;-22.246738

However, the recent WaveNet model proposed by DeepMind shows that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can also generate realistic musical waveforms in the audio domain. Following this light, we investigate using CNNs for generating melody (a series of MIDI notes) one bar after another in the symbolic domain. In addition to the generator, we use a discriminator to learn the distributions of melodies, making it a generative adversarial network (GAN). Moreover, we propose a novel conditional mechanism to exploit available prior knowledge, so that the model can generate melodies either from scratch, by following a chord sequence, or by conditioning on the melody of previous bars (e.g. a priming melody), among other possibilities. The resulting model, named MidiNet, can be expanded to generate music with multiple MIDI channels (i.e. tracks). We conduct a user study to compare the melody of eight-bar long generated by MidiNet and by Google’s MelodyRNN models, each time using the same priming melody.

Of the few studies that model the acquisition of perceptual learning from musical data, most have employed self-organizing models that learn a topology of static descriptions of musical contexts.

For example, used as a way to represent expressive timing, tempo curves can be regressed by a polynomial function such that the number of regressed polynomial coefficients remains constant with a given order regardless of phrase lengths. In this paper, clustering the regressed polynomial coefficients is proposed for expressive timing analysis. A model selection test is presented to compare Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) fitting regressed polynomial coefficients and fitting expressive timing directly. As there are no expected results of clustering expressive timing, the proposed method is demonstrated by how well the expressive timing are approximated by the centroids of GMMs. The results show that GMMs fitting the regressed polynomial coefficients outperform GMMs fitting expressive timing directly. This conclusion suggests that it is possible to use regressed polynomial coefficients to represent expressive timing within a phrase and cluster expressive timing within phrases of different lengths.;"Shengchen Li, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, CHN, education;Simon Dixon, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Mark D.

To date, recurrent neural network (RNN) systems have achieved the highest evaluation accuracies for both drum solo and polyphonic recordings, however the accuracies within a polyphonic context still remain relatively low. To improve accuracy for polyphonic recordings, we present two approaches to the ADT problem: First, to capture the dynamism of features in multiple time-step hidden layers, we propose the use of soft attention mechanisms (SA) and an alternative RNN configuration containing additional peripheral connections (PC). Second, to capture these same trends at the input level, we propose the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which uses a larger set of time-step features. In addition, we propose the use of a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) in the peak-picking stage.

Since MFCC and HPCP capture complementary information, we design an unsupervised algorithm that combines normalized, beat-synchronous blocks of these features using cross-similarity fusion before attempting to locally align a pair of songs. As an added bonus, our scheme naturally incorporates structural information in each song to ﬁll in alignment gaps where both feature sets fail. We show a striking jump in performance over MFCC and HPCP alone, achieving a state of the art mean reciprocal rank of 0.87 on the Covers80 dataset. We also introduce a new medium-sized hand designed benchmark dataset called “Covers 1000,” which consists of 395 cliques of cover songs for a total of 1000 songs, and we show that our algorithm achieves an MRR of 0.9 on this dataset for the ﬁrst correctly identiﬁed song in a clique. We provide the precomputed HPCP and MFCC features, as well as beat intervals, for all songs in the Covers 1000 dataset for use in further research.;Christopher J.

In this paper, multichannel CNNs with different architectures and LSTM are combined into one uniﬁed architecture (Multi-Channel Convolutional LSTM, MCCLSTM) to extract high-level music descriptors. First, three channels of CNNs with different shapes of ﬁlter are applied on each spectrogram image chunk to extract the pitch-, tempo-, and bassrelevant descriptors, respectively. Then, the outputs of each CNNs channel are concatenated and then passed through a fully connected layer to obtain the fused descriptor. Finally, LSTM is applied on the fused descriptor sequence of the whole track to extract its long-term structure property to obtain the high-level descriptor. To prove the efﬁciency of the MCCLSTM model, the obtained high-level music descriptor is applied to the music genre classiﬁcation and emotion prediction task. Experimental results demonstrate that, when compared with the hand-crafted schemes or conventional deep learning (Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP), CNNs, and LSTM) based ones, MCCLSTM achieves higher prediction accuracy on three music collections with different kinds of semantic tags.;"Ning Chen, East China University of Science and Technology, CHN, education;Shijun Wang, East China University of Science and Technology, CHN, education";East China University of Science and Technology, East China University of Science and Technology;education, education;CHN, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;9.507501;21.042072

A second processing step, called note segmentation, has to be performed for each pitch in order to identify the time intervals when the notes are played. In this study, a pitch-wise two-state on/off ﬁrst-order Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is developed for note segmentation. A complete parametrization of the HMM sigmoid function is proposed, based on its original regression formulation, including a parameter α of slope smoothing and β of thresholding contrast. A comparative evaluation of different note segmentation strategies was performed, differentiated according to whether they use a ﬁxed threshold, called “Hard Thresholding” (HT), or a HMM-based thresholding method, called “Soft Thresholding” (ST). This evaluation was done following MIREX standards and using the MAPS dataset. Also, different transcription and recording scenarios were tested using three units of the Audio Degradation toolbox. Results show that note segmentation through a HMM soft thresholding with a data-based optimization of the {α, β} parameter couple signiﬁcantly enhances transcription performance.;"Dorian Cazau, Lab-STICC, ENSTA-Bretagne, FRA, education;Yuancheng Wang, School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast China, CHN, education;Olivier Adam, Institut d’Alembert, UPMC, FRA, education;Qiao Wang, School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast China, CHN, education;Gr´egory Nuel, LPMA, UPMC, FRA, education";ENSTA-Bretagne, Southeast China University, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Southeast China University, Université Pierre et Marie Curie;education, education, education, education, education;FRA, CHN, FRA, CHN, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developing economies, Developed economies, Developing economies, Developed economies;5.770147;-35.64513

Although effective, this approach may lead to recommendations that are relevant but obvious and uninteresting. Many approaches investigate this problem by trying to avoid recommendation lists in which items are very similar to each other (aka diversiﬁcation) with respect to some aspect of the item. However, users may have very different preferences concerning what aspects should be diversiﬁed and what should match their past/current preferences. In this paper we take this into consideration by proposing a solution based on multiobjective optimization for generating recommendation lists featuring the optimal balance between the aspects that should be held ﬁxed (maximize similarity with users actual items) and the ones that should be diversiﬁed (minimize similarity with other items in the recommendation list).

"Chih-Wei Wu;Alexander Lerch";Automatic Drum Transcription Using the Student-Teacher Learning Paradigm with Unlabeled Music Data.;2017;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415904;Automatic drum transcription is a sub-task of automatic music transcription that converts drum-related audio events into musical notation. While noticeable progress has been made in the past by combining pattern recognition methods with audio signal processing techniques, the major limitation of many state-of-the-art systems still originates from the difficulty of obtaining a meaningful amount of annotated data to support the data-driven algorithms. In this work, we address the challenge of insufficiently labeled data by exploring the possibility of utilizing unlabeled music data from online resources. Specifically, a student neural network is trained using the labels generated from multiple teacher systems. The performance of the model is evaluated on a publicly available dataset.

Unlike previous work in real-time accompaniment, we focus on generating the accompaniment track in an off-line fashion by adapting a full-mix recording (e.g. a professional CD recording or Youtube video) to match the user’s tempo preferences. The input to the system is a set of recorded passages of a solo part played by the user (e.g. solo part in a violin concerto). These recordings are contiguous segments of music where the soloist part is active. Based on this input, the system identifies the corresponding passages within a full-mix recording of the same piece (i.e. contains both solo and accompaniment parts), and these passages are temporally warped to run synchronously to the solo-only recordings. The warped passages can serve as accompaniment tracks for the user to play along with at a tempo that matches his or her ability or desired interpretation. As the main technical contribution, we introduce a segmental dynamic time warping algorithm that simultaneously solves both the passage identification and alignment problems.

Quantifying raga similarity becomes extremely challenging as it demands assimilation of both intrinsic (viz., notes, tempo) and extrinsic (viz., raga singing-time, emotions conveyed) properties of ragas. This paper introduces novel frameworks for quantifying similarities between ragas based on their melodic attributes alone, available in the form of bandish (composition) notation. Based on the hypothesis that notes in a particular raga are characterized by the company they keep, we design and train several deep recursive neural network variants with Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) units to learn distributed representations of notes in ragas from bandish notations. We refer to these distributed representations as note-embeddings. Note-embeddings, as we observe, capture a raga’s identity, and thus the similarity between note-embeddings signifies the similarity between the ragas. Evaluations with perplexity measure and clustering based method show the performance improvement in identifying similarities using note-embeddings over n-gram and unidirectional LSTM baselines. While our metric may not capture similarity between ragas in their entirety, it could be quite useful in various computational music settings that heavily rely on melodic information.;"Joe Cheri Ross, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education;Abhijit Mishra, IBM Research India, IND, company;Kaustuv Kanti Ganguli, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education;Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education;Preeti Rao, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education";IIT Bombay, IBM Research India, IIT Bombay, IIT Bombay, IIT Bombay;education, company, education, education, education;IND, IND, IND, IND, IND;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;29.604908;23.449408

It is therefore of much interest in pedagogy to understand what ungrammaticality might mean in the context of a given raga, and possibly develop means to detect this in an audio recording of the raga performance. One prominent notion is that ungrammaticality is considered to occur only when the performer “treads” on another, possibly allied, raga in a listener’s perception. With this view, we consider modeling the technical boundary of a raga as that which separates it from another raga that is closest to it in its distinctive features. We wish to ﬁnd computational models that can indicate ungrammaticality using a data-driven estimation of the model parameters; i.e. the raga performances of great artists are used to obtain representations that discriminate most between same and different raga performances.

Early lessons typically target the mastering of individual strokes from the inventory of bols (spoken syllables corresponding to the distinct strokes) via training in the required articulatory gestures on the right and left drums. Exploiting the close links between the articulation, acoustics and perception of tabla strokes, this paper presents a study of the different timbral qualities that correspond to the correct articulation and to identified common misarticulations of the different bols. We present a dataset created out of correctly articulated and distinct categories of misarticulated strokes, all perceptually verified by an expert. We obtain a system that automatically labels a recording as a good or bad sound, and additionally identifies the precise nature of the misarticulation with a view to providing corrective feedback to the player. We find that acoustic features that are sensitive to the relatively small deviations from the good sound due to poorly articulated strokes are not necessarily the features that have proved successful in the recognition of strokes corresponding to distinct tabla bols as required for music transcription.;"Krish Narang, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education;Preeti Rao, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education";IIT Bombay, IIT Bombay;education, education;IND, IND;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;44.801224;-39.740173
"Jilt Sebastian;Hema A. Murthy";Onset Detection in Composition Items of Carnatic Music.;2017;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1414830;Complex rhythmic patterns associated with Carnatic music are revealed from the stroke locations of percussion instruments. However, a comprehensive approach for the detection of these locations from composition items is lacking. This is a challenging problem since the melodic sounds (typically vocal and violin) generate soft-onset locations which result in a number of false alarms. In this work, a separation-driven onset detection approach is proposed. Percussive separation is performed using a Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) in the first stage. A single model is used to separate the percussive vs the non-percussive sounds using discriminative training and time-frequency masking. This is then followed by an onset detection stage based on group delay (GD) processing on the separated percussive track. The proposed approach is evaluated on a large dataset of live Carnatic music concert recordings and compared against percussive separation and onset detection baselines. The separation performance is significantly better than that of Harmonic-Percussive Separation (HPS) algorithm and onset detection performance is better than the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based algorithm. The proposed approach has an absolute improvement of 18.4% compared with the detection algorithm applied directly on the composition items.;"Jilt Sebastian, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, IND, education;Hema A.

These are transcribed, preprocessed, and used to build a reference database via a robust symbolic fingerprinting algorithm, which in turn is used to identify new, incoming queries. The main challenge is the amount of noise that is introduced into the identification process by the music transcription algorithm and the automatic (but possibly suboptimal) choice of performances to represent a piece in the reference database. In a number of experiments we show how to improve the identification performance by increasing redundancy in the reference database and by using a preprocessing step to rate the reference performances regarding their suitability as a representation of the pieces in question.

It is known that to accurately align piano performances, methods using the voice structure are needed. However, such methods typically have high computational cost and they are applicable only when prior voice information is given. It is pointed out that alignment errors are typically accompanied by performance errors in the aligned signal. This suggests the possibility of correcting (or realigning) preliminary results by a fast (but not-so-accurate) alignment method with a refined method applied to limited segments of aligned signals, to save the computational cost. To realise this, we develop a method for detecting performance errors and a realignment method that works fast and accurately in local regions around performance errors. To remove the dependence on prior voice information, voice separation is performed to the reference signal in the local regions. By applying our method to results obtained by previously proposed hidden Markov models, the highest accuracies are achieved with short computation time.

To solve this, we formulate a hierarchical generative model consisting of (1) a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) for chords incorporating their syntactic functions, (2) a metrical Markov model describing chord rhythms, and (3) a Markov model generating melodies conditionally on a chord sequence. To estimate a variable-length chord sequence for a given melody, we iteratively refine the latent tree structure and the chord symbols and rhythms using a Metropolis-Hastings sampler with split-merge operations. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperformed the HMM-based method in terms of predictive abilities.;"Hiroaki Tsushima, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Eita Nakamura, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Katsutoshi Itoyama, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Kazuyoshi Yoshii, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education, RIKEN AIP, JPN, facility";Kyoto University, Kyoto University, Kyoto University,Kyoto University;education, education, education, education;JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;26.980019;-47.49094

Since the onset times and F0s of sung notes are considerably deviated from the discrete tatums and pitches indicated in a musical score, a score model is crucial for improving time-frequency quantization of the F0s. We thus propose a hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model (HHSMM) that combines a score model representing the rhythms and pitches of musical notes with musical scales with an F0 model representing time-frequency deviations from a note sequence specified by a score. In the score model, musical scales are generated stochastically. Note pitches are then generated according to the scales and note onsets are generated according to a Markov process defined on the tatum grid. In the F0 model, onset deviations, smooth note-to-note F0 transitions, and F0 deviations are generated stochastically and added to the note sequence. Given an F0 trajectory, our method estimates the most likely sequence of musical notes while giving more importance on the score model than the F0 model. Experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed an HMM-based method having no models of scales and rhythms.;"Ryo Nishikimi, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Eita Nakamura, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility;Katsutoshi Itoyama, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Kazuyoshi Yoshii, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, JPN, education, RIKEN AIP, JPN, facility";Kyoto University, Kyoto University, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Kyoto University, Kyoto University;education, education, facility, education, education;JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;26.803944;-5.788057

Traditionally, this goal is achieved by performing preprocesses of binarization and staff-line removal. However, these are commonly performed using heuristics that do not generalize widely when applied to different types of documents such as medieval scores. In this paper we propose an effective and generalizable approach to address this problem in one step. Our proposal classifies each pixel of the image among background, staff lines, and symbols using supervised learning techniques, namely convolutional neural networks. Experiments on a set of medieval music pages proved that the proposed approach is very accurate, achieving a performance upwards of 90% and outperforming common ensembles of binarization and staff-line removal algorithms.;"Jorge Calvo-Zaragoza, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, education;Gabriel Vigliensoni, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, education;Ichiro Fujinaga, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, education";McGill University, McGill University, McGill University;education, education, education;CAN, CAN, CAN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-2.3192894;-50.316093

On the contrary, human composers write music in a nonlinear fashion, scribbling motifs here and there, often revisiting choices previously made. In order to better approximate this process, we train a convolutional neural network to complete partial musical scores, and explore the use of blocked Gibbs sampling as an analogue to rewriting. Neither the model nor the generative procedure are tied to a particular causal direction of composition. Our model is an instance of orderless NADE [36], which allows more direct ancestral sampling. However, we find that Gibbs sampling greatly improves sample quality, which we demonstrate to be due to some conditional distributions being poorly modeled. Moreover, we show that even the cheap approximate blocked Gibbs procedure from [40] yields better samples than ancestral sampling, based on both log-likelihood and human evaluation.;"Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang, MILA, Université de Montréal, CAN, education, Google Brain, USA, company;Tim Cooijmans, MILA, Université de Montréal, CAN, education, Google Brain, USA, company;Adam Roberts, Google Brain, USA, company;Aaron Courville, MILA, Université de Montréal, CAN, education;Douglas Eck, Google Brain, USA, company";MILA, Google Brain, MILA, Google Brain, MILA, Google Brain;education, company, education, company, education, company;CAN, USA, CAN, USA, CAN, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-7.2921395;-48.99311

Technical barriers include the processing of overlapped notes, repeated note sequences, and silence. Most of these characteristics vary with expressions. In this paper, the audio-to-score alignment problem of expressive violin performance is addressed. We propose a two-stage alignment system composed of the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm, simulation of overlapped sustain notes, background noise model, silence detection, and reﬁnement process, to better capture the onset. More importantly, we utilize the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method for synthesis of the reference signal in order to deal with highly diverse timbre in real-world performance. A dataset of annotated expressive violin recordings in which each piece is played with various expressive musical terms is used. The optimal choice of basic parameters considered in conventional alignment systems, such as features, distance functions in DTW, synthesis methods for the reference signal, and energy ratios, is analyzed. Different settings on different expressions are compared and discussed.

However, structure is actually multi-dimensional: in a typical piece of music, individual instrument parts can repeat themselves in independent ways, and sections can be homogeneous with respect to several parts or only one part. We propose a novel MIR task, multi-part pattern analysis, that requires the discovery of repeated patterns within instrument parts. To discover repeated patterns in individual voices, we propose an algorithm that applies source separation and then tailors the structure analysis to each estimated source, using a novel technique to resolve transitivity errors. Creating ground truth for this task by hand would be infeasible for a large corpus, so we generate a synthetic corpus from MIDI files. We synthesize audio and produce measure-by-measure descriptions of which instruments are active and which repeat themselves exactly.

Although previous studies applied latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to lyrics to analyze topics, LDA was not able to capture the artist’s taste. In this paper, we propose a topic model that can deal with the artist’s taste for topics of lyrics. Our model assumes each artist has a topic distribution and a topic is assigned to each song according to the distribution. Our experimental results using a real-world dataset show that our model outperforms LDA in terms of the perplexity. By applying our model to estimate topics of 147,990 lyrics by 3,722 artists, we implement a web service called Lyric Jumper that enables users to explore lyrics based on the estimated topics.

To evaluate our approach, we use a synthetic dataset of music clips, all designed to have ambiguous structure, that was previously used and validated in a psychology experiment. We ﬁnd that, compared to a previous optimization-based algorithm, our correlation-based approach is better able to predict the rationale for an analysis.

In this paper, we investigate how to exploit the words extracted from playlist titles for text-based music retrieval. The main idea is to represent songs and words in a common latent space so that the music retrieval is converted to the problem of selecting songs that are the nearest neighbors of the query word in the latent space. Specifically, an unsupervised learning method is proposed to generate a latent representation of songs and words, where the learning objects are the co-occurring songs and words in playlist titles. Five metrics (precision, recall, coherence, diversity, and popularity) are considered for performance evaluation of the proposed method.

We are particularly interested in being able to identify songs which are intelligible to second language learners, as such individuals often sing along the song to help them learn their second language, but this is only helpful if the song is intelligible enough for them to understand. As no automatic system for identifying ‘intelligible’ songs currently exists, songs for second language learners are generally selected by hand, a time-consuming and onerous process. We conducted an experiment in which test subjects, all of whom are learning English as a second language, were presented with 100 excerpts of songs drawn from five different genres. The test subjects listened to and transcribed the excerpts and the intelligibility of each excerpt was assessed based on average transcription accuracy across subjects. Excerpts that were more accurately transcribed on average were considered to be more intelligible than those less accurately transcribed on average. We then tested standard acoustic features to determine which were most strongly correlated with intelligibility. Our final system classifies the intelligibility of the excerpts and achieves 66% accuracy for 3 classes of intelligibility.;"Karim M.

In this paper, we demonstrate a proof-of-principle for automatic pronunciation evaluation in singing using a knowledge-based approach with limited data in an automatic speech recognition (ASR) framework. To demonstrate our approach, we derive mispronunciation rules specific to South-East Asian English accents in singing based on a comparative study of the pronunciation error patterns in singing versus speech. Using training data restricted to American English speech, we evaluate different methods involving the deduced L1-specific (native language) rules for singing. In the absence of L1 phone models, we incorporate the derived pronunciation variations in the ASR framework via a novel approach that combines acoustic models for sub-phonetic segments to represent the missing L1 phones. The word-level assessment achieved by the system on singing and speech is similar, indicating that it is a promising scheme for realizing a full-fledged pronunciation evaluation system for singing in future.";"Chitralekha Gupta, National University of Singapore, SGP, education, NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering, National University of Singapore, SGP, education;David Grunberg, National University of Singapore, SGP, education;Preeti Rao, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education;Ye Wang, National University of Singapore, SGP, education";National University of Singapore, National University of Singapore, IIT Bombay, National University of Singapore;education, education, education, education;SGP, SGP, IND, SGP;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;31.031328;-6.717511

We first investigate genre recognition and present evidence that incorporating discourse features allow for more accurate genre classification than single-sentence lyric features do. Similarly, we examine the problem of release date estimation by passing features to classifiers to determine the release period of a particular song, and again determine that an assistance from discourse-based features allow for superior classification relative to single-sentence lyric features alone.

This process is labor intensive and time consuming, and consequently existing annotated datasets are very limited in size.

Any estimation errors are now reﬂected in the synthesized audio, meaning the tracker’s output represents an accurate annotation. Analysis is performed using a wide-band harmonic sinusoidal modeling algorithm which estimates the frequency, amplitude and phase of every harmonic, meaning the synthesized track closely resembles the original in terms of timbre and dynamics. Finally the synthesized track is automatically mixed back into the multitrack. The framework can be used to annotate multitrack datasets for training learning-based algorithms. Furthermore, we show that algorithms evaluated on the automatically generated/annotated mixes produce results that are statistically indistinguishable from those they produce on the original, manually annotated, mixes.

We propose a machine learning model for chord recognition that uses semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields (semi-CRFs) to perform a joint segmentation and labeling of symbolic music. One beneﬁt of using a semi-Markov model is that it enables the utilization of segment-level features, such as segment purity and chord coverage, that capture the extent to which the events in an entire segment of music are compatible with a candidate chord label. Correspondingly, we develop a rich set of segment-level features for a semi-CRF model that also incorporates the likelihood of a large number of chord-to-chord transitions. Evaluations on a dataset of Bach chorales and a corpus of theme and variations for piano by Beethoven and Mozart show that the proposed semi-CRF model outperforms a discriminatively trained Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that does sequential labeling of sounding events, thus demonstrating the suitability of semi-Markov models for joint segmentation and labeling of music.;"Kristen Masada, Ohio University, USA, education;Razvan Bunescu, Ohio University, USA, education";Ohio University, Ohio University;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;30.615088;-54.9491

We observed signiﬁcant differences between individual and interactional intonation, more speciﬁcally: 1) Singing without the bass part has less mean absolute pitch error than singing with all vocal parts; 2) Mean absolute melodic interval error increases when participants can hear the other parts; 3) Mean absolute harmonic interval error is higher in the one-way interaction condition than the two-way interaction condition; and 4) Singers produce more stable notes when singing solo than with their partners.";"Jiajie Dai, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London, United Kingdom, education;Simon Dixon, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London, United Kingdom, education";Queen Mary University of London,Queen Mary University of London;education, education;GBR, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;23.570843;-7.448424

While some machine learning models (e.g., decision trees) are transparent, the majority of models used today are still black-boxes. Recent work in machine learning aims to analyse these models by explaining the basis of their decisions. In this work, we extend one such technique, called local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, to music content analysis. We propose three versions of explanations: one version is based on temporal segmentation, and the other two are based on frequency and time-frequency segmentation. These explanations provide meaningful ways to understand the factors that influence the classification of specific input data. We apply our proposed methods to three singing voice detection systems: the first two are designed using decision tree and random forest classifiers, respectively; the third system is based on convolutional neural network. The explanations we generate provide insights into the model behaviour. We use these insights to demonstrate that despite achieving 71.4% classification accuracy, the decision tree model fails to generalise. We also demonstrate that the model-agnostic explanations for the neural network model agree in many cases with the model-dependent saliency maps.

We start by reﬂecting on the reasons why the work on loops was successful and argue that it is an example of the ideal scenario in which it is possible to deﬁne a conﬁdence measure independently of the estimation algorithm. This requires additional domain knowledge not used by the estimation algorithm, which is rarely available. Therefore we move our focus to deﬁning conﬁdence measures for hidden Markov models, a technique used in multiple music information retrieval systems and beyond. We propose two measures that are oblivious to the speciﬁc labelling task, trading off performance for computational requirements. They are experimentally validated by means of a chord estimation task.

This paper presents a novel method of generating chord sequences from a symbolic melody using bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) networks trained on a lead sheet database. To this end, a group of feature vectors composed of 12 semitones is extracted from the notes in each bar of monophonic melodies. In order to ensure that the data shares uniform key and duration characteristics, the key and the time signatures of the vectors are normalized. The BLSTM networks then learn from the data to incorporate the temporal dependencies to produce a chord progression. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations are conducted by comparing the proposed method with the conventional HMM and DNN-HMM based approaches. Proposed model achieves 23.8% and 11.4% performance increase from the other models, respectively.

Furthermore, since the similarity measure is query-dependent, it cannot represent an absolute distance measure. In this paper, we present a novel approach to tackle the cover song identiﬁcation problem from a new perspective. We ﬁrst construct a set of core songs, and represent each song in a high-dimensional space where each dimension indicates the pairwise distance between the given song and the other in the pre-deﬁned core set. There are several advantages to this. First, using a number of reference songs in the core set, we make the most of relative distances to many other songs. Second, as all songs are transformed into the same high-dimensional space, kernel methods and metric learning are exploited for distance computation. Third, our approach does not depend on the computation method for the pairwise distance, and thus can use any existing algorithms. Experimental results conﬁrm that the proposed approach achieved a large performance gain compared to the state-of-the-art methods.;"Hoon Heo, Music and Audio Research Group, Seoul National University, KOR, education;Hyunwoo J.

Although such research suggests that the criterion for similarity judgement varies with respect to the musical style of the content being compared, the speciﬁc musical factors which shape this criterion are unknown. Since dimensional complexity differentiates musical genres, and has been shown to affect similarity judgements following lifelong exposure, this experiment investigates the short-term inﬂuence of dimensional complexity on similarity judgements. Rhythmic and pitch sequences with two levels of complexity were factorially combined to create four distinct types of prototype melodies. 51 participants rated the similarity of each type of prototype melody (M) to two variations, one in which the pitch content was modiﬁed ( ¯ Mp), and another in which the rhythmic content was modiﬁed ( ¯ Mr). The results indicate that rhythm and pitch complexity both play a signiﬁcant role, inﬂuencing the perceived similarity of ¯ Mp, and ¯ Mr. The dimension bearing low complexity information was found to be the predominant factor in similarity judgements, as participants found modiﬁcations to this dimension to signiﬁcantly decrease perceived similarity.;"Jeff Ens, Simon Fraser University, CAN, education;Bernhard E.

However, these techniques are still unable to capture and generate artifacts that are convincingly structured. In particular, musical sequences do not exhibit pattern structure, as typically found in human composed music. We present an approach to generate structured sequences, based on a mechanism for sampling efficiently variations of musical sequences. Given an input sequence and a statistical model, this mechanism uses belief propagation to sample a set of sequences whose distance to the input sequence is approximately within specified bounds. This mechanism uses local fields to bias the generation. We show experimentally that sampled sequences are indeed closely correlated to the standard musical similarity function defined by Mongeau and Sankoff. We then show how this mechanism can be used to implement composition strategies that enforce arbitrary structure on a musical lead sheet generation problem.

In this study we apply recurrent neural network models to classify a large dataset of intact song lyrics. As lyrics exhibit a hierarchical layer structure—in which words combine to form lines, lines form segments, and segments form a complete song—we adapt a hierarchical attention network (HAN) to exploit these layers and in addition learn the importance of the words, lines, and segments. We test the model over a 117-genre dataset and a reduced 20-genre dataset. Experimental results show that the HAN outperforms both non-neural models and simpler neural models, whilst also classifying over a higher number of genres than previous research. Through the learning process we can also visualise which words or lines in a song the model believes are important to classifying the genre.

The possibility of leveraging neural systems via brain-computer interfaces is an alternative approach to annotating music. Here we test this idea by measuring correlations between musical features and brain responses in a statistically optimal fashion. Using an extensive dataset of electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to a variety of natural music stimuli, we employed Canonical Correlation Analysis to identify spatial EEG components that track temporal stimulus components. We found multiple statistically significant dimensions of stimulus-response correlation (SRC) for all songs studied. The temporal filters that maximize correlation with the neural response highlight harmonics and subharmonics of that song’s beat frequency, with different harmonics emphasized by different components. The most stimulus-driven component of the EEG has an anatomically plausible, symmetric frontocentral topography that is preserved across stimuli. Our results suggest that different neural circuits encode different temporal hierarchies of natural music.

We explore informed automatic meter analysis, in which varying levels of prior information about the metrical structure of the music piece is available to analysis algorithms. We formulate different informed meter analysis tasks and discuss their practical applications, with a focus on Indian art music. We then adapt state of the art Bayesian meter analysis methods to these tasks and evaluate them on corpora of Indian art music. The experiments show that the use of additional information aids meter analysis and improves automatic meter analysis performance, with significant gains for analysis of downbeats.;"Ajay Srinivasamurthy, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Andre Holzapfel, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SWE, education;Xavier Serra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education, education;ESP, SWE, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;2.7812784;-0.92490804

Starting with a hypothesis that the knowledge of the current position in a metrical cycle (i.e. metrical accent) can improve the accuracy of vocal note onset detection, we propose a novel probabilistic model to jointly track beats and vocal note onsets. The proposed model extends a state of the art model for beat and meter tracking, in which a-priori probability of a note at a specific metrical accent interacts with the probability of observing a vocal note onset. We carry out an evaluation on a varied collection of multi-instrument datasets from two music traditions (English popular music and Turkish makam) with different types of metrical cycles and singing styles. Results confirm that the proposed model reasonably improves vocal note onset detection accuracy compared to a baseline model that does not take metrical position into account.;"Georgi Dzhambazov, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Andre Holzapfel, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SWE, education;Ajay Srinivasamurthy, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Xavier Serra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education, education, education;ESP, SWE, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;41.5686;3.1869445

Although these categories are not mutually exclusive, most related research is traditionally focused on classifying tracks into a single class. Furthermore, these categories (e.g., Pop, Rock) tend to be too broad for certain applications. In this work we aim to expand this task by categorizing musical items into multiple and ﬁne-grained labels, using three different data modalities: audio, text, and images. To this end we present MuMu, a new dataset of more than 31k albums classiﬁed into 250 genre classes. For every album we have collected the cover image, text reviews, and audio tracks. Additionally, we propose an approach for multi-label genre classiﬁcation based on the combination of feature embeddings learned with state-of-the-art deep learning methodologies. Experiments show major differences between modalities, which not only introduce new baselines for multi-label genre classiﬁcation, but also suggest that combining them yields improved results.;"Sergio Oramas, Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Oriol Nieto, Pandora Media Inc., USA, company;Francesco Barbieri, TALN Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Xavier Serra, Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Pandora, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, company, education, education;ESP, USA, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-2.3983235;29.728153

In this paper we propose to explore Discogs, one of the largest databases of such data available in the public domain. Our main goal is to show how large-scale analysis of its editorial metadata can raise questions and serve as a tool for musicological research on a number of example studies. The metadata that we use describes music releases, such as albums or EPs. It includes information about artists, tracks and their durations, genre and style, format (such as vinyl, CD, or digital files), year and country of each release. Using this data we study correlations between different genre and style labels, assess their specificity and analyze typical track durations. We estimate trends in prevalence of different genres, styles, and formats across different time periods. In our analysis of styles we use electronic music as an example. Our contribution also includes the tools we developed for our analysis and the generated datasets that can be re-used by MIR researchers and musicologists.;"Dmitry Bogdanov, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Xavier Serra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education;ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-52.213425;10.92379

Music scores are an important resource for the musicological research of this tradition, but no machine readable ones have been available for computational analysis. In order to explore the potential of symbolic score data for jingju music research, we have expanded the CompMusic Jingju Music Corpus, which contains mostly audio, with a collection of 92 machine readable scores, for a total of 897 melodic lines. Since our purpose is the study of jingju singing in terms of its musical system elements, we have selected the arias used as examples in reference jingju music textbooks. The collection is accompanied by scores metadata, curated annotations per score and melodic line, and a set of software tools for extracting statistical information from it. All the gathered data and developed software are available for research purposes. In this paper we first discuss the culture specific concepts that are needed for understanding the contents of the collection, followed by a detailed description of it. We then present a series of computational analyses performed on the scores and discuss some musicological findings.;"Rafael Caro Repetto, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Xavier Serra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education;ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;24.041042;-2.1326196

The proposed method estimates the most likely sequence of syllable boundaries given the estimated syllable onset detection function (ODF) and its score. Throughout the paper, we first examine the jingju syllables structure and propose a definition of the term “syllable onset”. Then, we identify which are the challenges that jingju a cappella singing poses. Further, we investigate how to improve the syllable ODF estimation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We propose a novel CNN architecture that allows to efficiently capture different time-frequency scales for estimating syllable onsets. Besides, we propose using a score-informed Viterbi algorithm – instead of thresholding the onset function–, because the available musical knowledge we have (the score) can be used to inform the Viterbi algorithm to overcome the identified challenges. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in syllable segmentation for jingju a cappella singing. We further provide an analysis of the segmentation errors which points possible research directions.;"Jordi Pons, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Rong Gong, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Xavier Serra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education, education;ESP, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;34.854588;-6.0998693

Recently, deep learning approaches have outperformed NMF methods in terms of separation quality and processing time, and there is scope to extend them with score information. In this paper, we propose a score-informed separation system for classical music that is based on deep learning. We propose a method to derive training features from audio ﬁles and the corresponding coarsely aligned scores for a set of classical music pieces. Additionally, we introduce a convolutional neural network architecture (CNN) with the goal of estimating time-frequency masks for source separation. Our system is trained with synthetic renditions derived from the original scores and can be used to separate real-life performances based on the same scores, provided a coarse audio-to-score alignment. The proposed system achieves better performance (SDR and SIR) and is less computationally intensive than a score-informed NMF system on a dataset comprising Bach chorales.;"Marius Miron, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Jordi Janer, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Emilia Gómez, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education, education;ESP, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;41.56972;-22.923569

We argue that, due to the existence of a basic melodic contour for each mode in jingju music, only using melodic information (such as pitch contour) will result in an ambiguous matching. This leads us to propose a matching approach based on the use of phonetic and duration information. Phonetic information is extracted with an acoustic model shaped with our data, and duration information is considered with the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) variants we investigate. We build a model for each lyric path in our scores and we achieve the matching by ranking the posterior probabilities of the decoded most likely state sequences. Three acoustic models are investigated: (i) convolutional neural networks (CNNs), (ii) deep neural networks (DNNs) and (iii) Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). Also, two duration models are compared: (i) hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) and (ii) post-processor duration model. Results show that CNNs perform better in our (small) audio dataset and also that HSMM outperforms the post-processor duration model.;"Rong Gong, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Jordi Pons, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Xavier Serra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education, education;ESP, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;27.749388;11.58186

In this paper, we ﬁrst report the work on a comprehensive corpus of jingju lyrics that we built, suitable for text mining and text analysis in a data-driven framework. Utilizing this corpus, we propose a novel approach to study the expressive functions of banshi by applying text analysis techniques on lyrics. First we apply topic modeling techniques to jingju lyrics text documents grouped at different levels according to the banshi they are associated with. We then experiment with several different document vector representations of lyrics in a series of document classiﬁcation experiments. The topic modeling results showed that sentiment polarity (positive or negative) is better distinguished between different shengqiang-banshi (a more ﬁne grained partition of banshi) than banshi alone, and we are able to achieve high accuracy scores in classifying lyrics documents into different banshi categories. We discuss the technical and musicological implications and possible future improvements.;"Shuo Zhang, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Rafael Caro Repetto, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Xavier Serra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education, education;ESP, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-1.1994201;48.08758

Among the common shortcomings are the lack of transparency in their creation and the difficulty of making them completely open and sharable. They often do not include clear mechanisms to amend errors and many times they are not large enough for current machine learning needs. This paper introduces Freesound Datasets, an online platform for the collaborative creation of open audio datasets based on principles of transparency, openness, dynamic character, and sustainability. As a proof-of-concept, we present an early snapshot of a large-scale audio dataset built using this platform.

However, beyond the sequential nature of musical content, relations and dependencies within a music segment can be more efﬁciently modeled as a graph. Polytopic Graphs have been recently introduced to model music structure so as to account for multiscale relationships between events located at metrically homologous instants. In this paper, we focus on the description of chord sequences and we study a speciﬁc set of graph conﬁgurations, called Primer Preserving Permutations (PPP). For sequences of 16 chords, PPPs account for 6 different latent systems of relations, corresponding to 6 main structural patterns (Prototypical Carrier Sequences or PCS). Observed chord sequences can be viewed as distorted versions of these PCS and the corresponding optimal PPP is estimated by minimizing a description cost over the latent relations. After presenting the main concepts of this approach, the article provides a detailed study of PPPs across a corpus of 727 chord sequences annotated from the RWC POP database (100 pop songs).

The goal is to develop algorithms that automatically identify segmenting time points in music that closely matches human annotated data. The annotation itself is challenging due to its subjective nature, such as the degree of change that constitutes a boundary, the location of such boundaries, and whether a boundary should be assigned to a single time frame or a range of frames. Existing datasets have been annotated by small number of experts and the annotators tend to be constrained to specific definitions of segmentation boundaries. In this paper, we re-examine the annotation problem. We crowdsource the problem to a large number of annotators and present an analysis of the results. Our preliminary study suggests that although there is a correlation to existing datasets, this form of annotations reveals additional information such as stronger vs. weaker boundaries, gradual vs. sudden boundaries, and the difference in perception of boundaries between musicians and non-musicians.

Music produced by pure rule-based systems often sounds mechanical. Music produced by machine learning sounds better, but still lacks hierarchical temporal structure. We restore temporal hierarchy by augmenting machine learning with a temporal production grammar, which generates the music’s overall structure and chord progressions. A compatible melody is then generated by a conditional variational recurrent autoencoder. The autoencoder is trained with eight-measure segments from a corpus of 10,000 MIDI files, each of which has had its melody track and chord progressions identified heuristically. The autoencoder maps melody into a multi-dimensional feature space, conditioned by the underlying chord progression. A melody is then generated by feeding a random sample from that space to the autoencoder’s decoder, along with the chord progression generated by the grammar. The autoencoder can make musically plausible variations on an existing melody, suitable for recurring motifs. It can also reharmonize a melody to a new chord progression, keeping the rhythm and contour.

In this paper we present a platform for multi-way communication between collaborating musicians through the dynamic modiﬁcation of digital parts: the Music Encoding and Linked Data (MELD) framework for distributed real-time annotation of digital music scores. MELD users and software agents create semantic annotations of music concepts and relationships, which are associated with musical structure speciﬁed by the Music Encoding Initiative schema (MEI). Annotations are expressed in RDF, allowing alternative music vocabularies (e.g., popular vs. classical music structures) to be applied. The same underlying framework retrieves, distributes, and processes information that addresses semantically distinguishable music elements.

Thousands of scores have been digitised by music libraries across the world, but the absence of symbolically codiﬁed information makes these inaccessible for computational evaluation. Optical Music Recognition (OMR) made great progress in addressing this issue, however, early notation is still an on-going challenge for OMR. To this end, we present the Symbolically Encoded Il Lauro Secco (SEILS) dataset, a new dataset of codiﬁed scores for use within computational musicology. We focus on a collection of Italian madrigals from the 16th century, a polyphonic secular a cappella composition characterised by strong musical-linguistic synergies. Thirty madrigals for ﬁve unaccompanied voices are presented in modern and early notation, considering a variety of digital formats: Lilypond, Music XML, MIDI, and Finale (a total of 150 symbolically codiﬁed scores). Given the musical and poetic value of the chosen repertoire, we aim to promote synergies between computational musicology and linguistics.;"Emilia Parada-Cabaleiro, University of Passau, DEU, education, Augsburg University, DEU, education;Anton Batliner, University of Passau, DEU, education, Augsburg University, DEU, education;Alice Baird, University of Passau, DEU, education, Augsburg University, DEU, education;Björn W.

"Andrea Cogliati;Zhiyao Duan";A Metric for Music Notation Transcription Accuracy.;2017;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415830;Automatic music transcription aims at transcribing musical performances into music notation. However, most existing transcription systems only focus on parametric transcription, i.e., they output a symbolic representation in absolute terms, showing frequency and absolute time (e.g., a piano-roll representation), but not in musical terms, with spelling distinctions (e.g., A♭ versus G♯) and quantized meter. Recent attempts at producing full music notation output have been hindered by the lack of an objective metric to measure the adherence of the results to the ground truth music score, and had to rely on time-consuming human evaluation by music theorists. In this paper, we propose an edit distance, similar to the Levenshtein Distance used for measuring the difference between two sequences, typically strings of characters. The metric treats a music score as a sequence of sets of musical objects, ordered by their onsets. The metric reports the differences between two music scores based on twelve aspects: barlines, clefs, key signatures, time signatures, notes, note spelling, note durations, stem directions, groupings, rests, rest duration, and staff assignment. We also apply a linear regression model to the metric in order to predict human evaluations on a dataset of short music excerpts automatically transcribed into music notation.;"Andrea Cogliati, University of Rochester, USA, education;Zhiyao Duan, University of Rochester, USA, education";University of Rochester, University of Rochester;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;14.973403;-24.072685

Automatic vibrato detection and analysis, although well studied for monophonic music, has rarely been explored for polyphonic music, because of the challenge in multi-pitch analysis. We propose a video-based approach for detecting and analyzing vibrato in polyphonic string music. Specifically, we capture the fine motion of the left hand of string players through optical flow analysis of video frames. We explore two methods. The first uses a feature extraction and SVM classification pipeline, and the second is an unsupervised technique based on autocorrelation analysis of the principal motion component. The proposed methods are compared with audio-only methods applied to individual instrument tracks separated from original audio mixture using the score. Experiments show that the proposed video-based methods achieve a significantly higher vibrato detection accuracy than the audio-based methods especially in high polyphony cases. Further experiments also demonstrate the utility of the approach in vibrato rate and extent analysis.;"Bochen Li, University of Rochester, USA, education;Karthik Dinesh, University of Rochester, USA, education;Gaurav Sharma, University of Rochester, USA, education;Zhiyao Duan, University of Rochester, USA, education";University of Rochester, University of Rochester, University of Rochester, University of Rochester;education, education, education, education;USA, USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;36.822365;4.098873

We present a newly created dataset containing several hundreds of offertory melodies, which are the longest and most complex within the total body of chant melodies. For each tradition, we train n-gram language models on a representation of the chants as sequence of chromatic intervals. By computing perplexi-ties of the melodies, we get an indication of the relations between the traditions, revealing the melodies of the Gre-gorian tradition as most diverse. Next, we perform a classi-ﬁcation experiment using global features of the melodies. The choice of features is informed by expert knowledge. We use properties of the intervallic content of the melodies, and properties of the melismas, revealing that signiﬁcant differences exist between the traditions. For example, the Gregorian melodies contain less step-wise intervals com-pared to the other repertoires. Finally, we train a classiﬁer on the perplexities as computed with the n-gram models, resulting in a very reliable classiﬁer.;"Peter van Kranenburg, Utrecht University, Meertens Institute, NLD, education;Geert Maessen, independent scholar, ,";Utrecht University, unknown;education, unknown;NLD, unknown;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-10.721716;-12.99489

Based on the improvements brought by using data fusion methods to ﬁnd the consensus of algorithms on other MIR tasks, we hypothesize that fusing the output from musical pattern discovery algorithms will improve the pattern discovery results. In this paper, we explore two methods to combine the pattern output from ten state-of-the-art algorithms using two datasets. Both provide human-annotated patterns as ground truth. We show that ﬁnding the consensus among the output of different musical pattern discovery algorithms is challenging for two reasons: First, the number of patterns found by the algorithms exceeds patterns in human annotations by several orders of magnitude, with little agreement on what constitutes a pattern. Second, the algorithms perform inconsistently across different pieces. We show that algorithms lack a consensus with each other. Therefore, it is difﬁcult to harness the collective wisdom of the algorithms to ﬁnd ground truth patterns. The main contribution of this paper is a meta-analysis of the (dis)similarities among pattern discovery algorithms’ output and using the output in two fusion methods.

To this end, we introduce and compare different architectures for this task, i.e., recurrent, convolutional, and recurrent-convolutional neural networks. We evaluate our systems on two well-known data sets and an additional new data set containing both drum and beat annotations.

Akira Maezawa;Fast and Accurate: Improving a Simple Beat Tracker with a Selectively-Applied Deep Beat Identification.;2017;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415520;In music applications, audio beat tracking is a central component that requires both speed and accuracy, but a fast beat tracker typically has many beat phase errors, while an accurate one typically requires more computation. This paper achieves a fast tracking speed and a low beat phase error by applying a slow but accurate beat phase detector at only the most informative spots in a given song, and interpolating the rest by a fast tatum-level tracker. We present (1) a framework for selecting a small subset of the tatum indices that information-theoretically best describes the beat phases of the song, (2) a fast HMM-based beat tracker for tatum tracking, and (3) an accurate but slow beat detector using a deep neural network (DNN). The evaluations demonstrate that the proposed DNN beat phase detection halves the beat phase error of the HMM-based tracker and enables a 98% decrease in the required number of DNN invocations without dropping the accuracy.;Akira Maezawa, Yamaha Corporation, JPN, company;Yamaha Corporation;company;JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;56.74505;6.004462

The existing literature on the effect of duration on timbre recognition shows high performance for remarkably short time window lengths, but does not address the possible effect of musical training. In this study, we applied an adaptive procedure to investigate the effect of musical training on individual thresholds for instrument identification. A timbre discrimination task consisting of a 4-alternative forced choice (4AFC) of brief instrument sounds with varying duration was assigned to 16 test subjects using an adaptive staircase method. The effect of musical training has been investigated by dividing the participants into two groups: musicians and non-musicians. The experiment showed lowest thresholds for the guitar sound and highest for the violin sound, with a high overall performance level, but no significant difference between the two groups. It is suggested that the test subjects adjust the weightings of the perceptual dimensions of timbre according to different degrees of acoustic degradation of the stimuli, which are evaluated both by plotting extracted audio features in a feature space and by considering the timbral specificities of the four instruments.;"Francesco Bigoni, Aalborg University – Copenhagen, DNK, education;Sofia Dahl, Aalborg University – Copenhagen, DNK, education";Aalborg University, Aalborg University;education, education;DNK, DNK;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;30.594261;-22.74894

This practical problem aims to alter the style of a given music piece from one to another while preserving the essence of that piece, such as melody and chord progression. In particular, we discuss the style transfer of homophonic music, composed of a predominant melody part and an accompaniment part, where the latter is modified through Gibbs sampling on a generative model combining recurrent neural networks and autoregressive models.

Such an approach can benefit from a signal processing method that helps to enhance the true pitch contours on an image, and, a music language model with structural information on large-scale symbolic music data to be transfer into an audio-based model. In this paper, we propose a novel melody extraction system, using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with dilated convolution as the semantic segmentation tool. The candidate pitch contours on the time-frequency image are enhanced by combining the spectrogram and cepstral-based features. Moreover, an adaptive progressive neural network is employed to transfer the semantic segmentation model in the symbolic domain to the one in the audio domain.

Domain adaptation is an approach aiming to eliminate the distributional discrepancy of the modeling data, so as to transfer learnable knowledge from one domain to another. With its great success in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, domain adaptation also shows great potential in music processing, for music is essentially a highly-structured semantic system having domaindependent information. Our proposed model contains a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes the training data into a latent space, and the resulting latent representations along with its model parameters are then reused to regularize the representation learning of the downstream task where the data are in the other domain. The experiments on cross-domain music alignment, namely an audioto-MIDI alignment, and a monophonic-to-polyphonic music alignment of singing voice show that the learned representations lead to better higher alignment accuracy than that using conventional features. Furthermore, a preliminary experiment on singing voice source separation, by regarding the mixture and the voice as two distinct domains, also demonstrates the capability to solve music processing problems from the perspective of domain-adaptive representation learning.;"Yin-Jyun Luo, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, TWN, facility;Li Su, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, TWN, facility";Academia Sinica, Academia Sinica;facility, facility;TWN, TWN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;7.1781206;-11.758845
"Hao-Wen Dong;Yi-Hsuan Yang";Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks with Binary Neurons for Polyphonic Music Generation;2018;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1492377;It has been shown recently that deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (GANs) can learn to generate music in the form of piano-rolls, which represent music by binary-valued time-pitch matrices. However, existing models can only generate real-valued piano-rolls and require further post-processing, such as hard thresholding (HT) or Bernoulli sampling (BS), to obtain the final binaryvalued results. In this paper, we study whether we can have a convolutional GAN model that directly creates binaryvalued piano-rolls by using binary neurons. Specifically, we propose to append to the generator an additional refiner network, which uses binary neurons at the output layer. The whole network is trained in two stages. Firstly, the generator and the discriminator are pretrained. Then, the refiner network is trained along with the discriminator to learn to binarize the real-valued piano-rolls the pretrained generator creates. Experimental results show that using binary neurons instead of HT or BS indeed leads to better results in a number of objective measures. Moreover, deterministic binary neurons perform better than stochastic ones in both objective measures and a subjective test.

Moreover, we experiment with different ways to incorporate pitch information to our model, with the premise that doing so informs the model the notes that are active per frame, and also encourages the model to learn relative rates of energy buildup in the harmonic partials of different instruments.

As recently shown, such detectors have an important weakness: Since singing voice is correlated with sound level in training data, classifiers learn to become sensitive to input magnitude, and give different predictions for the same signal at different sound levels. Starting from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on logarithmic-magnitude mel spectrogram excerpts, we eliminate this dependency by forcing each first-layer convolutional filter to be zero-mean – that is, to have its coefficients sum to zero. In contrast to four other methods – data augmentation, instance normalization, spectral delta features, and per-channel energy normalization (PCEN) – that we evaluated on a largescale public dataset, zero-mean convolutions achieve perfect sound level invariance without any impact on prediction accuracy or computational requirements. We assume that zero-mean convolutions would be useful for other machine listening tasks requiring robustness to level changes.;"Jan Schlüter, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Vienna, AUT, facility;Bernhard Lehner, Institute of Computational Perception, Johannes Kepler University Linz, AUT, education";Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Johannes Kepler University;facility, education;AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;32.790855;-5.759626

For tasks that include framewise binary classification (e.g., onset detection, music transcription) classes are derived from output activation functions by identifying points of local maxima, or peaks. However, the operating principles behind peak picking are different to that of the cross entropy loss function, which minimises the absolute difference between the output and target values for a single frame. To generate activation functions more suited to peak-picking, we propose two versions of a new loss function that incorporates information from multiple time-steps: 1) multi-individual, which uses multiple individual time-step cross entropies; and 2) multi-difference, which directly compares the difference between sequential time-step outputs. We evaluate the newly proposed loss functions alongside standard cross entropy in the popular MIR tasks of onset detection and automatic drum transcription. The results highlight the effectiveness of these loss functions in the improvement of overall system accuracies for both MIR tasks.

When these conditions are not held, they often fail to generalise. We propose a game approach to ADT, termed player vs transcriber (PvT), in which a player model aims to reduce transcription accuracy of a transcriber model by manipulating training data in two ways. First, existing data may be augmented, allowing the transcriber to be trained using recordings with modified timbres. Second, additional individual recordings from sample libraries are included to generate rare combinations. We present three versions of the PvT model: AugExist, which augments pre-existing recordings; AugAddExist, which adds additional samples of drum hits to the AugExist system; and Generate, which generates training examples exclusively from individual drum hits from sample libraries. The three versions are evaluated alongside a state-of-the-art deep learning ADT system using two evaluation strategies. The results demonstrate that including the player network improves the ADT performance and suggests that this is due to improved generalisability.

Raw audio models, such as DeepMind's WaveNet, train directly on sampled audio waveforms, allowing them to produce realistic-sounding, albeit unstructured music. In this paper, we propose an automatic music generation methodology combining both of these approaches to create structured, realistic-sounding compositions.

Effectively each AHR within AsH is a section of the aligned hierarchies for the original song. Like aligned hierarchies, the AsH representation can be embedded into a classification space with a natural metric that makes inter-song comparisons based on sections of the songs.

However, it is often difficult to obtain live music audience data to tackle this task. In this work, we investigate whether important venues can instead be inferred through social media data. Our approach consists of employing bipartite graph ranking algorithms to help discover important venues in artist-venue graphs mined from Facebook. We use both well-established algorithms, such as BiRank, and a modification of their common iterative scheme that avoids the impact of possibly erroneous heuristics to the ranking, which we call VenueRank. Resulting venue ranks are compared to those obtained from feature extraction for predicting the most listened artists and large listener increments in Spotify. This comparison yields high correlation between venue importance for listener prediction and bipartite graph ranking algorithms, with VenueRank found more robust against overfitting.;"Emmanouil Krasanakis, CERTH-ITI, GRC, facility, AUTH, GRC, education;Emmanouil Schinas, CERTH-ITI, GRC, facility, AUTH, GRC, education;Symeon Papadopoulos, CERTH-ITI, GRC, facility;Yiannis Kompatsiaris, CERTH-ITI, GRC, facility;Pericles Mitkas, AUTH, GRC, education";CERTH-ITI , CERTH-ITI , CERTH-ITI , CERTH-ITI, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki;facility, facility, facility, facility, education;GRC, GRC, GRC, GRC, GRC;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-14.898057;42.98112

We show that a U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation combined with a trivial detector already establishes a high baseline for this task, and we propose tricks that further improve detection performance: training against convex hulls of symbol masks, and multichannel output models that enable feature sharing for semantically related symbols. The latter is helpful especially for clefs, which have severe impacts on the overall OMR result. We then integrate the networks into an OMR pipeline by applying a subsequent notation assembly stage, establishing a new baseline result for pitch inference in handwritten music at an f-score of 0.81.

Christopher Tralie;Cover Song Synthesis by Analogy;2018;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1492381;In this work, we pose and address the following cover song analogies problem: given a song A by artist 1 and a cover song A' of this song by artist 2, and given a different song B by artist 1, synthesize a song B' which is a cover of B in the style of artist 2. Normally, such a polyphonic style transfer problem would be quite challenging, but we show how the cover songs example constrains the problem, making it easier to solve. First, we extract the longest common beat-synchronous subsequence between A and A', and we time stretch the corresponding beat intervals in A' so that they align with A. We then derive a version of joint 2D convolutional NMF, which we apply to the constant-Q spectrograms of the synchronized segments to learn a translation dictionary of sound templates from A to A'. Finally, we apply the learned templates as filters to the song B, and we mash up the translated filtered components into the synthesized song B' using audio mosaicing. We showcase our algorithm on several examples, including a synthesized cover version of Michael Jackson's Bad by Alien Ant Farm, learned from the latter's Smooth Criminal cover.;Christopher J.

The MM-SIN generator is similar to a variational autoencoder or an adversarial network. However, the encoder or the discriminator are not learned, but computed with a scattering transform defined from prior information on sparse time-frequency audio properties. The generator is trained by jointly minimizing the reconstruction loss of an inverse problem, and a generation loss which computes a distance over scattering moments. It has a similar causal architecture as a WaveNet and provides a simpler mathematical model related to time-frequency decompositions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that this MMSIN generates new realistic musical signals. It can transform low-level musical attributes such as pitch with a linear transformation in the embedding space of scattering coefficients.;"Mathieu Andreux, D´epartement d’informatique de l’ENS, ´Ecole normale sup´erieure, CNRS, PSL Research University, FRA, education;St´ephane Mallat, D´epartement d’informatique de l’ENS, ´Ecole normale sup´erieure, CNRS, PSL Research University, FRA, education";École normale supérieure, École normale supérieure;education, education;FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;4.927528;-21.493725

Skipgrams have been found to be a powerful model for capturing semi-local dependencies in sequences of entities when dependencies may not be directly adjacent (see, for instance, the problems of modeling sequences of words or letters in computational linguistics). Since common skipgrams define locality based on indices, they can only be applied to a single stream of non-overlapping entities. This paper proposes a generalized skipgram model that allows arbitrary cost functions (defining locality), efficient filtering, recursive application (skipgrams over skipgrams), and memory efficient streaming. Further, a sampling mechanism is proposed that flexibly controls runtime and output size. These generalizations and optimizations make it possible to employ skipgrams for the discovery of repeated patterns of close, nonsimultaneous events or notes. The extensions to the skipgram model provided here do not only apply to musical notes but to any list of entities that is monotonic with respect to a given cost function.;"Christoph Finkensiep, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, CHE, education;Markus Neuwirth, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, CHE, education;Martin Rohrmeier, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, CHE, education";École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;education, education, education;CHE, CHE, CHE;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;8.029224;1.4335177

At the present, models of harmonic syntax face challenges on the tasks of detecting local and higher-level modulations (most previous models assume a priori knowledge of key), computing connected parse trees for long sequences, and parsing sequences that do not end with tonic chords, but in turnarounds. This paper addresses those problems by proposing a new generative formalism Probabilistic Abstract Context-Free Grammars (PACFGs) to address these issues, and presents variants of standard parsing algorithms that efficiently enumerate all possible parses of long chord sequences and to estimate their probabilities. PACFGs specifically allow for structured non-terminal symbols in rich and highly flexible feature spaces. The inference procedure moreover takes advantage of these abstractions by sharing probability mass between grammar rules over joint features. The paper presents a model of the harmonic syntax of Jazz using this formalism together with stochastic variational inference to learn the probabilistic parameters of a grammar from a corpus of Jazz-standards. The PACFG model outperforms the standard context-free approach while reducing the number of free parameters and performing key finding on the fly.;"Daniel Harasim, Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland, education, Institut für Kunst- und Musikwissenschaft, TU Dresden, Germany, education;Martin Rohrmeier, Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland, education, Institut für Kunst- und Musikwissenschaft, TU Dresden, Germany, education;Timothy J.

Specifically, two paradigms that harness information from unlabeled data, namely feature learning and student-teacher learning, are applied to two major types of ADT systems.

While most research in polyphonic instrument recognition focuses on predicting the predominant instruments in a given audio recording, instrument activity detection represents a generalized problem of detecting the presence or activity of instruments in a track on a fine-grained temporal scale. We present an approach for instrument activity detection in polyphonic music with temporal resolution ranging from one second to the track level.

We encode pages as strings of diatonic pitch intervals, ignoring rests, to reduce the effect of such errors. We extract indices comprising lists of two kinds of 'word'. Approximate matching is done by counting the number of common words between a query page and those in the collection. The two word-types are (a) normal ngrams and (b) minimal absent words (MAWs).

We approach the task from a classification perspective and adopt a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) architecture that relies on a particular form of pretraining by source-filter nonnegative matrix factorisation (NMF). The source-filter NMF decomposition is chosen for its ability to capture the pitch and timbre content of the leading voice/instrument, providing a better initial pitch salience than standard timefrequency representations. Starting from such a musically motivated representation, we propose to further enhance the NMF-based salience representations with CNN layers, then to model the temporal structure by an RNN network and to estimate the dominant melody with a final classification layer. The results show that such a system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MedleyDB dataset without any augmentation methods or large training sets.;"Dogac Basaran, CNRS, Ircam Lab, Sorbonne Université, Ministère de la Culture, FRA, facility, LTCI, Télécom ParisTech, Université Paris Saclay, FRA, education;Slim Essid, LTCI, Télécom ParisTech, Université Paris Saclay, FRA, education;Geoffroy Peeters, CNRS, Ircam Lab, Sorbonne Université, Ministère de la Culture, FRA, facility";IRCAM, Université Paris Saclay, IRCAM;facility, education, facility;FRA, FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;17.840567;-15.965776
"Tristan Carsault;Jerome Nika;Philippe Esling";Using Musical Relationships Between Chord Labels in Automatic Chord Extraction Tasks;2018;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1492329;Recent research on Automatic Chord Extraction (ACE) has focused on the improvement of models based on machine learning. However, most models still fail to take into account the prior knowledge underlying the labeling alphabets (chord labels). Furthermore, recent works have shown that ACE performances have reached a glass ceiling. Therefore, this prompts the need to focus on other aspects of the task, such as the introduction of musical knowledge in the representation, the improvement of the models towards more complex chord alphabets and the development of more adapted evaluation methods. In this paper, we propose to exploit specific properties and relationships between chord labels in order to improve the learning of statistical ACE models. Hence, we analyze the interdependence of the representations of chords and their associated distances, the precision of the chord alphabets, and the impact of performing alphabet reduction before or after training the model. Furthermore, we propose new training losses based on musical theory. We show that these improve the results of ACE systems based on Convolutional Neural Networks. By analyzing our results, we uncover a set of related insights on ACE tasks based on statistical models, and also formalize the musical meaning of some classification errors.;"Tristan Carsault, Ircam, CNRS, Sorbonne Université, UMR 9912 STMS, FRA, education;Jérôme Nika, Ircam, CNRS, Sorbonne Université, UMR 9912 STMS, FRA, education; L3i Lab, University of La Rochelle, FRA, education;Philippe Esling, Ircam, CNRS, Sorbonne Université, UMR 9912 STMS, FRA, education";IRCAM,IRCAM, University of La Rochelle, IRCAM;facility, facility, education, facility;FRA, FRA, FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;27.08616;-53.742912

First, we introduce DALI, a large and rich multimodal dataset containing 5358 audio tracks with their time-aligned vocal melody notes and lyrics at four levels of granularity. The second goal is to explain our methodology where dataset creation and learning models interact using a teacher-student machine learning paradigm that benefits each other. We start with a set of manual annotations of draft time-aligned lyrics and notes made by non-expert users of Karaoke games. This set comes without audio. Therefore, we need to find the corresponding audio and adapt the annotations to it. To that end, we retrieve audio candidates from the Web. Each candidate is then turned into a singing-voice probability over time using a teacher, a deep convolutional neural network singing-voice detection system (SVD), trained on cleaned data. Comparing the time-aligned lyrics and the singing-voice probability, we detect matches and update the time-alignment lyrics accordingly. From this, we obtain new audio sets. They are then used to train new SVD students used to perform again the above comparison. The process could be repeated iteratively. We show that this allows to progressively improve the performances of our SVD and get better audiomatching and alignment.;"Gabriel Meseguer-Brocal, Ircam Lab, CNRS, Sorbonne Université, Ministère de la Culture, FRA, facility;Alice Cohen-Hadria, Ircam Lab, CNRS, Sorbonne Université, Ministère de la Culture, FRA, facility;Geoffroy Peeters, Ircam Lab, CNRS, Sorbonne Université, Ministère de la Culture, FRA, facility";IRCAM,IRCAM,IRCAM;facility, facility, facility;FRA, FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-25.641493;-4.1832905

However, as the learning is unsupervised, the latent dimensions are not related to perceptual properties. In parallel, music perception research has aimed to understand timbre based on human dissimilarity ratings. These lead to timbre spaces which exhibit perceptual similarities between sounds. However, they do not generalize to novel examples and do not provide an invertible mapping, preventing audio synthesis. Here, we show that Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) can bridge these lines of research and alleviate their weaknesses by regularizing the latent spaces to match perceptual distances collected from timbre studies. Hence, we propose three types of regularization and show that they lead to spaces that are simultaneously coherent with signal properties and perceptual similarities. We show that these spaces can be used for efficient audio classification. We study how audio descriptors are organized along the latent dimensions and show that even though descriptors behave in a non-linear way across the space, they still exhibit a locally smooth evolution. We also show that, as this space generalizes to novel samples, it can be used to predict perceptual similarities of novel instruments. Finally, we exhibit the generative capabilities of our spaces, that can directly synthesize sounds with continuous evolution of timbre perception.;"Philippe Esling, Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique-Musique (IRCAM), CNRS - UMR 9912, UPMC - Sorbonne Universite, FRA, education;Axel Chemla–Romeu-Santos, Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique-Musique (IRCAM), CNRS - UMR 9912, UPMC - Sorbonne Universite, FRA, education;Adrien Bitton, Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique-Musique (IRCAM), CNRS - UMR 9912, UPMC - Sorbonne Universite, FRA, education";IRCAM,IRCAM,IRCAM;facility, facility, facility;FRA, FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;6.9681697;-16.726362

We define (i) on a global and a country level, (ii) by several network centrality measures such as Jaccard index among users' connections, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality, and (iii) by country and age information. Using the LFM-1b dataset of listening events of Last.fm users, we are able to uncover country-dependent differences in consumption of mainstream music as well as in user behavior with respect to social ties and users' centrality. We could identify that users inclined to mainstream music tend to have stronger connections than the group of less mainstreamy users. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that users typically have less connections within a country than cross-country ones, with the first being stronger social ties, though.

These modifications enable the network to learn a genre-independent model that performs better than models trained for specific music styles, which has not been the case in existing work. We analyse this generalisation capability on three datasets comprising distinct genres. We then evaluate the model on a number of unseen data sets, and show its superior performance compared to the state of the art. Finally, we investigate the model's performance on short excerpts of audio. From these experiments, we conclude that models need to consider the harmonic coherence of the whole piece when classifying the local key of short segments of audio.;"Filip Korzeniowski, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria, education;Gerhard Widmer, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria, education";Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University;education, education;AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-5.3179765;33.087025
"Filip Korzeniowski;Gerhard Widmer";Improved Chord Recognition by Combining Duration and Harmonic Language Models;2018;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1492335;Chord recognition systems typically comprise an acoustic model that predicts chords for each audio frame, and a temporal model that casts these predictions into labelled chord segments. However, temporal models have been shown to only smooth predictions, without being able to incorporate musical information about chord progressions. Recent research discovered that it might be the low hierarchical level such models have been applied to (directly on audio frames) which prevents learning musical relationships, even for expressive models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, if applied on the level of chord sequences, RNNs indeed can become powerful chord predictors. In this paper, we disentangle temporal models into a harmonic language model—to be applied on chord sequences—and a chord duration model that connects the chord-level predictions of the language model to the frame-level predictions of the acoustic model. In our experiments, we explore the impact of each model on the chord recognition score, and show that using harmonic language and duration models improves the results.;"Filip Korzeniowski, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria, education;Gerhard Widmer, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria, education";Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University;education, education;AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;29.28552;-55.2893

In this paper, we apply novel transposition-invariant audio features to this task. These low-dimensional features represent local pitch intervals and are learned in an unsupervised fashion by a gated autoencoder. Our results show that the proposed features are indeed fully transposition-invariant and enable accurate alignments between transposed scores and performances. Furthermore, they can even outperform widely used features for audio-to-score alignment on 'untransposed data', and thus are a viable and more flexible alternative to well-established features for music alignment and matching.;"Andreas Arzt, Johannes Kepler University, AUT, education;Stefan Lattner, Johannes Kepler University, AUT, education, Sony Computer Science Laboratories (CSL), FRA, company";Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University;education, education;AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;28.986164;12.24082

We start this paper by formulating score following as a multimodal Markov Decision Process, the mathematical foundation for sequential decision making. Given this formal definition, we address the score following task with state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms such as synchronous advantage actor critic (A2C). In particular, we design multimodal RL agents that simultaneously learn to listen to music, read the scores from images of sheet music, and follow the audio along in the sheet, in an end-to-end fashion. All this behavior is learned entirely from scratch, based on a weak and potentially delayed reward signal that indicates to the agent how close it is to the correct position in the score. Besides discussing the theoretical advantages of this learning paradigm, we show in experiments that it is in fact superior compared to previously proposed methods for score following in raw sheet music images.;"Matthias Dorfer, Johannes Kepler University Linz, AUT, education, The Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI), AUT, facility;Florian Henkel, Johannes Kepler University Linz, AUT, education, The Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI), AUT, facility;Gerhard Widmer, Johannes Kepler University Linz, AUT, education, The Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI), AUT, facility";Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University;education, education, education;AUT, AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-16.507442;-39.805267
"Stefan Lattner;Maarten Grachten;Gerhard Widmer";A Predictive Model for Music based on Learned Interval Representations;2018;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1492331;Connectionist sequence models (e.g., RNNs) applied to musical sequences suffer from two known problems: First, they have strictly absolute pitch perception. Therefore, they fail to generalize over musical concepts which are commonly perceived in terms of relative distances between pitches (e.g., melodies, scale types, modes, cadences, or chord types). Second, they fall short of capturing the concepts of repetition and musical form. In this paper we introduce the recurrent gated autoencoder (RGAE), a recurrent neural network which learns and operates on interval representations of musical sequences. The relative pitch modeling increases generalization and reduces sparsity in the input data. Furthermore, it can learn sequences of copy-and-shift operations (i.e. chromatically transposed copies of musical fragments)—a promising capability for learning musical repetition structure. We show that the RGAE improves the state of the art for general connectionist sequence models in learning to predict monophonic melodies, and that ensembles of relative and absolute music processing models improve the results appreciably. Furthermore, we show that the relative pitch processing of the RGAE naturally facilitates the learning and the generation of sequences of copy-and-shift operations, wherefore the RGAE greatly outperforms a common absolute pitch recurrent neural network on this task.;"Stefan Lattner, Institute of Computational Perception, JKU Linz, AUT, education, Sony Computer Science Laboratories (CSL), Paris, FRA, company;Maarten Grachten, Institute of Computational Perception, JKU Linz, AUT, education, Sony Computer Science Laboratories (CSL), Paris, FRA, company;Gerhard Widmer, Institute of Computational Perception, JKU Linz, AUT, education";Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University;education, education, education;AUT, AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;3.4980433;-9.389929

Therefore, when computer models are employed in music tasks, it can be useful to operate on interval representations rather than on the raw musical surface. Moreover, interval representations are transposition-invariant, valuable for tasks like audio alignment, cover song detection and music structure analysis. We employ a gated autoencoder to learn fixed-length, invertible and transposition-invariant interval representations from polyphonic music in the symbolic domain and in audio. An unsupervised training method is proposed yielding an organization of intervals in the representation space which is musically plausible.

"Anna Aljanaki;Mohammad Soleymani";A Data-driven Approach to Mid-level Perceptual Musical Feature Modeling;2018;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1492491;Musical features and descriptors could be coarsely divided into three levels of complexity. The bottom level contains the basic building blocks of music, e.g., chords, beats and timbre. The middle level contains concepts that emerge from combining the basic blocks: tonal and rhythmic stability, harmonic and rhythmic complexity, etc. High-level descriptors (genre, mood, expressive style) are usually modeled using the lower level ones. The features belonging to the middle level can both improve automatic recognition of high-level descriptors, and provide new music retrieval possibilities. Mid-level features are subjective and usually lack clear definitions. However, they are very important for human perception of music, and on some of them people can reach high agreement, even though defining them and therefore, designing a hand-crafted feature extractor for them can be difficult. In this paper, we derive the mid-level descriptors from data. We collect and release a dataset 1 of 5000 songs annotated by musicians with seven mid-level descriptors, namely, melodiousness, tonal and rhythmic stability, modality, rhythmic complexity, dissonance and articulation. We then compare several approaches to predicting these descriptors from spectrograms using deep-learning.

We experiment with different network architectures, varying the number and size of the hidden layers, and with dropout. We integrate two voice entry estimation heuristics that estimate the entry points of the individual voices in the polyphonic fabric into the models. These heuristics serve to reduce error propagation at the beginning of a piece, which, as we have shown in previous work, can seriously hamper model performance. The models are evaluated on the 48 fugues from Johann Sebastian Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier and his 30 inventions—a dataset that we curated and make publicly available. We find that a model with two hidden layers yields the best results. Using more layers does not lead to a significant performance improvement. Furthermore, we find that our voice entry estimation heuristics are highly effective in the reduction of error propagation, improving performance significantly.

Previous work addressed the problem by estimating note intensity using a polyphonic note model. However, they are limited because the note intensity is vulnerable to various factors in a recording environment. In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate the key velocity focusing on timbre change which is another cue associated with the key velocity. To this end, we separate individual notes of polyphonic piano music using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and feed them into a neural network that is trained to discriminate the timbre change according to the key velocity. Combining the note intensity from the separated notes with the statistics of the neural network prediction, the proposed method estimates the key velocity in the dimension of MIDI note velocity.

The harmonic functions (syntactic roles) and repetitive structure of chords are learned by the PCFG.

There are, however, many potential pitfalls, especially in early music, where scores are edited in different ways: variables include clefs, note values, types of barline, and editorial accidentals. Different score editors and optical music recognition software have their own ways of storing and exporting musical data. Choice of software and file formats, and their various parameters, can thus unintentionally bias data, as can decisions on how to interpret potentially ambiguous markings in original sources. This becomes especially problematic when data from different corpora are combined for computational processing, since observed regularities and irregularities may in fact be linked with inconsistent corpus collection methodologies, internal and external, rather than the underlying music. This paper proposes guidelines, templates, and workflows for the creation of consistent early music corpora, and for detecting encoding biases in existing corpora.

We then present a novel approach to computational harmonic analysis: rather than computing harmonic analyses based on one specific set of rules, we compute all possible analyses which satisfy only basic, uncontroversial constraints. These myriad interpretations can later be filtered to extract preferred analyses; for instance, to forbid 7th chords or to prefer analyses with fewer non-chord tones. We apply this approach to two concrete musical datasets: existing encodings of 371 chorales by J.S. Bach and new encodings of 200 chorales by M. Prætorius. Through an online API users can filter and download numerous harmonic interpretations of these 571 chorales.

Even if she does not input such information, it has been reported that user attributes can be predicted with high accuracy by using her play log. How can users enjoy music when using an online music service while preserving their demographic anonymity? To solve this problem, we propose a system called Listener Anonymizer. Listener Anonymizer monitors the user's play log. When it detects that her confidential attributes can be predicted, it selects songs that can decrease the prediction accuracy and recommends them to her. The user can camouflage her play logs by playing these songs to preserve her demographic anonymity.

"Tian Cheng;Satoru Fukayama;Masataka Goto";Comparing RNN Parameters for Melodic Similarity;2018;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1492529;Melodic similarity is an important task in the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) domain, with promising applications including query by example, music recommendation and visualisation. Most current approaches compute the similarity between two melodic sequences by comparing their local features (distance between pitches, intervals, etc.) or by comparing the sequences after aligning them. In order to find a better feature representing global characteristics of a melody, we propose to represent the melodic sequence of each musical piece by the parameters of a generative Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on its sequence. Because the trained RNN can generate the identical melodic sequence of each piece, we can expect that the RNN parameters contain the temporal information within the melody. In our experiment, we first train an RNN on all melodic sequences, and then use it as an initialisation to train an individual RNN on each melodic sequence. The similarity between two melodies is computed by using the distance between their individual RNN parameters. Experimental results showed that the proposed RNN-based similarity outperformed the baseline similarity obtained by directly comparing melodic sequences.;"Tian Cheng, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility;Satoru Fukayama, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;facility, facility, facility;JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-17.034172;-2.5954418

However, it is time-consuming for curators to timely rearrange these playlists for fitting trends in future. By exploiting the techniques of deep learning and reinforcement learning, in this paper, we consider music playlist generation as a language modeling problem and solve it by the proposed attention language model with policy gradient. We develop a systematic and interactive approach so that the resulting playlists can be tuned flexibly according to user preferences. Considering a playlist as a sequence of words, we first train our attention RNN language model on baseline recommended playlists. By optimizing suitable imposed reward functions, the model is thus refined for corresponding preferences. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only generates coherent playlists automatically but is also able to flexibly recommend personalized playlists for diversity, novelty and freshness.;"Shun-Yao Shih, National Taiwan University, TWN, education;Heng-Yu Chi, KKBOX Inc., Taipei, TWN, company";National Taiwan University, KKBOX Inc.;education, company;TWN, TWN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;-57.48705;26.707788

The proposed method transcribes and aligns lyrics to solo-singing vocals using the imperfect transcripts from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system and the published lyrics. The ASR provides time alignment between vocals and hypothesized lyrical content, while the non-aligned published lyrics correct the hypothesized lyrical content. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through three experiments. First, a human listening test shows that 73.32% of our automatically aligned sentence-level transcriptions are correct. Second, the automatically aligned sung segments are used for singing acoustic model adaptation, which reduces the word error rate (WER) of automatic transcription of sung lyrics from 72.08% to 37.15% in an open test. Third, another iteration of decoding and model adaptation increases the amount of reliably decoded segments from 44.40% to 91.96% and further reduces the WER to 36.32%. The proposed framework offers an automatic way to generate reliable alignments between lyrics and solosinging.

This work explores the importance of four cognitive decision-making factors (familiarity, genre preference, ease of vocal reproducibility, and overall preference) influence in the perception of singability, how attractive a song is to sing. In Experiment One, we develop a model to validate and empirically determine to what degree these factors are important when evaluating its singability. Results indicate that evaluations of how these four factors impact singability strongly correlate with pairwise evaluations (ρ = 0.692, p &lt; 0.0001), supporting the notion that singability is a measurable cognitive process. Experiment Two examines the degree to which timbral and rhythmic features contribute to singability.

However, finding discriminative features in an unsupervised way is challenging and supervised feature learning using semantic labels may involve noisy or expensive annotation. In this paper, we present a supervised feature learning approach using artist labels annotated in every single track as objective meta data. We propose two deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) to learn the deep artist features. One is a plain DCNN trained with the whole artist labels simultaneously, and the other is a Siamese DCNN trained with a subset of the artist labels based on the artist identity. We apply the trained models to music classification and retrieval tasks in transfer learning settings. The results show that our approach is comparable to previous state-of-the-art methods, indicating that the proposed approach captures general music audio features as much as the models learned with semantic labels.

We use this model to investigate one aspect of instantaneous consonance (harmonicity) and two aspects of sequential consonance (spectral distance and voice-leading distance). Applied to our three musical genres, the results generally support the relationship between sensory consonance and harmony, but lead us to question the high importance attributed to spectral distance in the psychological literature.

We demonstrate this method for a state-of-the-art singing voice detection model. We train up-convolutional neural networks to invert the feature generated at each layer of the model. The results suggest that the deepest fully connected layer of the model does not preserve temporal and harmonic structures, but that the inverted features from the deepest convolutional layer do. Moreover, a qualitative analysis of a large number of inputs suggests that the deepest layer in the model learns a decision function as the information it preserves depends on the class label associated with an input.;"Saumitra Mishra, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Bob L.

Therefore, we investigate end-to-end source separation in the time-domain, which allows modelling phase information and avoids fixed spectral transformations. Due to high sampling rates for audio, employing a long temporal input context on the sample level is difficult, but required for high quality separation results because of long-range temporal correlations. In this context, we propose the Wave-U-Net, an adaptation of the U-Net to the one-dimensional time domain, which repeatedly resamples feature maps to compute and combine features at different time scales. We introduce further architectural improvements, including an output layer that enforces source additivity, an upsampling technique and a context-aware prediction framework to reduce output artifacts. Experiments for singing voice separation indicate that our architecture yields a performance comparable to a stateof-the-art spectrogram-based U-Net architecture, given the same data.

The stationary points (STAs) of transients – points where the pitch curve changes direction – also carry melody information. In this paper, the precision of sung notes in Carnatic music is studied in detail by treating CPNs and STAs separately. There is variation among the nineteen musicians considered, but on average, the precision of CPNs increases exponentially with duration and settles at about 10 cents for CPNs longer than 0.5 seconds. For analyzing STAs, in contrast to Western music, r¯aga (melody) information is found to be necessary, and errors in STAs show a significantly larger standard deviation of about 60 cents. To corroborate these observations, the music was automatically transcribed and re-synthesized using CPN and STA information using two interpolation techniques. The results of perceptual tests clearly indicate that the grammar is highly flexible.

Using this confidence measure, musical tracks which are likely to be misclassified, i.e. those with low confidence, can then be handled differently from those analysed by standard, fully automatic key detection methods. By means of a listening test, we demonstrate that our developed features significantly correlate with listeners' ratings of harmonic complexity, steadiness and the uniqueness of key. Furthermore, we demonstrate that tracks which are incorrectly labelled using an existing key detection system obtain low confidence values.

We find that temporal granularity has a significant impact on performance, and we analyze its interaction with the encoding of the networks outputs.;"Magdalena Fuentes, L2S, CNRS-Univ.Paris-Sud-CentraleSupélec, France, education, LTCI, Télécom ParisTech, Univ.

Language models come in many shapes and sizes, but their central purpose is always the same: to predict the next event in a sequence of letters, words, notes, or chords. However, few studies employing such models have evaluated the most stateof-the-art architectures using a large-scale corpus of Western tonal music, instead preferring to use relatively small datasets containing chord annotations from contemporary genres like jazz, pop, and rock. Using symbolic representations of prominent instrumental genres from the common-practice period, this study applies a flexible, data-driven encoding scheme to (1) evaluate Finite Context (or n-gram) models and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in a chord prediction task; (2) compare predictive accuracy from the best-performing models for chord onsets from each of the selected datasets; and (3) explain differences between the two model architectures in a regression analysis. We find that Finite Context models using the Prediction by Partial Match (PPM) algorithm outperform RNNs, particularly for the piano datasets, with the regression model suggesting that RNNs struggle with particularly rare chord types.";"David R.

While many algorithms for MIR rely on assessing feature subsequences, the user normally has no resources to interpret the significance of these patterns. Interpreting the relations between these temporal patterns and some aspects of the assessed songs can help understanding not only some algorithms' outcomes but the kind of patterns which better defines a set of similarly labeled recordings. In this work, we present a novel method to assess these relations, constructing an association rule network from temporal patterns obtained by a simple quantization process. With an empirical evaluation, we illustrate how we can use our method to explore these relations in a varied set of data and labels.;"Renan de Padua, Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação – Universidade de São Paulo, BRA, education, Data Science Team, Itaú-Unibanco, BRA, company;Verônica Oliveira de Carvalho, Instituto de Geociências e Ciências Exatas – Universidade Estadual Paulista, BRA, education;Solange de Oliveira Rezende, Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação – Universidade de São Paulo, BRA, education;Diego Furtado Silva, Departamento de Computação – Universidade Federal de São Carlos, BRA, education";Universidade de São Paulo, Universidade Estadual Paulista, Universidade de São Paulo, Universidade Federal de São Carlos;education, education, education, education;BRA, BRA, BRA, BRA;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;-9.311486;21.572393

At the same, the recent growth of digital music repositories makes necessary the development of novel timeand memory-efficient algorithms to deal with music data. One particularly interesting idea on the literature is transforming the music data into reduced representations, improving the memory usage and reducing the time necessary to assess the similarity. However, these techniques usually add other issues, such as an expensive preprocessing or a reduced retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method to summarize a recording in small snippets based on its self-similarity information. Besides, we present a simple way to compare other recordings to these summaries. We demonstrate, in the scenario of cover song identification, that our method is more than one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art adversaries, at the same time that the retrieval performance is not affected significantly. Additionally, our method is incremental, which allows the easy and fast update of the database when a new song needs to be inserted into the retrieval system.;"Diego Furtado Silva, Universidade Federal de São Carlos, BRA, education;Felipe Vieira Falcão, Universidade Federal de Campina Grande, BRA, education;Nazareno Andrade, Universidade Federal de Campina Grande, BRA, education";Universidade Federal de São Carlos, Universidade Federal de Campina Grande, Universidade Federal de Campina Grande;education, education, education;BRA, BRA, BRA;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;14.4262905;44.75562

To this end, the musical preferences of users in the context of music recommender systems have mostly been captured in collaborative filtering-based approaches. Alternatively, users can be characterized by their average listening behavior and hence, by the mean values of a set of content descriptors of tracks the users listened to. However, a user may listen to highly different tracks and genres. Thus, computing the average of all tracks does not capture the user's listening behavior well. We argue that each user may have many different preferences that depend on contextual aspects (e.g., listening to classical music when working and hard rock when doing sports) and that user models should account for these different sets of preferences. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis and evaluation of different user models that describe a user's musical preferences based on acoustic features of tracks the user has listened to.;"Eva Zangerle, Universität Innsbruck, AUT, education;Martin Pichl, Universität Innsbruck, AUT, education";University of Innsbruck,University of Innsbruck;education, education;AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-33.943844;30.656355

Among its many uses, an interesting scenario is that in which a score captured with a camera is to be automatically reproduced. Recent approaches to OMR have shown that the use of deep neural networks allows important advances in the field. However, these approaches have been evaluated on images with ideal conditions, which do not correspond to the previous scenario. In this work, we evaluate the performance of an end-to-end approach that uses a deep convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) over non-ideal image conditions of music scores. Consequently, our contribution also consists of Camera-PrIMuS, a corpus of printed monophonic scores of real music synthetically modified to resemble camera-based realistic scenarios, involving distortions such as irregular lighting, rotations, or blurring.

We formalize and discuss the significance of 44 cadential features, correlated with the occurrence of cadences in scores. These features describe properties at the arrival beat of a cadence and its surroundings, but also at other onsets heuristically identified to pinpoint chords preparing the cadence. The representation of each beat of the score as a vector of cadential features makes it possible to reformulate cadence detection as a classification task. An SVM classifier was run on two corpora from Bach and Haydn totaling 162 perfect authentic cadences and 70 half cadences. In these corpora, the classifier correctly identified more than 75% of perfect authentic cadences and 50% of half cadences, with low false positive rates. The experiment results are consistent with common knowledge that classification is more complex for half cadences than for authentic cadences.;"Louis Bigo, CRIStAL, UMR 9189, CNRS, Université de Lille, FRA, education;Laurent Feisthauer, CRIStAL, UMR 9189, CNRS, Université de Lille, FRA, education;Mathieu Giraud, CRIStAL, UMR 9189, CNRS, Université de Lille, FRA, education;Florence Levé, MIS, Université de Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens, FRA, education";Université de Lille, Université de Lille,Université de Lille,Université de Lille;education, education, education, education;FRA, FRA, FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;22.248959;8.363579

Among them, Poisson matrix factorization (PMF) has raised a lot of interest, since it seems well-suited to the implicit data provided by listening counts. Additionally, it has proven to achieve state-ofthe-art performance while being scalable to big data. Yet, CF suffers from a critical issue, usually called cold-start problem: the system cannot recommend new songs, i.e., songs which have never been listened to. To alleviate this, one should complement the listening counts with another modality. This paper proposes a multi-modal extension of PMF applied to listening counts and tag labels extracted from the Million Song Dataset. In our model, every song is represented by the same activation pattern in each modality but with possibly different scales. As such, the method is not prone to the cold-start problem, i.e., it can learn from a single modality when the other one is not informative. Our model is symmetric (it equally uses both modalities) and we evaluate it on two tasks: new songs recommendation and tag labeling.;"Olivier Gouvert, IRIT, Université de Toulouse, CNRS, France, education;Thomas Oberlin, IRIT, Université de Toulouse, CNRS, France, education;Cédric Févotte, IRIT, Université de Toulouse, CNRS, France, education";Université de Toulouse, Université de Toulouse, Université de Toulouse;education, education, education;FRA, FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-47.405655;40.104454

The current state of the art considers the use of deep neural networks trained to classify every pixel of the image according to the image layer it belongs to.

In this paper, we propose the use of a set of deep selectional auto-encoders, implemented as fully-convolutional networks, to perform image-to-image categorizations. This strategy retains the advantages of using deep neural networks, which have demonstrated their ability to perform this task, while dramatically increasing the efficiency by processing a large number of pixels in a single step. The results of an experiment performed with a set of high-resolution images taken from Medieval manuscripts successfully validate this approach, with a similar accuracy to that of the state of the art but with a computational time orders of magnitude smaller, making this approach appropriate for being used in interactive applications.;"Francisco J.

The proposed method is based on a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network architecture directly trained with pairs of spectrograms and their corresponding symbolic scores in Western notation. Unlike standard pitch estimation methods, the proposed architecture does not need the music symbols to be aligned with their audio frames thanks to a Connectionist Temporal Classification loss function. Training and evaluation were performed using a large dataset of short monophonic scores (incipits) from the RISM collection, that were synthesized to get the ground-truth data. Although there is still room for improvement, most musical symbols were correctly detected and the evaluation results validate the proposed approach.

The synergy between Renaissance music and poetry makes madrigals of great value to musicologists, linguists, and historians—thus, it is a promising repertoire for computational musicology. However, the application of computational techniques for automatic detection of madrigalisms within scores of such repertoire is limited by the lack of annotations to refer to.

The intersection of this data showed an unbalanced representation of the eight musical concepts.

Prior work has focused on multiple fundamental frequency estimation (multi-pitch detection), the conversion of an audio signal into a timefrequency representation such as a MIDI file. It is less common to annotate this output with musical features such as voicing information, metrical structure, and harmonic information, though these are important aspects of a complete transcription. Evaluation of these features is most often performed separately and independent of multi-pitch detection; however, these features are non-independent. We therefore introduce M V 2H, a quantitative, automatic, joint evaluation metric based on musicological principles, and show its effectiveness through the use of specific examples. The metric is modularised in such a way that it can still be used with partially performed annotation— for example, when the transcription process has been applied to some transduced format such as MIDI (which may itself be the result of multi-pitch detection).

Emotion-aware music information retrieval (MIR) has been difficult due to the subjectivity and temporality of emotion responses to music. Physiological signals are regarded as related to emotion and thus could potentially be exploited in emotion-aware music discovery. This study explored the possibility of using physiological signals to detect users' emotion responses to music, with consideration of individual characteristics (personality, music preferences, etc.). A user experiment was conducted with 23 participants who searched for music in a novel MIR system. Users' listening behaviors and self-reported emotion responses to a total of 628 music pieces were collected. During music listening, a series of peripheral physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance) were recorded from participants unobtrusively using a researchgrade wearable wristband. A set of features in the timeand frequencydomains were extracted from the physiological signals and analyzed using statistical and machine learning methods. Results reveal 1) significant differences in some physiological features between positive and negative arousal and mood categories, and 2) effective classification of emotion responses based on physiological signals for some individuals.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the building blocks of a future 'gesture-based' melody retrieval system. We present a dataset containing 16 melodic phrases from four musical styles and with a large range of contour variability. This is accompanied by full-body motion capture data of 26 participants performing sound-tracing to the melodies. The dataset is analyzed using canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and its neural network variant (Deep CCA), to understand how melodic contours and sound tracings relate to each other. The analyses reveal non-linear relationships between sound and motion. The link between pitch and verticality does not appear strong enough for complex melodies. We also find that descending melodic contours have the least correlation with tracings.;"Tejaswinee Kelkar, University of Oslo, NOR, education;Udit Roy, ;Alexander Refsum Jensenius, University of Oslo, NOR, education";University of Oslo,unknown, University of Oslo;education, unknown, education;NOR, unknown, NOR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-16.011667;-6.4829335
"André Ofner;Sebastian Stober";Shared Generative Representation of Auditory Concepts and EEG to Reconstruct Perceived and Imagined Music;2018;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1492433;Retrieving music information from brain activity is a challenging and still largely unexplored research problem. In this paper we investigate the possibility to reconstruct perceived and imagined musical stimuli from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings based on two datasets. One dataset contains multichannel EEG of subjects listening to and imagining rhythmical patterns presented both as sine wave tones and short looped spoken utterances. These utterances leverage the well-known speech-to-song illusory transformation which results in very catchy and easy to reproduce motifs. A second dataset provides EEG recordings for the perception of 10 full length songs. Using a multi-view deep generative model we demonstrate the feasibility of learning a shared latent representation of brain activity and auditory concepts, such as rhythmical motifs appearing across different instrumentations. Introspection of the model trained on the rhythm dataset reveals disentangled rhythmical and timbral features within and across subjects. The model allows continuous interpolation between representations of different observed variants of the presented stimuli. By decoding the learned embeddings we were able to reconstruct both perceived and imagined music. Stimulus complexity and the choice of training data shows strong effect on the reconstruction quality.;"André Ofner, University of Potsdam, DEU, education;Sebastian Stober, University of Potsdam, DEU, education";University of Potsdam, University of Potsdam;education, education;DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-4.291132;19.465128

Existing approaches, however, are mostly ad hoc to specific rhythmic structures or instrumentation layouts, and lack music-theoretic rigor in their evaluations. In this paper, we present a neural language (music) model that tries to model symbolic multi-part music. Our model is part-invariant, i.e., it can process/generate any part (voice) of a music score consisting of an arbitrary number of parts, using a single trained model. For better incorporating structural information of pitch spaces, we use a structured embedding matrix to encode multiple aspects of a pitch into a vector representation. The generation is performed by Gibbs Sampling. Meanwhile, our model directly generates note spellings to make outputs human-readable. We performed objective (grading) and subjective (listening) evaluations by recruiting music theorists to compare the outputs of our algorithm with those of music students on the task of bassline harmonization (a traditional pedagogical task). Our experiment shows that errors of our algorithm and students are differently distributed, and the range of ratings for generated pieces overlaps with students' to varying extents for our three provided basslines. This experiment suggests some future research directions.;"Yujia Yan, University of Rochester, USA, education;Ethan Lustig, University of Rochester, USA, education;Joseph VanderStel, University of Rochester, USA, education;Zhiyao Duan, University of Rochester, USA, education";University of Rochester, University of Rochester, University of Rochester, University of Rochester;education, education, education, education;USA, USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;3.7053218;-21.569977

Previous work has established that music-induced mood can measurably alter people's behavior in different contexts. However, the nature of how decision-making is affected by music in social settings hasn't been sufficiently explored. The goal of this study is to examine which aspects of people's decision making in inter-social tasks are affected when exposed to music. For this purpose, we devised an experiment in which people drove a simulated car through an intersection while listening to music. The intersection was not empty, as another simulated vehicle, controlled autonomously, was also crossing the intersection in a different direction. Our results indicate that music indeed alters people's behavior with respect to this social task.

Instrumentation is a key factor in determining musical sound characteristics. For example, a musical piece performed with vocals, electric guitar, electric bass, and drums can generally be associated with pop/rock music but not with classical or electronic. Therefore, visualizing instrumentation can help listeners browse music more efficiently. Instrudive visualizes musical pieces by illustrating instrumentation with multi-colored pie charts and displays them on a map in accordance with the similarity in instrumentation. Users can utilize three functions. First, they can browse musical pieces on a map by referring to the visualized instrumentation. Second, they can interactively edit a playlist that showing the items to be played later. Finally, they can discern the temporal changes in instrumentation and skip to a preferable part of a piece with a multi-colored graph. The instruments are identified using a deep convolutional neural network that has four convolutional layers with different filter shapes.

One of these problems, known as the \textit{all-partition array problem}, is a particularly hard variant of set covering, and several different approaches, including mathematical optimization, constraint satisfaction, and greedy backtracking, have been proposed for solving it. Of these previous approaches, only constraint programming has led to a successful solution. Unfortunately, this solution is expensive in terms of computation time. We present here two new search heuristics and a modification to a previously proposed heuristic, that, when applied to a greedy backtracking algorithm, allow the all-partition array problem to be solved in a practical running time. We demonstrate the success of our heuristics by solving for three different instances of the problem found in Babbitt's music, including one previously solved with constraint programming and one Babbitt himself was unable to solve. Use of the new heuristics allows each instance of the problem to be solved more quickly than was possible with previous approaches.;"Brian Bemman, Aalborg University, DNK, education;David Meredith, Aalborg University, DNK, education";Aalborg University, Aalborg University;education, education;DNK, DNK;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;20.83847;17.379665
"Tsung-Ping Chen;Li Su";Harmony Transformer: Incorporating Chord Segmentation into Harmony Recognition;2019;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3527794;Musical harmony analysis is usually a process of unfolding and interpreting the hierarchical structure of music. Computational approaches to such structural analysis are still challenging, owing to the fact that the boundary between different harmonic states (such as chord functions) is not explicitly defined in the audio or symbolic music data. It is a novel approach to improve chord recognition by jointly identifying chord change using end-to-end sequence learning. In this paper, we propose the Harmony Transformer, a multi-task music harmony analysis model aiming to improve chord recognition through incorporating chord segmentation into the recognition process. The integration of chord segmentation and chord recognition is implemented with the Transformer, a deep sequential learning model yielding fruitful results in the field of natural language processing. A non-autoregressive decoding framework is also adopted here in aid of concatenating the two highly correlated tasks.

Methodologically, such movement cues have been treated as distinct, isolated events. Yet as practicing musicians and music pedagogues know, conductors' expressive instructions are highly flexible and dependent on the musical context. We seek to demonstrate an approach to search for effective descriptors to express musical features in conducting movement in a valid music context, and to extract complex expressive semantics from elementary conducting kinematic variations. This study therefore proposes a multi-task learning model to jointly identify dynamic, articulation, and phrasing cues from conducting kinematics. A professional conducting movement dataset is compiled using a high-resolution motion capture system. The ReliefF algorithm is applied to select significant features from conducting movement, and recurrent neural network (RNN) is implemented to identify multiple movement cues. The experimental results disclose key elements in conducting movement which communicate musical expressiveness; the results also highlight the advantage of multi-task learning in the complete musical context over single-task learning.

Invertible models unify both discriminative and generative aspects in one function, sharing one set of parameters. Introducing invertibility enables the practitioner to directly inspect what the discriminative model has learned, and exactly determine which inputs lead to which outputs. For the task of transcribing polyphonic audio into symbolic form, these models may be especially useful as they allow us to observe, for instance, to what extent the concept of single notes could be learned from a corpus of polyphonic music alone (which has been identified as a serious problem in recent research). This is an entirely new approach to audio transcription, which first of all necessitates some groundwork. In this paper, we begin by looking at the simplest possible invertible transcription model, and then thoroughly investigate its properties. Finally, we will take first steps towards a more sophisticated and capable version.

This is commonly addressed by defining some heuristic notion of pattern significance, and returning only the most significant patterns. This paper develops a method of pattern discovery that models human judgement of what constitutes a significant pattern by incorporating annotations of repeated patterns, avoiding the need to design heuristics. We take pattern discovery as a clustering task, where the input is a set of passages of monophonic music, represented as vectors of extracted features, and the output clusters correspond to discovered patterns. The human annotations are used to train a neural network to learn a low-dimensional embedding of the feature space that maps passages of music close together when they are occurrences of the same ground-truth pattern. The results of this approach match up with the annotations significantly better than the results of an approach using clustering without subspace learning.

However, this method is problematic due to the limited human ability to temporally align taps with audio cues for beats accurately. In order to create accurate beat annotations, it is therefore typically necessary to manually correct the recorded taps in a subsequent step, which is a cumbersome task. In this work we aim to automate this correction step by snapping the taps to close-by audio cues a strategy that is often used by beat tracking algorithms to refine their beat estimates. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. First, we formalize the automated correction procedure mathematically. Second, we introduce a novel visualization method that serves as a tool to analyze the results of the correction procedure for potential errors.

"Andreas Katsiavalos;Tom Collins;Bret Battey";An Initial Computational Model for Musical Schemata Theory;2019;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3527768;Musical schemata theory entails the classification of subphrase-length progressions in melodic, harmonic and metric feature-sets as named entities (e.g., `Romanesca', `Meyer', `Cadence', etc.), where a musical schema is characterized by factors such as music content and form, position and tonal function within phrase structure, and interrelation with other schemata. To examine and automate the task of musical schemata classification, we developed a novel musical schemata classifier. First, we tested methods for exact and approximate matching of user-defined schemata prototypes, to establish the notions of identity and similarity between composite music patterns. Next, we examined methods for schemata prototype extraction from collections of same-labelled annotated examples, performing training and testing sessions similar to supervised learning approaches. The performance of the above tasks was verified using the same annotated dataset of 40 keyboard sonata excerpts from pre-Classical and Classical periods. Our evaluation of the classifier sheds light on: (a)~ability to parse and interpret music information, (b)~similarity methods for composite music patterns, (c)~categorization methods for polyphonic music.;"Andreas Katsiavalos, Music, Technology and Innovation Research Centre, De Montfort University, UK, education;Tom Collins, Music, Science and Technology Research Cluster, Department of Music, University of York, UK, education; Music Artificial Intelligence Algorithms, Inc., Davis, CA, USA, company;Bret Battey, Music, Technology and Innovation Research Centre, De Montfort University, UK, education";De Montfort University, University of York, Music Artificial Intelligence Algorithms Inc., De Montfort University;education, education, company, education;GBR, GBR, USA, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-3.642478;6.324351

Yet, the propose solutions often rely on simplifications and fail to address the diversity and subjectivity of music genres. Accounting for these has, though, many benefits for aligning knowledge sources, integrating data and enriching musical items with tags. Here, we choose a new angle for the genre study by seeking to predict what would be the genres of musical items in a target tag system, knowing the genres assigned to them within source tag systems. We call this a translation task and identify three cases: 1) no common annotated corpus between source and target tag systems exists, 2) such a large corpus exists, 3) only few common annotations exist. We propose the related solutions: a knowledge-based translation modeled as taxonomy mapping, a statistical translation modeled with maximum likelihood logistic regression; a hybrid translation modeled with maximum a posteriori logistic regression with priors given by the knowledge-based translation. During evaluation, the solutions fit well the identified cases and the hybrid translation is systematically the most effective w.r.t. multilabel classification metrics. This is a first attempt to unify genre tag systems by leveraging both representation and interpretation diversity.";"Elena V.

For efficient comparison, cross-source navigation is essential, enabling to quickly jump back and forth between multiple sources without losing the current musical position. In practice, measures are first annotated by hand in the individual source images and then related to each other. Our approach automates this time-consuming and error-prone process with the help of deep learning. For this purpose, we train a neural network that automatically finds bounding boxes of all measures in images. A second network is trained to compute the similarity between two measures to determine if they have the same musical content and should, therefore, be linked for navigation. Sequences of outputs from the second network are matched using Dynamic Time Warping to provide the final proposal of measure relationships, so-called concordances. In addition to cross-source navigation, the results can be used to spot structural differences across the sources which are essential for editorial work, so that musicologists can focus more on analytical tasks.;"Simon Waloschek, Detmold University of Music, DEU, education;Aristotelis Hadjakos, Detmold University of Music, DEU, education;Alexander Pacha, TU Wien, AUT, education";Detmold University of Music, Detmold University of Music, Technische Universität Wien;education, education, education;DEU, DEU, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-15.482847;-36.4621
"Andrew Wiggins;Youngmoo Kim";Guitar Tablature Estimation with a Convolutional Neural Network;2019;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3527800;Guitar tablature is a popular notation guitarists use to learn and share music. As it stands, most tablatures are created by an experienced guitarist taking the time and effort to annotate a song. As the process is time consuming and requires expertise, we are interested in automating this task. Previous approaches to automatic tablature transcription break the problem into two steps: 1) polyphonic pitch estimation, followed by 2) tablature fingering arrangement. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we can jointly solve both steps by learning a mapping directly from audio data to tablature. The model can simultaneously leverage physical playability constraints and differences in string timbres implicit in the data to determine the actual fingerings being used by the guitarist. We propose TabCNN, a CNN for estimating guitar tablature from audio of a solo acoustic guitar performance. We train and test our network using microphone recordings from the GuitarSet dataset, and TabCNN outperforms a state-of-the-art multipitch estimation algorithm. We also introduce a set of metrics to evaluate guitar tablature estimation.;"Andrew Wiggins, Drexel University, USA, education;Youngmoo Kim, Drexel University, USA, education";Drexel University, Drexel University;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;37.945423;-42.71065
"Daniel Harasim;Timothy O'Donnell;Martin Rohrmeier";Harmonic Syntax in Time: Rhythm Improves Grammatical Models of Harmony;2019;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3527812;Music is hierarchically structured, both in how it is perceived by listeners and how it is composed. Such structure can be captured elegantly using probabilistic grammatical models similar to those used to study natural language. They address the complexity of the structure using abstract categories in a recursive formalism. Most existing grammatical models of musical structure focus on one single dimension of music--such as melody, harmony, or rhythm. While these grammar models often work well on short musical excerpts, accurate analysis of longer pieces requires taking into account the constraints from multiple domains of structure. The present paper proposes abstract product grammars--a formalism which integrates multiple dimensions of musical structure into a single grammatical model--along with efficient parsing and inference algorithms for this formalism. We use this model to study the combination of hierarchically-structured harmonic syntax and hierarchically-structured rhythmic information. The latter is modeled by a novel grammar of rhythm that is capable of expressing temporal regularities in musical phrases. It integrates grouping structure and meter. The combined model of harmony and rhythm outperforms both single-dimension models in computational experiments. All models are trained and evaluated on a treebank of hand-annotated Jazz standards.;"Daniel Harasim, Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland, education;Timothy J.

"Christoph Finkensiep;Richard Widdess;Martin Rohrmeier";Modelling the Syntax of North Indian Melodies with a Generalized Graph Grammar;2019;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3527844;Hierarchical models of music allow explanation of highly complex musical structure based on the general principle of recursive elaboration and a small set of orthogonal operations. Recent approaches to melodic elaboration have converged to a representation based on intervals, which allows the elaboration of pairs of notes. However, two problems remain: First, an interval-first representation obscures one-sided operations like neighbor notes. Second, while models of Western melody styles largely agree on step-wise operations such as neighbors and passing notes, larger intervals are either attributed to latent harmonic properties or left unexplained. This paper presents a grammar for melodies in North Indian raga music, showing not only that recursively applied neighbor and passing note operations underlie this style as well, but that larger intervals are generated as generalized neighbors, based on the tonal hierarchy of the underlying scale structure. The notion of a generalized neighbor is not restricted to ragas but can be transferred to other musical styles, opening new perspectives on latent structure behind melodies and music in general. The presented grammar is based on a graph representation that allows one to express elaborations on both notes and intervals, unifying and generalizing previous graphand tree-based approaches.;"Christoph Finkensiep, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, CHE, education;Richard Widdess, SOAS University of London, GBR, education;Martin Rohrmeier, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, CHE, education";École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, SOAS University of London, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;education, education, education;CHE, GBR, CHE;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-12.147504;-15.237784

We report on experiments using three datasets of monotimbral recordings covering different levels of timbral complexity: isolated notes, isolated melodies, and polyphonic pieces.

These microtiming variations dictate the rhythmic flow of a performed melody, and contribute, among other things, to the suitability of this music as an accompaniment to dancing. In the context of Shetland fiddle music, these microtiming variations are often referred to as lilt. Using a corpus of 27 traditional fiddle tunes from the Shetland Isles, we examine inter-beat timing deviations, as well as inter-onset timing deviations of eighth note sequences. Results show a number of distinct inter-beat and inter-onset rhythmic patterns that may characterize lilt, as well as idiosyncratic patterns for each performer.

This problem hinders the practical usages of audio recognition systems. The difficulty mainly lies in the intrinsic long-tail distribution of chord qualities, and most chord qualities have too few samples for model training. In this paper, we propose a new model for audio chord recognition under a huge chord vocabulary. The core concept is to decompose any chord label into a set of musically meaningful components (e.g., triad, bass, seventh), each with a much smaller vocabulary compared to the size of the overall chord vocabulary. A multitask classifier is then trained to recognize all the components given the audio feature, and then labels of individual components are reassembled to form the final chord label. Experiments show that the proposed system not only achieves state-of-the-art results on traditional evaluation metrics but also performs well on a large vocabulary.;"Junyan Jiang, Fudan University, CHN, education, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education, Carnegie Mellon University, USA, education;Ke Chen, Fudan University, CHN, education, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education;Wei Li, Fudan University, CHN, education;Gus Xia, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education";Fudan University, Fudan University, Fudan University, New York University Shanghai;education, education, education, education;CHN, CHN, CHN, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;28.869205;-50.257515

However, despite the productive work of a small niche of humanities-trained computational musicologists, most cutting-edge digital music research is pursued by scholars whose primary training is scientific or computational, not humanistic. This unfortunate situation is prolonged, at least in part, by the daunting barrier that computer coding presents to humanities scholars with no technical training. In this paper, we present humdrumR (hum-drummer), a software package designed to afford computational musicology research for both advanced and novice computer coders. Humdrum is a powerful and influential existing computational musicology framework, including the humdrum syntax—a flexible text data format with tens of thousands of extant scores available (Kern Scores)—and the Bash-based humdrum toolkit. HumdrumR is a modern replacement for the humdrum toolkit, based in the data-analysis/statistical programming language R. By combining the flexibility and transparency of the humdrum syntax with the powerful data analysis tools and concise syntax of R, humdrumR offers an appealing new approach to would-be computational musicologists.

The most relevant features are identified by Principal Component Analysis and forward feature selection.

We investigate this task from an interactive music creation perspective. To this end, a novel deep learning-based approach for musical score inpainting is proposed. The designed model takes both past and future musical context into account and is capable of suggesting ways to connect them in a musically meaningful manner. To achieve this, we leverage the representational power of the latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder and train a Recurrent Neural Network which learns to traverse this latent space conditioned on the past and future musical contexts. Consequently, the designed model is capable of generating several measures of music to connect two musical excerpts. The capabilities and performance of the model are showcased by comparison with competitive baselines using several objective and subjective evaluation methods. The results show that the model generates meaningful inpaintings and can be used in interactive music creation applications.

Datasets for polyphonic instrument recognition can be categorized into roughly two categories. Some, such as MedleyDB, have strong per-frame instrument activity annotations but are usually small in size. Other, larger datasets such as OpenMIC only have weak labels, i.e., instrument presence or absence is annotated only for long snippets of a song. We explore an attention mechanism for handling weakly labeled data for multi-label instrument recognition. Attention has been found to perform well for other tasks with weakly labeled data. We compare the proposed attention model to multiple models which include a baseline binary relevance random forest, recurrent neural network, and fully connected neural networks. Our results show that incorporating attention leads to an overall improvement in classification accuracy metrics across all 20 instruments in the OpenMIC dataset.

We also reduced the model download size to approximately 400KB through post-training weight quantization. We calibrated a speed test based on partial model evaluation time to determine if the harmonization request should be performed locally or sent to remote TPU servers.

While audio-sheet music retrieval has been explored by a number of works, this scenario is novel in that the query is a cell phone picture rather than a digital scan. To solve this problem, we introduce a mid-level feature representation called a bootleg score which explicitly encodes the rules of Western musical notation. We convert both the MIDI and the sheet music into bootleg scores using deterministic rules of music and classical computer vision techniques for detecting simple geometric shapes. Once the MIDI and cell phone image have been converted into bootleg scores, we estimate the alignment using dynamic programming.

Rather than using optical music recognition to bridge the gap between sheet music and MIDI, we explore an alternative approach: projecting the MIDI data into pixel space and performing alignment in the image domain. Our method converts the MIDI data into a crude representation of the score that only contains rectangular floating notehead blobs, a process we call bootleg score synthesis. Furthermore, we project sheet music images into the same bootleg space by applying a deep watershed notehead detector and filling in the bounding boxes around each detected notehead. Finally, we align the bootleg representations using a simple variant of dynamic time warping. On a dataset of 68 real scanned piano scores from IMSLP and corresponding MIDI performances, our method achieves a 97.3% accuracy at an error tolerance of one second, outperforming several baseline systems that employ optical music recognition.;"Thitaree Tanprasert, Harvey Mudd College, USA, education;Teerapat Jenrungrot, Harvey Mudd College, USA, education;Meinard Müller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility;TJ Tsai, Harvey Mudd College, USA, education";Harvey Mudd College, Harvey Mudd College, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Harvey Mudd College;education, education, facility, education;USA, USA, DEU, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-13.151377;-33.542946

By comparing the Billboard Hot 100 with random samples, we find that the complexity of popular songs tends to be more narrowly distributed around the mean, supporting the idea of an inverted U-shaped relationship between complexity and hedonistic value. We then examine the temporal evolution of complexity, reporting consistent changes across decades, such as a decrease in average loudness complexity since the 1960s, and an increase in timbre complexity overall but not for popular songs. We also show, in contrast to claims that popular songs sound more alike over time, that they are not more similar than they were 50 years ago in terms of pitch or rhythm, although similarity in timbre shows distinctive patterns across eras and similarity in loudness has been increasing. Finally, we show that musical genres can be differentiated by their distinctive complexity profiles.;"Thomas Parmer, Indiana University, USA, education;Yong-Yeol Ahn, Indiana University, USA, education";Indiana University Bloomington, Indiana University Bloomington;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-10.455745;2.395658

In this paper, we analyze intonation deficiencies by introducing an intonation cost measure that can be computed from choir recordings and may help to assess the singers' intonation quality. With our approach, we measure the deviation between the recording's local salient frequency content and an adaptive reference grid based on the equal-tempered scale. The adaptivity introduces invariance of the local intonation measure to global intonation drifts. In our experiments, we compute this measure for several recordings of Anton Bruckner's choir piece Locus Iste. We demonstrate the robustness of the proposed measure by comparing scenarios of different complexity regarding the availability of aligned scores and multi-track recordings, as well as the number of singers per part. Even without using score information, our cost measure shows interesting trends, thus indicating the potential of our method for real-world applications.;"Christof Weiß, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility;Sebastian J.

First attempts have been made to analyze tonal properties (e. g., harmonic and melodic intervals) based on fundamental frequency (F0) trajectories. One major challenge in F0-based tonal analysis is introduced by unstable regions in the trajectories due to pitch slides and other frequency fluctuations. In this paper, we describe two approaches for detecting stable regions in frequency trajectories: the first algorithm uses morphological operations inspired by image processing, and the second one is based on suitably defined binary time–frequency masks. To avoid undesired distortions in subsequent analysis steps, both approaches keep the original F0-values unmodified, while only removing F0-values in unstable trajectory regions. We evaluate both approaches against manually annotated stable regions and discuss their potential in the context of interval analysis for traditional three-part Georgian singing.;"Sebastian Rosenzweig, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility;Frank Scherbaum, University of Potsdam, Germany, education;Meinard Müller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility";International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, University of Potsdam, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen;facility, education, facility;DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;27.361649;-4.1991563

Recently, in the case of multi-pitch estimation, the depth of the input layer of a convolutional network has been used to represent the harmonic series of pitch candidates. We use a similar idea here to represent the harmonic series of tempo candidates. We propose the Harmonic-Constant-Q-Modulation which represents, using a 4D-tensors, the harmonic series of modulation frequencies (considered as tempo frequencies) in several acoustic frequency bands over time. This representation is used as input to a convolutional network which is trained to estimate tempo or rhythm pattern classes. Using a large number of datasets, we evaluate the performance of our approach and compare it with previous approaches.

Training them for various tasks at once commonly results in worse performances than training them for a single specialized task. In this work, we introduce the Conditioned-U-Net (C-U-Net) which adds a control mechanism to the standard U-Net. The control mechanism allows us to train a unique and generic U-Net to perform the separation of various instruments. The C-U-Net decides the instrument to isolate according to a one-hot-encoding input vector. The input vector is embedded to obtain the parameters that control Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers. FiLM layers modify the U-Net feature maps in order to separate the desired instrument via affine transformations.

In recent years, retrieval systems based on embedding space learning with deep neural networks got a step closer to fulfilling this vision. However, global and local tempo deviations in the music recordings still require careful tuning of the amount of temporal context given to the system. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing an additional soft-attention mechanism on the audio input. Quantitative and qualitative results on synthesized piano data indicate that this attention increases the robustness of the retrieval system by focusing on different parts of the input representation based on the tempo of the audio.

A typical scenario involves manual annotation of different recordings of the same piece along the time dimension, for comparative analysis of, e.g., the musical tempo, or for mapping other performance-related information between performances. This can be done by manually annotating one reference performance, and then automatically synchronizing other performances, using audio-to-audio alignment algorithms. In this paper we address several questions related to those tasks. First, we analyze different annotations of the same musical piece, quantifying timing deviations between the respective human annotators. A statistical evaluation of the marker time stamps will provide (a) an estimate of the expected timing precision of human annotations and (b) a ground truth for subsequent automatic alignment experiments. We then carry out a systematic evaluation of different audio features for audio-to-audio alignment, quantifying the degree of alignment accuracy that can be achieved, and relate this to the results from the annotation study.;"Thassilo Gadermaier, Institute of Computational Perception, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria, education, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI), Vienna, Austria, facility;Gerhard Widmer, Institute of Computational Perception, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria, education, Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI), Vienna, Austria, facility";Johannes Kepler University,Johannes Kepler University;education, education;AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-15.181249;-31.576784

However, modeling this aspect in MIR systems has been notoriously challenging since emotion is an inherently abstract and subjective experience, thus making it difficult to quantify or predict in the first place, and to make sense of the predictions in the next. In an attempt to create a model that can give a musically meaningful and intuitive explanation for its prediction, we propose a VGG-style deep neural network that learns to predict emotional characteristics of a musical piece together with (and based on) human-interpretable, mid-level perceptual features. We compare this to predicting emotion directly with an identical network that does not take into account the mid-level features, and observe that the cost of going through the mid-level features is surprisingly low, on average. The design of our network allows us to visualize the effects of perceptual features on individual emotion predictions, and we argue that the small loss in performance in going through the mid-level features is justified by the gain in explainability of the predictions.;"Shreyan Chowdhury, Institute of Computational Perception, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria, education;Andreu Vall, Institute of Computational Perception, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria, education;Verena Haunschmid, Institute of Computational Perception, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria, education;Gerhard Widmer, Institute of Computational Perception, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria, education";Johannes Kepler University,Johannes Kepler University,Johannes Kepler University,Johannes Kepler University;education, education, education, education;AUT, AUT, AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-28.694866;60.24646

The timbral features in each section are assumed to follow emission distributions that are homogeneous over time. The lower-level left-to-right Markov chain in each section represents a chord sequence whose sequential order is constrained to be a repetition of a chord sequence in another section of the same cluster.

These four models were grouped into an ensemble that generated chord labels by voting, achieving 91.4% accuracy on a reserved test set. A domain expert then corrected only those chords that the ensemble did not agree on unanimously (20.9% of the generated labels). Finally, we used these corrected annotations to re-train the machine learning models, and the resulting ensemble attained an accuracy of 93.5% on the reserved test set, a 24.4% reduction in the number of errors.

Many of these approaches are ultimately based on a dynamic programming approach such as sequence alignment or edit distance, which has various drawbacks. First, the similarity scores are not necessarily metrics and are not directly comparable. Second, the algorithms are mostly first-order and of quadratic time-complexity, and finally, the features and weights need to be defined precisely.

"Kento Watanabe;Masataka Goto";Query-by-Blending: A Music Exploration System Blending Latent Vector Representations of Lyric Word, Song Audio, and Artist;2019;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3527762;This paper presents Query-by-Blending, a novel music exploration system that enables users to find unfamiliar music content by flexibly combining three musical aspects: lyric word, song audio, and artist. Although there are various systems for music retrieval based on the similarity between songs or artists and for music browsing based on visualized songs, it is still difficult to explore unfamiliar content by flexibly combining multiple musical aspects. Query-by-Blending overcomes this difficulty by representing each of the aspects as a latent vector representation (called a flavor in this paper) that is a distinctive quality felt to be characteristic of a given word/song/artist. By giving a lyric word as a query, for example, a user can find songs and artists whose flavors are similar to the flavor of the query word. Moreover, by giving a query combining (blending) lyric-word and song-audio flavors, the user can interactively explore unfamiliar content containing the blended flavor. This multi-aspect blending was achieved by constructing a novel vector space model into which all of the lyric words, song audio tracks, and artist IDs of a collection can be embedded. In our experiments, we embedded 14,505 lyric words, 433,936 songs, and 44,696 artists into the same shared vector space and found that the system can appropriately calculate similarities between different aspects and blend flavors to find related lyric words, songs, and artists.;"Kento Watanabe, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;facility, facility;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-13.750985;22.022005

The loops are presented in an interface that allows users to immediately remix the loops; if users upload multiple tracks, they can easily create mash-ups with the loops, which are automatically matched in tempo. To analyze the audio, we use a recently-proposed method of source separation based on the nonnegative Tucker decomposition of the spectrum. To reduce interference among the extracted loops, we propose an extra factorization step with a sparseness constraint and demonstrate that it improves the source separation result. We also propose a method for selecting the best instances of the extracted loops and demonstrate its effectiveness in an evaluation. Both of these improvements are incorporated into the backend of the interface. Finally, we discuss the feedback collected in a set of user evaluations.";"Jordan B. L.

Although dancing is highly related to dance music and dance information can be considered an important aspect of music information, research on dance information processing has not yet received much attention in the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community. We therefore developed the AIST Dance DB as the first large-scale shared database focusing on street dances to facilitate research on a variety of tasks related to dancing to music. It consists of 13,939 dance videos covering 10 major dance genres as well as 60 pieces of dance music composed for those genres. The videos were recorded by having 40 professional dancers (25 male and 15 female) dance to those pieces. We carefully designed this database so that it can cover both solo dancing and group dancing as well as both basic choreography moves and advanced moves originally choreographed by each dancer. Moreover, we used multiple cameras surrounding a dancer to simultaneously shoot from various directions. The AIST Dance DB will foster new MIR tasks such as dance-motion genre classification, dancer identification, and dance-technique estimation. We propose a dance-motion genre-classification task and developed four baseline methods of identifying dance genres of videos in this database. We evaluated these methods by extracting dancer body motions and training their classifiers on the basis of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network models and support-vector machine (SVM) models.;"Shuhei Tsuchida, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility;Satoru Fukayama, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility;Masahiro Hamasaki, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;facility, facility, facility, facility;JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;42.883728;29.226572
"Fu Zih-Sing;Li Su";Hierarchical Classification Networks for Singing Voice Segmentation and Transcription;2019;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3527960;Identifying the onset and offset time of a musical note is a challenging step for singing voice transcription, as the soft onset/offset, portamento, and vibrato phenomena are rich in singing voice signals. In this work, we investigate how to utilize local data representation with pattern recognition for onset and offset detection of singing voice. We consider onset and offset detection as a hierarchical classification problem, where every local data representation as input is classified into one of all the possible event states in monophonic singing, namely the silence, activation, and transition states, and the transition state is further classified into the onset and offset states. An objective function based on this hierarchical taxonomy nicely guides the model to capture the complicated temporal dynamics of note sequences. Multi-channel data representations containing spectral differences and pitch saliency are employed to reflect the patterns of note transition in singing voice signals. The proposed method implemented with residual networks provides improved performance over prior art in onset and offset detection. Moreover, by integrating with a pitch detection framework, the proposed method also outperforms previous singing voice transcription methods. This result emphasizes the importance of note segmentation in singing voice transcription.;"Zih-Sing Fu, National Taiwan University, TWN, education;Li Su, Academia Sinica, TWN, facility";National Taiwan University, Academia Sinica;education, facility;TWN, TWN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;34.375385;-6.438677

In general, an analogy is made by partially transferring the music abstractions, i.e., high-level representations and their relationships, from one piece to another; however, this procedure requires disentangling music representations, which usually takes little effort for musicians but is non-trivial for computers. Three sub-problems arise: extracting latent representations from the observation, disentangling the representations so that each part has a unique semantic interpretation, and mapping the latent representations back to actual music. In this paper, we contribute an explicitly-constrained variational autoencoder (EC^2-VAE) as a unified solution to all three sub-problems. We focus on disentangling the pitch and rhythm representations of 8-beat music clips conditioned on chords. In producing music analogies, this model helps us to realize the imaginary situation of what if a piece is composed using a different pitch contour, rhythm pattern, or chord progression by borrowing the representations from other pieces. Finally, we validate the proposed disentanglement method using objective measurements and evaluate the analogy examples by a subjective study.";"Ruihan Yang, Music X Lab, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education;Dingsu Wang, Music X Lab, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education;Ziyu Wang, Music X Lab, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education;Tianyao Chen, Music X Lab, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education;Junyan Jiang, Music X Lab, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education; Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon University, USA, education;Gus Xia, Music X Lab, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education";New York University Shanghai,New York University Shanghai,New York University Shanghai,New York University Shanghai,New York University Shanghai,Carnegie Mellon University, New York University Shanghai;education, education, education, education, education, education, education;CHN, CHN, CHN, CHN, CHN, USA, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developed economies, Developing economies;3.9023836;-15.64149
"Jong Wook Kim;Juan Bello";Adversarial Learning for Improved Onsets and Frames Music Transcription;2019;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3527898;Automatic music transcription is considered to be one of the hardest problems in music information retrieval, yet recent deep learning approaches have achieved substantial improvements in transcription performance. These approaches commonly employ supervised learning models that predict various time-frequency representations, by minimizing element-wise losses such as the cross entropy function. However, applying the loss in this manner assumes conditional independence of each label given the input, and thus cannot accurately express inter-label dependencies. To address this issue, we introduce an adversarial training scheme that operates directly on the time-frequency representations and makes the output distribution closer to the ground-truth. Through adversarial learning, we achieve a consistent improvement in both frame-level and note-level metrics over Onsets and Frames, a state-of-the-art music transcription model. Our results show that adversarial learning can significantly reduce the error rate while increasing the confidence of the model estimations. Our approach is generic and applicable to any transcription model based on multi-label predictions, which are very common in music signal analysis.;"Jong Wook Kim, Music and Audio Research Lab, New York University, USA, education;Juan Pablo Bello, Music and Audio Research Lab, New York University, USA, education";New York University, New York University;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;12.34396;-25.997068

Hierarchical structure annotation expands this idea to allow an annotator to segment a song with multiple levels of granularity. While there has been recent progress in developing evaluation criteria for comparing two hierarchical annotations of the same recording, the existing methods have known deficiencies when dealing with inexact label matchings and sequential label repetition. In this article, we investigate methods for automatically enhancing structural annotations by inferring (and expanding) hierarchical information from the segment labels. The proposed method complements existing techniques for comparing hierarchical structural annotations by coarsening or refining labels with variation markers to either collapse similarly labeled segments together, or separate identically labeled segments from each other. Using the multi-level structure annotations provided in the SALAMI dataset, we demonstrate that automatic hierarchy expansion allows structure comparison methods to more accurately assess similarity between annotations.;"Brian McFee, Music and Audio Research Lab, New York University, USA, education, Center for Data Science, New York University, USA, education;Katherine M.

Through animated transitions between local k-nn maps, the interface creates the impression of panning a large global map.

Disagreements about these judgments have led to extensive theoretical debates and ongoing controversies. Such debates are exacerbated by the absence of a pubic corpus of expert Roman numeral analyses, and by the more fundamental lack of an agreed-upon, computer-readable syntax in which those analyses might be expressed.

We use scheduled sampling to make the MLM robust to noisy sequences during testing.

A common feature of these techniques is the periodic modulation in the time--frequency domain. We propose a representation based on time--frequency scattering to model the inter-class variability for fine discrimination of these periodic modulations. Time--frequency scattering is an instance of the scattering transform, an approach for building invariant, stable, and informative signal representations. The proposed representation is calculated around the wavelet subband of maximal acoustic energy, rather than over all the wavelet bands. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we build a system that computes the representation as input to a machine learning classifier. Whereas previously published datasets for playing technique analysis focus primarily on techniques recorded in isolation, for ecological validity, we create a new dataset to evaluate the system. The dataset, named CBF-periDB, contains full-length expert performances on the Chinese bamboo flute that have been thoroughly annotated by the players themselves.

Original algorithms proposed for this task have proven their accuracy on small datasets, but are unable to scale up to modern real-life audio corpora.

In this work, we propose a neural network architecture that is trained to represent each track as a single embedding vector. The computation burden is therefore left to the embedding extraction -that can be conducted offline and stored, while the pairwise comparison task reduces to a simple Euclidean distance computation. We further propose to extract each track's embedding out of its dominant melody representation, obtained by another neural network trained for this task. We then show that this architecture improves state-of-the-art accuracy both on small and large datasets, and is able to scale to query databases of thousands of tracks in a few seconds.;"Guillaume Doras, Sacem & Ircam Lab, CNRS, Sorbonne Université, FRA, facility;Geoffroy Peeters, LTCI, Telecom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, FRA, education";SACEM, Telecom ParisTech;facility, education;FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;11.877325;45.486656

Improvements in deep learning lead to a big progress in music source separation performance. However, most of the previous studies are restricted to separating a few limited number of sources, such as vocals, drums, bass, and other. In this study, we propose a network for audio query-based music source separation that can explicitly encode the source information from a query signal regardless of the number and/or kind of target signals. The proposed method consists of a Query-net and a Separator: given a query and a mixture, the Query-net encodes the query into the latent space, and the Separator estimates masks conditioned by the latent vector, which is then applied to the mixture for separation. The Separator can also generate masks using the latent vector from the training samples, allowing separation in the absence of a query. We evaluate our method on the MUSDB18 dataset, and experimental results show that the proposed method can separate multiple sources with a single network. In addition, through further investigation of the latent space we demonstrate that our method can generate continuous outputs via latent vector interpolation.;"Jie Hwan Lee, Seoul National University, KOR, education;Hyeong-Seok Choi, Seoul National University, KOR, education;Kyogu Lee, Seoul National University, KOR, education";Seoul National University, Seoul National University, Seoul National University;education, education, education;KOR, KOR, KOR;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;42.415653;-20.771656

"Jeffrey Ens;Philippe Pasquier";Quantifying Musical Style: Ranking Symbolic Music based on Similarity to a Style;2019;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3527952;Modelling human perception of musical similarity is critical for the evaluation of generative music systems, musicological research, and many Music Information Retrieval tasks. Although human similarity judgments are the gold standard, computational analysis is often preferable, since results are often easier to reproduce, and computational methods are much more scalable. Moreover, computation based approaches can be calculated quickly and on demand, which is a prerequisite for use with an online system. We propose StyleRank, a method to measure the similarity between a MIDI file and an arbitrary musical style delineated by a collection of MIDI files. MIDI files are encoded using a novel set of features and an embedding is learned using Random Forests. Experimental evidence demonstrates that StyleRank is highly correlated with human perception of stylistic similarity, and that it is precise enough to rank generated samples based on their similarity to the style of a corpus. In addition, similarity can be measured with respect to a single feature, allowing specific discrepancies between generated samples and a particular musical style to be identified.;"Jeff Ens, Simon Fraser University, CAN, education;Philippe Pasquier, Simon Fraser University, CAN, education";Simon Fraser University, Simon Fraser University;education, education;CAN, CAN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-13.02861;-0.3331725

We adapt a framework based on variational autoencoders with Gaussian mixture latent distributions. Specifically, we use two separate encoders to learn distinct latent spaces for timbre and pitch, which form Gaussian mixture components representing instrument identity and pitch, respectively. For reconstruction, latent variables of timbre and pitch are sampled from corresponding mixture components, and are concatenated as the input to a decoder. We show the model's efficacy using latent space visualization, and a quantitative analysis indicates the discriminability of these spaces, even with a limited number of instrument labels for training. The model allows for controllable synthesis of selected instrument sounds by sampling from the latent spaces. To evaluate this, we trained instrument and pitch classifiers using original labeled data. These classifiers achieve high F-scores when tested on our synthesized sounds, which verifies the model's performance of controllable realistic timbre/pitch synthesis. Our model also enables timbre transfer between multiple instruments, with a single encoder-decoder architecture, which is evaluated by measuring the shift in the posterior of instrument classification. Our in-depth evaluation confirms the model's ability to successfully disentangle timbre and pitch.;"Yin-Jyun Luo, Singapore University of Technology and Design, SGP, education, Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR, Singapore, SGP, facility;Kat Agres, Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR, Singapore, SGP, facility, Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music, National University of Singapore, SGP, education;Dorien Herremans, Singapore University of Technology and Design, SGP, education, Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR, Singapore, SGP, facility";Singapore University of Technology and Design, Institute of High Performance Computing A*STAR , Singapore University of Technology and Design;education, facility, education;SGP, SGP, SGP;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;7.5600734;-15.093995

As a result, there is an emerging divide in the MIR research community between labs that have access to music through large companies with abundant funds, and independent labs at smaller institutions who do not have such expansive access. This paper explores how independent researchers have worked to overcome limitations of access to music data without contributing to the crisis of reproducibility. Acknowledging that there is no single solution for every data access problem that smaller labs face, we propose a number of possibilities for how the MIR community can bridge the gap between advancements from large companies and those within academia.

In the learning stage, a sequence of stylistically uniform, multiple-channel music samples was modeled by an RNN. In the composition stage, a short clip of randomly-generated music was used as a seed for the RNN to start music score prediction. To form structured music, segments of generated music from different seeds were concatenated together. To improve the quality and structure of the generated music, we integrated music theory knowledge into the model, such as controlling the spacing of gaps in the vocal melody, normalizing the timing of chord changes, and requiring notes to be related to the song's key (C major, for example). This integration improved the quality of the generated music as verified by a professional composer. We also conducted a subjective listening test that showed our generated music was close to original music by the Beatles in terms of style similarity, professional quality, and interestingness.;"Yichao Zhou, Snap Inc., USA, company, Department of EECS, University of California, Berkeley, USA, education;Wei Chu, Snap Inc., USA, company;Sam Young, Snap Inc., USA, company, Herb Alpert School of Music, University of California, Los Angeles, USA, education;Xin Chen, Snap Inc., USA, company";Snap Inc., Snap Inc., Snap Inc., Snap Inc.;company, company, company, company;USA, USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;8.006573;-29.91572

In music information retrieval (MIR), features learned from windowed spectrograms are highly variant to transformations like transposition or time-shift. Such variances are undesirable when they are irrelevant for the respective MIR task. We propose an architecture called Complex Autoencoder (CAE) which learns features invariant to orthogonal transformations. Mapping signals onto complex basis functions learned by the CAE results in a transformation-invariant magnitude space and a transformation-variant phase space. The phase space is useful to infer transformations between data pairs. When exploiting the invariance-property of the magnitude space, we achieve state-of-the-art results in audio-to-score alignment and in repeated section discovery for audio.

In this paper we present a two-component system to automate the task of resonance equalization. The first component is a dynamic equalizer that automatically detects resonances and offers to attenuate them by a user-specified factor. The second component is a deep neural network that predicts the optimal attenuation factor based on the windowed audio. The network is trained and validated on empirical data gathered from an experiment in which sound engineers choose their preferred attenuation factors for a set of tracks. We test two distinct network architectures for the predictive model and find that a dilated residual network operating directly on the audio signal is on a par with a network architecture that requires a prior audio feature extraction stage.

In DrummerNet, the target drum signal is first passed to a (trainable) transcriber, then reconstructed in a (fixed) synthesizer according to the transcription estimate.

"Rachel Bittner;Juan Jose Bosch";Generalized Metrics for Single-f0 Estimation Evaluation;2019;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3527916;Single-f0 estimation methods, including pitch trackers and melody estimators, have historically been evaluated using a set of common metrics which score estimates frame-wise in terms of pitch and voicing accuracy. Voicing refers to whether or not a pitch is active, and has historically been regarded as a binary value. However, this has limitations because it is often ambiguous whether a pitch is present or absent, making a binary choice difficult for humans and algorithms alike. For example, when a source fades out or reverberates, the exact point where the pitch is no longer present is unclear. Many single-f0 estimation algorithms select a threshold for when a pitch is active or not, and different choices of threshold drastically affect the results of standard metrics. In this paper, we present a refinement on the existing single-f0 metrics, by allowing the estimated voicing to be represented as a continuous likelihood, and introducing a weighting on frame level pitch accuracy, which considers the energy of the source producing the f0 relative to the energy of the rest of the signal. We compare these metrics experimentally with the previous metrics using a number of algorithms and datasets and discuss the fundamental differences. We show that, compared to the previous metrics, our proposed metrics allow threshold-independent algorithm comparisons.;"Rachel Bittner, Spotify, USA, company;Juan J.

To date, the most popular formulation of the problem has been to compare the audio signals of two tracks and to make a binary decision based on this information only. However, leveraging additional signals might be key if one wants to solve the problem at an industrial scale. In this paper, we introduce an ensemble-based method that approaches the problem from a many-to-many perspective. Instead of considering pairs of tracks in isolation, we consider larger sets of potential versions for a given composition, and create and exploit the graph of relationships between these tracks. We show that this can result in a significant improvement in performance, in particular when the number of existing versions of a given composition is large.;"Marc Sarfati, Spotify, company;Anthony Hu, Spotify, company;Jonathan Donier, Spotify, company";Spotify, Spotify, Spotify;company, company, company;SWE, SWE, SWE;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;13.122254;46.084038

Recent advances in deep learning have turned typical OMR obstacles into clearly solvable problems, especially the stages that visually process the input image, such as staff line removal or detection of music-notation objects. However, merely detecting objects is not enough for retrieving the actual content, as music notation is a configurational writing system where the semantic of a primitive is defined by its relationship to other primitives. Thus, OMR systems must employ a notation assembly stage to infer such relationships among the detected objects. So far, this stage has been addressed by devising a set of predefined rules or grammars, which hardly generalize well. In this work, we formulate the notation assembly stage from a set of detected primitives as a machine learning problem. Our notation assembly is modeled as a graph that stores syntactic relationships among primitives, which allows us to capture the configuration of symbols in a music-notation document. Our results over the handwritten sheet music corpus MUSCIMA++ show 95.2% precision, 96.0% recall, and an F-score of 95.6% in establishing the correct syntactic relationships.

More recently, several attempts have been made to extend such approaches to music (both symbolic and audio) in order to enable transforming musical style in a similar manner. In this study, we focus on symbolic music with the goal of altering the 'style' of a piece while keeping its original 'content'. As opposed to the current methods, which are inherently restricted to be unsupervised due to the lack of 'aligned' data (i.e. the same musical piece played in multiple styles), we develop the first fully supervised algorithm for this task. At the core of our approach lies a synthetic data generation scheme which allows us to produce virtually unlimited amounts of aligned data, and hence avoid the above issue. In view of this data generation scheme, we propose an encoder-decoder model for translating symbolic music accompaniments between a number of different styles.

Although the task itself is interesting and challenging for both academia and industry scenarios, there are a number of limitations for the advancement of current approaches. We specifically address two of them in the present study. First, the number of publicly available datasets for this task is limited, and there is no publicly available benchmark set that is widely used among researchers for comparative algorithm evaluation. Second, most of the algorithms are not publicly shared and reproducible, limiting the comparison of approaches. To overcome these limitations we propose Da-TACOS, a DaTAset for COver Song Identification and Understanding, and two frameworks for feature extraction and benchmarking to facilitate reproducibility.

In this work, through the statistical analysis of more than 400K playlists from four datasets, created in different temporal and technological contexts, we aim to understand if it is possible to extract information about the evolution of humans strategies for playlist creation.

Music features are available via the AcousticBrainz database. To guide research, we suggest a concrete research task and provide a baseline as well as an evaluation method. This task may serve as an example of the development and validation of automatic annotation algorithms on complementary datasets with different taxonomies and coverage.

The expert performer and researcher of the Moroccan tradition of this music, Amin Chaachoo, is developing a theory, whose last formulation was recently published in La Mu-sique Hispano-Arabe, al-Ala (2016), which argues that centonization, a melodic composition technique used in Gregorian chant, was also utilized for the creation of this repertoire. In this paper we aim to contribute to Chaachoo's theory by means of tf-idf analysis. A highorder n-gram model is applied to a corpus of 149 prescriptive transcriptions of heterophonic recordings, representing each as an unordered multiset of patterns. Computing the tf-idf statistic of each pattern in this corpus provides a means by which we can rank and compare motivic content across nawabāt, distinct musical forms of the tradition. For each nawba, an empirical comparison is made between patterns identified as significant via our approach and those proposed by Chaachoo. Ultimately we observe considerable agreement between the two pattern sets and go further in proposing new, unique and as yet undocumented patterns that occur at least as frequently and with at least as much importance as those in Chaachoo's proposals.;"Thomas Nuttall, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Miguel García Casado, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Víctor Núñez Tarifa, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Rafael Caro Repetto, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Xavier Serra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education";Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universitat Pompeu Fabra;education, education, education, education, education;ESP, ESP, ESP, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-9.516613;1.7923002

The MC is a gap in the musical texture between the Transition zone (TR) and the Secondary thematic zone (S). It appears as a climax of energy accumulation initiated by the TR, dividing the Exposition in two parts. We introduce high-level features relevant to formalize this energy gain and to identify MCs. These features concern rhythmic, harmonic and textural aspects of the music and characterize either the MC, its preparation or the texture contrast between TR and S. They are used to train a LSTM neural network on a corpus of 27 movements of string quartets written by Mozart. The model correctly locates the MCs on 14 movements within a leave-one-piece-out validation strategy.

However, only a few models currently deal with the recognition of advanced Instrument Playing Techniques (IPT). None of them have a real-time approach of this problem. Furthermore, most studies rely on a single sound bank for training and testing. Their methodology provides no assurance as to the generalization of their results to other sounds. In this article, we extend state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks to the classification of IPTs. We build the first IPT corpus from independent sound banks, annotate it with the JAMS standard and make it freely available. Our models yield consistently high accuracies on a homogeneous subset of this corpus. However, only a proper taxonomy of IPTs and specifically defined input transforms offer proper resilience when addressing the minus-1db methodology, which assesses the ability of the models to generalize. In particular, we introduce a novel Folded Constant Q-Transform adjusted to the requirements of IPT classification.

Most previous Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) methods seek a piano-roll representation of the pitches, that can be further transformed into a score by incorporating tempo estimation, beat tracking, key estimation or rhythm quantization. Unlike these methods, our approach generates music notation directly from the input audio in a single stage. For this, we use a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function which does not require annotated alignments of audio frames with the score rhythmic information. We trained our model using as input Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven string quartets and Bach chorales synthesized with different tempos and expressive performances. The output is a textual representation of four-voice music scores based on **kern format. Although the proposed approach is evaluated in a simplified scenario, results show that this model can learn to transcribe scores directly from audio signals, opening a promising avenue towards complete AMT.;"Miguel A.

Still, the application of music information retrieval to this repertoire is restricted by the use of digitalisation techniques which produce an uncodified output. Optical Music Recognition (OMR) automatically generates a symbolic representation of image-based musical content, thus making this repertoire reachable from the computational point of view; yet, further improvements are often constricted by the limited ground truth available. We address this lacuna by presenting a symbolic representation in original notation of Il Lauro Secco, an anthology of Italian madrigals in white mensural notation.

A typical solution to this problem is a proposed orchestral score where candidate scores are ranked by similarity in some feature space between the target sound and the mixture of audio samples in the database corresponding to the notes in the score; in the orchestral setting, valid scores may contain dozens of instruments sounding simultaneously. Generally, target-based assisted orchestration systems consist of a combinatorial optimization algorithm and a constraint solver that are jointly optimized to find valid solutions. A key step in the optimization involves generating a large number of combinations of sounds from the database and then comparing the features of each mixture of sounds with the target sound. Because of the high computational cost required to synthesize a new audio file and then compute features for every combination of sounds, in practice, existing systems instead estimate the features of each new mixture using precomputed features of the individual source files making up the combination. Currently, state of the art systems use a simple linear combination to make these predictions, even if the features in use are not themselves linear. In this work, we explore neural models for estimating the features of a mixture of sounds from the features of the component sounds, finding that standard features can be estimated with accuracy significantly better than that of the methods currently used in assisted orchestration systems.

Transformers are complex, high-dimensional language models which are capable of capturing long-term structure in sequence data, but require large amounts of data to fit. Their success on piano score generation is partially explained by the large volumes of symbolic data readily available for that domain. We leverage the recently-introduced NES-MDB dataset of four-voice scores from an early video game sound synthesis chip (the NES), which we find to be well-suited to training with the Transformer architecture. To further improve the performance of our model, we propose a pre-training technique to leverage the information in a large collection of heterogeneous music.

Second, we construct a micro-timing profile (mtP) for every performance by averaging the binary features across the recording. An mtP codifies the frequency with which the various features were found in a performance.

We focus on modeling the relationship between two highly diverse data, music and real-world videos. We learn cross-modal embeddings using a two-stream network trained with music-video pairs. Each branch takes one modality as the input and it is constrained with emotion tags. Then the constraints allow the cross-modal embeddings to be learned with significantly fewer music-video pairs.

Quantitative evaluations show high accuracy of audio/video emotion tagging when evaluated on each branch independently and high performance for cross-modal music retrieval.

Although the previously proposed system employing a noise suppression process and a rule-based pitch control approach has achieved preliminary success in converting EL speech into a singing voice, there are still two major limitations. First, the converted singing voice still sounds mechanical and unnatural owing to the adverse impacts of spectrograms extracted from EL speeches, also making the effect of pitch control limited. Second, the capability and flexibility of the rule-based pitch control in modeling various singing styles are insufficient, causing the converted singing voices to lack variety. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an improved system that uses 1) a statistical voice conversion approach to convert spectrograms extracted from EL speeches into those of natural speeches and 2) a deep generative model-based approach called VAE-SPACE for pitch modification, which generates pitch patterns in a data-driven manner instead of following manually designed rules. The experimental results revealed that 1) the conversion of spectrograms was effective in improving the naturalness of singing voices, and 2) the statistical pitch control approach was able to achieve comparable results with the rule-based approach, which was very carefully designed to be specialized in singing.;"Li Li, University of Tsukuba, JPN, education;Tomoki Toda, Nagoya University, JPN, education;Kazuho Morikawa, Nagoya University, JPN, education;Kazuhiro Kobayashi, Nagoya University, JPN, education;Shoji Makino, University of Tsukuba, JPN, education";University of Tsukuba, Nagoya University, Nagoya University, Nagoya University, University of Tsukuba;education, education, education, education, education;JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;32.48836;-9.704854

In this paper, we aim to better understand the factors that affect people's decisions as to whether they choose to listen to music recommendations and how the recommendations impact their music-listening behaviors. We conducted an online survey asking about people's past experiences on giving and receiving music recommendations. We found that in addition to the aesthetic qualities of music and the respondent's taste, expectations regarding the delivery (e.g., timing, persistence) of the recommendations, familiarity, trust in the recommender's abilities, and the rationale for suggestions were important factors. We discuss the implications for the design of music recommenders based on the findings, including better rationale for and accessibility of recommended music, improved saving options, and more targeted delivery at specific times. The data also suggests disparities in how people wish to receive music recommendations and what will influence them to listen to recommendations, versus how they would like to offer recommendations to others. In addition, the findings highlight the importance of music recommendations in people's existing social relationships and their role in building/improving new relationships.;"Jin Ha Lee, University of Washington, USA, education;Liz Pritchard, University of Washington, USA, education;Chris Hubbles, University of Washington, USA, education";University of Washington, University of Washington, University of Washington;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-40.707516;33.672802

We introduce a dataset, which contains monophonic and polyphonic data, both in symbolic and audio representations. We suggest a standardized evaluation procedure to compare algorithmic musical predictions. We compare two neural network models to a baseline model and show that algorithmic approaches can correctly predict about a third of a monophonic segment, and around half of a polyphonic segment, with one of the neural network models achieving best results.

In spite of its convenience, the chord symbol notation only provides basic information about the chordal configuration, and leaves much room for interpretation. With such limitations, an algorithm generating merely chord symbols is usually insufficient for a wide range of music genres such as jazz. To solve this problem, we propose chord jazzification, a process to generate realistic chord configurations in jazz style. With deep learning approaches, we decompose chord jazzification into coloring and voicing. Coloring concerns the choice of color tones, while voicing concerns the configurations of chords. We also create a new dataset featuring interpretations of chord symbols in pop-jazz compositions. By conducting experiments on the new dataset, we show that 1) the two-stage process outperforms an end-to-end generation approach in modeling chord configurations, and 2) attention-based models are better at capturing the structure of chord sequences in comparison with recurrent neural networks.;"Tsung-Ping Chen, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan, education;Satoru Fukayama, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility;Li Su, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan, education";Academia Sinica, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Academia Sinica;facility, facility, facility, facility;TWN, JPN, JPN, TWN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developing economies;22.541248;-55.423

Existing methods for instrumental playing technique detection mostly focus on the local features extracted from audio. However, we argue that structural information is critical for both global and local tasks, particularly considering the characteristics of Guqin music. Incorporating mode and playing technique analysis, this study demonstrates that the structural relationship between notes is crucial for detecting mode, and such information also provides extra guidance for the playing technique detection in local-level. In this study, a new dataset is compiled for Guqin performance analysis. The mode detection is achieved by pattern matching, and the predicted results are conjoined with audio features to be inputted into a neural network for playing technique detection. Advanced techniques are developed to optimize the extracted pitch contour from the audio. It is manifest in the results that the global and local features are inter-connected in Guqin music.

During inference, we generate one edit event at a time using direct ancestral sampling. Our approach allows the model to fix previous mistakes such as incorrectly sampled notes and prevent accumulation of errors which autoregressive models are prone to have. Another benefit of our approach is a finer degree of control during human and AI collaboration as our approach is notewise online.

While this method is effective for popular artists with large fanbases, it can present difficulties for recommending novel, lesser known artists due to a relative lack of user preference data. In this paper, we therefore seek to understand how content-based approaches can be used to more effectively recommend songs from these lesser known artists. Specifically, we conduct a user study to answer three questions. Firstly, do most users agree which songs are most acoustically similar? Secondly, is acoustic similarity a good proxy for how an individual might construct a playlist or recommend music to a friend? Thirdly, if so, can we find acoustic features that are related to human judgments of acoustic similarity? To answer these questions, our study asked 117 test subjects to compare two unknown candidate songs relative to a third known reference song.

Rhythmic and metrical structure are closely intertwined, particularly in the tonal idiom. While there have been many approaches for modeling musical tempo, beat and meter and their inference, musical rhythm and its complexity have been comparably less explored and formally modeled. The model formulates a generative grammar of symbolic rhythmic musical structure and its internal recursive substructure. The approach characterizes rhythmic groups in alignment with meter in terms of the recursive subdivision of temporal units, as well as dependencies established by recursive operations such as preparation and different kinds of shifting (such as anticipation and delay). The model is formulated in terms of an abstract context-free grammar and applies for monophonic rhythms and harmonic rhythm.;Martin Rohrmeier, Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, CHE, education;École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;education;CHE;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;38.072083;19.464624

One of the most important features of this structure is the organisation of modulations between different keys throughout a piece. Music theoretical research has established taxonomies of prototypical modulation plans for different modes and musical forms. However, these prototypes still require empirical validation based on quantitative statistical methods and cannot be retrieved automatically so far.In this paper, we present a novel method to infer prototypical modulation plans from musical corpora. A modulation plan is formalised as a transposition-invariant probabilistic model over the underlying pitch class distributions based on a hierarchical pitch scape representation. Prototypical modulation plans can be learned in an unsupervised manner by training a mixture model (similar to a Gaussian mixture model) on the data, so that different prototypes appear as distinct clusters.We evaluate our approach by performing hierarchical clustering on a corpus of more than 150 Baroque pieces, with the extracted clusters showing excellent agreement with the most common prototypes postulated in music theory. Our method bears a great potential for modelling, analysis and discovery of hierarchical key structure and prototypes in corpora across a broad range of musical styles.

To that end, MDTK includes a script that measures the distribution of different types of errors in a transcription, and creates a degraded dataset with similar properties. MDTK's degradations can also be applied dynamically to a dataset during training (with or without the above script), generating novel degraded excerpts each epoch. MDTK could also be used to test the robustness of any system designed to take MIDI (or similar) data as input (e.g. systems designed for voice separation, metrical alignment, or chord detection) to such transcription errors or otherwise noisy data.

We additionally reflect this outlook when training the network, and include a simple data augmentation strategy to increase the network's exposure to a wider range of tempi, and hence beat and downbeat information. Via an in-depth comparative evaluation, we present state-of-the-art results over all three tasks, with performance increases of up to 6% points over existing systems.;"Sebastian Böck, enliteAI, Vienna, Austria, company;Matthew E.

In this work, we analyze sesquialteras in bambucos from two perspectives. First, we analyze the perception of beat and meter by asking 10 Colombian musicians to perform beat annotations in a dataset of bambucos. Results show great diversity in the annotations: a total of five different meters or meter combinations were found in the annotations, with each bambuco in the study being annotated in at least two different meters. Second, we perform a beat tracking analysis in a dataset of bambucos with two state-of-the-art algorithms. Given that the algorithms used in the analysis were designed to deal with the rhythmic regularity of a single meter, it is not surprising that tracking performance is not very high (~42% mean F-measure). However, a deeper analysis of the onset detection functions used for beat tracking, indicate that there is enough information on the signal level to characterize the bi-metric behavior of bambucos. With this in mind, we highlight possibilities for computational analysis of rhythm in bambucos.;"Estefanía Cano, Fraunhofer IDMT, DEU, facility;Fernando Mora-Ángel, Universidad de Antioquia, COL, education;Gustavo A.

Nevertheless, most of the existing systems focus exclusively on the problem of source separation itself and ignore the utilization of other~---possibly related---~MIR tasks which could lead to additional quality gains. In this work, we propose a novel multitask structure to investigate using instrument activation information to improve source separation performance. Furthermore, we investigate our system on six independent instruments, a more realistic scenario than the three instruments included in the widely-used MUSDB dataset, by leveraging a combination of the MedleyDB and Mixing Secrets datasets. The results show that our proposed multitask model outperforms the baseline Open-Unmix model on the mixture of Mixing Secrets and MedleyDB dataset while maintaining comparable performance on the MUSDB dataset.;"Yun-Ning Hung, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, education;Alexander Lerch, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, education";Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;38.119205;-22.905804

In this paper, we present a new symbolic music dataset that will help researchers working on disentanglement problems demonstrate the efficacy of their algorithms on diverse domains. This will also provide a means for evaluating algorithms specifically designed for music. To this end, we create a dataset comprising of 2-bar monophonic melodies where each melody is the result of a unique combination of nine latent factors that span ordinal, categorical, and binary types. The dataset is large enough (? 1.3 million data points) to train and test deep networks for disentanglement learning.

Although research in deep generative models has dramatically improved the capability and fluency of music models, recent work has shown that it can be challenging for humans to partner with this new class of algorithms. In this paper, we present findings on what 13 musician/developer teams, a total of 61 users, needed when co-creating a song with AI, the challenges they faced, and how they leveraged and repurposed existing characteristics of AI to overcome some of these challenges. Many teams adopted modular approaches, such as independently running multiple smaller models that align with the musical building blocks of a song, before re-combining their results. As ML models are not easily steerable, teams also generated massive numbers of samples and curated them post-hoc, or used a range of strategies to direct the generation or algorithmically ranked the samples. Ultimately, teams not only had to manage the ``flare and focus'' aspects of the creative process, but also juggle that with a parallel process of exploring and curating multiple ML models and outputs.

First, we found listeners generally stream fewer female or mixed-gender creator groups than male artists, with differences per genre. Second, while still relatively low, we found that recommendation-based streaming has a slightly higher proportion of female creators than organic listening (i.e., tracks that are not recommended by editors or algorithms). Third, we examined streaming data from 200,000 US users to determine the proportion of female artists in organic and recommended streams over a 28-day period and the relationship between recommended streams and users' future organic listening. The proportion of female artists in recommended streaming appears predictive of the proportion of female artists in organic streaming; these effects are moderated by gender and age. Fourth, this study also samples creators across different popularity levels, seeing more female and multi-gender groups at lower levels than in the middle tiers. However, solo female artists are better represented again in the superstars category, suggesting influence of selected superstars and genres.

Our work differs from previous studies on sheet music retrieval in two ways. First, we investigate the problem at a much larger scale than previous studies, using all solo piano sheet music images in the entire IMSLP dataset as a searchable database. Second, we use cell phone images of sheet music as our input queries, which lends itself to a practical, user-facing application. We show that a previously proposed fingerprinting method for sheet music retrieval is far too slow for a real-time application, and we diagnose its shortcomings. We propose a novel hashing scheme called dynamic n-gram fingerprinting that significantly reduces runtime while simultaneously boosting retrieval accuracy.

Whereas previous works focus on synthetic sheet music where the data has been cleaned and preprocessed, we instead focus on developing a system that can cope with the messiness of raw, unprocessed sheet music PDFs from IMSLP. We investigate how well existing systems cope with real scanned sheet music, filler pages and unrelated pieces or movements, and discontinuities due to jumps and repeats. We find that a significant bottleneck in system performance is handling jumps and repeats correctly. In particular, we find that a previously proposed Jump DTW algorithm does not perform robustly when jump locations are unknown a priori. We propose a novel alignment algorithm called Hierarchical DTW that can handle jumps and repeats even when jump locations are not known. It first performs alignment at the feature level on each sheet music line, and then performs a second alignment at the segment level. By operating at the segment level, it is able to encode domain knowledge about how likely a particular jump is. Through carefully controlled experiments on unprocessed sheet music PDFs from IMSLP, we show that Hierarachical DTW significantly outperforms Jump DTW in handling various types of jumps.;"Mengyi Shan, Harvey Mudd College, USA, education;TJ Tsai, Harvey Mudd College, USA, education";Harvey Mudd College, Harvey Mudd College;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;32.467655;16.15378

Previous approaches to the composer classification task have been limited by a scarcity of data. We address this issue in two ways: (1) we recast the problem to be based on raw sheet music images rather than a symbolic music format, and (2) we propose an approach that can be trained on unlabeled data. Our approach first converts the sheet music image into a sequence of musical ``words based on the bootleg feature representation, and then feeds the sequence into a text classifier. We show that it is possible to significantly improve classifier performance by first training a language model on a set of unlabeled data, initializing the classifier with the pretrained language model weights, and then finetuning the classifier on a small amount of labeled data. We train AWD-LSTM, GPT-2, and RoBERTa language models on all piano sheet music images in IMSLP. We find that transformer-based architectures outperform CNN and LSTM models, and pretraining boosts classification accuracy for the GPT-2 model from 46% to 70% on a 9-way classification task. The trained model can also be used as a feature extractor that projects piano sheet music into a feature space that characterizes compositional style.;"TJ Tsai, Harvey Mudd College, USA, education;Kevin Ji, Harvey Mudd College, USA, education";Harvey Mudd College, Harvey Mudd College;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-6.0849752;-45.964985

While recent breakthroughs have focussed on network architecture, we demonstrate that the representation of the sequence can make an equally significant contribution to the performance of the model as measured by validation set loss. By extracting salient features inherent to the training dataset, the model can either be conditioned on these features or trained to predict said features as extra components of the sequences being modelled. We show that training a neural network to predict a seemingly more complex sequence, with extra features included in the series being modelled, can improve overall model performance significantly. We first introduce TonicNet, a GRU-based model trained to initially predict the chord at a given time-step before then predicting the notes of each voice at that time-step, in contrast with the typical approach of predicting only the notes.

In this work we describe three attentive LSTM based approaches for dynamic emotion prediction from music clips.

We find that the LSTM based attention models perform better than the state of the art transformers for the dynamic emotion prediction task, both in terms of R2 and Kendall-Tau metrics. We explore individual smaller feature sets in search of a more effective one and to understand how different features contribute to perceived emotion. The spectral features are found to perform at par with the generic ComPare feature set [1].

A typical strategy is to compare score–audio pairs based on a common mid-level representation, such as chroma features. Several recent studies demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning models that learn task-specific mid-level representations from temporally aligned training pairs. However, in practice, there is often a lack of strongly aligned training data, in particular for real-world scenarios. In our study, we use weakly aligned score–audio pairs for training, where only the beginning and end of a score excerpt is annotated in an audio recording, without aligned correspondences in between. To exploit such weakly aligned data, we employ the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss to train a deep learning model for computing an enhanced chroma representation. We then apply this model to a cross-modal retrieval task, where we aim at finding relevant audio recordings of Western classical music, given a short monophonic musical theme in symbolic notation as a query. We present systematic experiments that show the effectiveness of the CTC-based model for this theme-based retrieval task.;"Frank Zalkow, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility;Meinard Müller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility";International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen;facility, facility;DEU, DEU;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-25.329748;5.398258

A prime example of this compositional technique is Richard Wagner's four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen.

R2 scores for personality, EQ, and SQ were 76.3%, 77.1%, and 86.7% respectively. As a follow-up, we investigated which bodily joints were most important in defining these traits. We discuss how further research may explore how the mapping of these traits to movement patterns can be used to build a more personalized, multi-modal recommendation system, as well as potential therapeutic applications.;"Yudhik Agrawal, Cognitive Science Lab, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, IND, education;Samyak Jain, Cognitive Science Lab, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, IND, education;Emily Carlson, Department of Music, Art and Culture Studies, University of Jyväskylä, FIN, education;Petri Toiviainen, Department of Music, Art and Culture Studies, University of Jyväskylä, FIN, education;Vinoo Alluri, Cognitive Science Lab, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, IND, education";International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad,International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad, University of Jyväskylä, University of Jyväskylä, International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad;education, education, education, education, education;IND, IND, FIN, FIN, IND;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developing economies;-63.866203;3.605704

These provide unprecedented accuracy across all discriminative tasks. However, the consistently overlooked downside of these models is their stunningly massive complexity, which seems concomitantly crucial to their success. In this paper, we address this issue by developing a new approach based on the recent lottery ticket hypothesis. We modify the original lottery approach to allow for explicitly removing parameters, through structured trimming of entire units, instead of simply masking individual weights. This allows to obtain models which are effectively lighter in terms of size, memory and number of operations.We show that our proposal allows to remove up to 95% of the models parameters without loss of accuracy, leading to ultra-light deep MIR models. We confirm the surprising result that, at smaller compression ratios (removing up to 90% of the network), lighter models consistently outperform their heavier counterpart. We exhibit these results on a large array of MIR tasks including audio classification, pitch recognition, chord extraction, drum transcription and onset estimation. These resulting ultra-light deep models for MIR can run on CPU, and can even fit on embedded devices with minimal degradation of accuracy.;"Philippe Esling, IRCAM - Sorbonne Université, CNRS UMR 9912, FRA, education;Theis Bazin, IRCAM - Sorbonne Université, CNRS UMR 9912, FRA, education;Adrien Bitton, IRCAM - Sorbonne Université, CNRS UMR 9912, FRA, education;Tristan Carsault, IRCAM - Sorbonne Université, CNRS UMR 9912, FRA, education;Ninon Devis, IRCAM - Sorbonne Université, CNRS UMR 9912, FRA, education";IRCAM,IRCAM,IRCAM,IRCAM,IRCAM;facility, facility, facility, facility, facility;FRA, FRA, FRA, FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-68.33785;-4.4933643
"Shunit Haviv Hakimi;Nadav Bhonker;Ran El-Yaniv";BebopNet: Deep neural models for personalized jazz improvisations;2020;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245562;A major bottleneck in the evaluation of music generation is that music appreciation is a highly subjective matter. When considering an average appreciation as an evaluation metric, user studies can be helpful. The challenge of generating personalized content, however, has been examined only rarely in the literature. In this paper, we address generation of personalized music and propose a novel pipeline for music generation that learns and optimizes user-specific musical taste. We focus on the task of symbol-based, monophonic, harmony-constrained jazz improvisations. Our personalization pipeline begins with BebopNet, a music language model trained on a corpus of jazz improvisations by Bebop giants. BebopNet is able to generate improvisations based on any given chord progression. We then assemble a personalized dataset, labeled by a specific user, and train a user-specific metric that reflects this user's unique musical taste. Finally, we employ a personalized variant of beam-search with BebopNet to optimize the generated jazz improvisations for that user. We present an extensive empirical study in which we apply this pipeline to extract individual models as implicitly defined by several human listeners. Our approach enables an objective examination of subjective personalized models whose performance is quantifiable. The results indicate that it is possible to model and optimize personal jazz preferences and offer a foundation for future research in personalized generation of art.

Recent re-search has attempted to develop objective methods based on automated similarity algorithms, but there remains almost no data on the role of perceived similarity in mu-sic copyright decisions despite its crucial role in copy-right law. We collected perceptual data from 20 partici-pants for 17 adjudicated copyright cases from the USA and Japan after editing the disputed sections to contain either full audio, melody only, or lyrics only. Due to the historical emphasis in legal opinions on melody as the key criterion for deciding infringement, we predicted that listening to melody-only versions would result in percep-tual judgements that more closely matched actual past legal decisions. Surprisingly, however, we found no sig-nificant differences between the three conditions, with participants matching past decisions in between 50-60% of cases in all three conditions. Automated algorithms designed to calculate melodic and audio similarity pro-duced comparable results: both algorithms were able to match past decisions with identical accuracy of 71% (12/17 cases). Analysis of cases that were difficult to classify suggests that melody, lyrics, and other factors sometimes interact in complex ways difficult to capture using quantitative metrics. We propose directions for fur-ther investigation of the role of similarity in music copy-right law using larger and more diverse samples of cases and enhanced methods, and adapting our perceptual ex-periment method to avoid relying for ground truth data only on court decisions (which may be subject to selec-tion bias).

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a solution to alleviate the issue by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose an SSL method using teacher-student models for vocal melody extraction. The teacher model is pre-trained with labeled data and guides the student model to make identical predictions given unlabeled input in a self-training setting. We examine three setups of teacher-student models with different data augmentation schemes and loss functions. Also, considering the scarcity of labeled data in the test phase, we artificially generate large-scale testing data with pitch labels from unlabeled data using an analysis-synthesis method. The results show that the SSL method significantly increases the performance against supervised learning only and the improvement depends on the teacher-student models, the size of unlabeled data, the number of self-training iterations, and other training details. We also find that it is essential to ensure that the unlabeled audio has vocal parts.

Two central methods for representation learning include deep metric learning and classification, both having the same goal of learning a representation that can generalize well across tasks. Along with generalization, the emerging concept of disentangled representations is also of great interest, where multiple semantic concepts (e.g., genre, mood, instrumentation) are learned jointly but remain separable in the learned representation space. In this paper we present a single representation learning framework that elucidates the relationship between metric learning, classification, and disentanglement in a holistic manner. For this, we (1) outline past work on the relationship between metric learning and classification, (2) extend this relationship to multi-label data by exploring three different learning approaches and their disentangled versions, and (3) evaluate all models on four tasks (training time, similarity retrieval, auto-tagging, and triplet prediction). We find that classification-based models are generally advantageous for training time, similarity retrieval, and auto-tagging, while deep metric learning exhibits better performance for triplet-prediction.

As a DJ mix is produced in a studio or the live version is recorded for music streaming services, computational methods to analyze DJ mixes, for example, extracting track information or understanding DJ techniques, have drawn research interests. Many of previous works are, however, limited to identifying individual tracks in a mix or segmenting it, and the sizes of the datasets are usually small. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of DJ music by aligning a mix to its original music tracks. We set up the subsequence alignment such that the audio features are less sensitive to the tempo or key change of the original track in a mix. This approach provides temporally tight mix-to-track matching from which we can obtain cue-points, transition length, mix segmentation, and musical changes in DJ performance.

The majority of them, however, use separate neural networks for each note state, thereby optimizing multiple loss functions, and also they handle the temporal evolution of note states by abstract connections between the state-wise neural networks or using a post-processing module. In this paper, we propose a unified neural network architecture where multiple note states are predicted as a softmax output with a single loss function and the temporal order is learned by an auto-regressive connection within the single neural network. This compact model allows to increase note states without architectural complexity. Using the MAESTRO dataset, we examine various combinations of multiple note states including on, onset, sustain, re-onset, offset, and off.

We implement U-nets based on these blocks and train them on complex-valued spectrograms to consider both magnitude and phase. These networks are then compared on the SDR metric.

A basic approach to this task is to train a recurrent neural network (e.g., long short-term memory (LSTM) network) that directly predicts section labels from acoustic features. This approach, however, suffers from frequent musically unnatural label switching because the homogeneity, repetitiveness, and duration regularity of musical sections are hard to represent explicitly in the network architecture. To solve this problem, we formulate a unified hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) that represents the generative process of homogeneous mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients, repetitive chroma features, and mel spectra from section labels, where the emission probabilities of mel spectra are computed from the posterior probabilities of section labels predicted by an LSTM. Given these acoustic features, the most likely label sequence can be estimated with Viterbi decoding. The experimental results show that the proposed LSTM-HSMM hybrid model outperformed a conventional HSMM.;"Go Shibata, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan, education;Ryo Nishikimi, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan, education;Kazuyoshi Yoshii, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan, education";Kyoto University, Kyoto University, Kyoto University;education, education, education;JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;3.4276052;7.5152864

The content of each individual file and the differences between them can then be described in relation to this shared structure. We first construct a large similarity graph of temporal segments, such as beats or bars, based on self-alignments and selected pair-wise alignments between the given input files. Part of this graph is then partitioned into groups of corresponding segments using multiple sequence alignment. This partitioned graph is searched for recurring sections which can be organized hierarchically based on their co-occurrence. We apply our approach to discover shared harmonic structure in a dataset containing a large number of different live performances of a number of songs.

"Matan Gover;Philippe Depalle";Score-informed source separation of choral music;2020;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245412;Choral music recordings are a particularly challenging target for source separation due to the choral blend and the inherent acoustical complexity of the 'choral timbre'. Due to the scarcity of publicly available multi-track choir recordings, we create a dataset of synthesized Bach chorales. We apply data augmentation to alter the chorales so that they more faithfully represent music from a broader range of choral genres. For separation we employ Wave-U-Net, a time-domain convolutional neural network (CNN) originally proposed for vocals and accompaniment separation. We show that Wave-U-Net outperforms a baseline implemented using score-informed NMF (non-negative matrix factorization). We introduce score-informed Wave-U-Net to incorporate the musical score into the separation process. We experiment with different score conditioning methods and show that conditioning on the score leads to improved separation results. We propose a 'score-guided' model variant in which separation is guided by the score alone, bypassing the need to specify the identity of the extracted source. Finally, we evaluate our models (trained on synthetic data only) on real choir recordings and find that in the absence of a large training set of real recordings, NMF still performs better than Wave-U-Net in this setting.

"Fabrizio Pedersoli;Masataka Goto";Dance beat tracking from visual information alone;2020;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245456;We propose and explore the novel task of dance beat tracking, which can be regarded as a fundamental topic in the Dance Information Retrieval (DIR) research field. Dance beat tracking aims at detecting musical beats from a dance video by using its visual information without using its audio information (i.e., dance music). The visual analysis of dances is important to achieve general machine understanding of dances, not limited to dance music. As a sub-area of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) research, DIR also shares similar goals with MIR and needs to extract various high-level semantics from dance videos. While audio-based beat tracking has been thoroughly studied in MIR, there has not been visual-based beat tracking for dance videos.We approach dance beat tracking as a time series classification problem and conduct several experiments using a Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TCN) using the AIST Dance Video Database. We evaluate the proposed solution considering different data splits based on either dancer or music. Moreover, we propose a periodicity-based loss that considerably improves the overall beat tracking performance according to several evaluation metrics.;"Fabrizio Pedersoli, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;facility, facility;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;57.119324;4.3418303
"Kento Watanabe;Masataka Goto";A chorus-section detection method for lyrics text;2020;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245442;"This paper addresses the novel task of detecting chorus sections in English and Japanese lyrics text. Although chorus-section detection using audio signals has been studied, whether chorus sections can be detected from text-only lyrics is an open issue. Another open issue is whether patterns of repeating lyric lines such as those appearing in chorus sections depend on language. To investigate these issues, we propose a neural network-based model for sequence labeling. It can learn phrase repetition and linguistic features to detect chorus sections in lyrics text. It is, however, difficult to train this model since there was no dataset of lyrics with chorus-section annotations as there was no prior work on this task. We therefore generate a large amount of training data with such annotations by leveraging pairs of musical audio signals and their corresponding manually time-aligned lyrics; we first automatically detect chorus sections from the audio signals and then use their temporal positions to transfer them to the line-level chorus-section annotations for the lyrics. Experimental results show that the proposed model with the generated data contributes to detecting the chorus sections, that the model trained on Japanese lyrics can detect chorus sections surprisingly well in English lyrics and that patterns of repeating lyric lines are language-independent.";"Kento Watanabe, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;facility, facility;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;2.5645058;44.422256

Although the latent vectors represent the characteristics of artists and songs well, they have typically been used only for computing the preference score. In this paper, we discuss how we can leverage these vectors for realizing applications that enable users to search for songs from new perspectives. To this end, by embedding song/artist vectors into the same feature space, we first propose two concepts of artist-song relationships: overall similarity and prominent affinity. Overall similarity is the degree to which the characteristics of a song are similar overall to the characteristics of the artist; while prominent affinity is the degree to which a song prominently represents the characteristics of the artist. By using Last.fm play logs for two years, we analyze the characteristics of the concepts. Moreover, based on the analysis results, we propose three applications for song search. Through case studies, we demonstrate that our proposed applications are beneficial for searching for songs according to the users' various search intents.";"Kosetsu Tsukuda, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;facility, facility;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-13.5161;22.209555

Moreover, the model endeavors to incorporate structural events present in the Weimar Jazz Database (WJazzD) for inducing structures in the generated music.

We therefore go one step further and conduct a series of computational analysis of the generated compositions from different perspectives. This includes analyzing the statistics of the pitch class, grooving, and chord progression, assessing the structureness of the music with the help of the fitness scape plot, and evaluating the model's understanding of Jazz music through a MIREX-like continuation prediction task.

This preference-based judgment rank-ordering method is called Best-Worst Scaling (BWS). Inspired by this concept, we propose a preference-based framework to generate a relative rank-ordering of singing vocals, and therefore, singers. We adopt a twin-neural network (Siamese) that learns to choose a preferred candidate in terms of singing quality between two inputs. With a few such pairwise comparisons, this method generates a relative rank-order of a complete list of singers. Additionally, we incorporate a knowledge-based musically-relevant pitch histogram representation, as a conditioning vector, to provide explicit musical information to the network. The experiments show that this method is able to reliably evaluate singing quality and rank-order singing vocals, independent of the song or the singer. The results suggest that the twin-neural network learns the underlying discerning properties relevant to singing quality, instead of being specific to the content of a song or singer.;"Chitralekha Gupta, National University of Singapore, SGP, education;Lin Huang, National University of Singapore, SGP, education;Haizhou Li, National University of Singapore, SGP, education, University of Bremen, DEU, education";National University of Singapore, National University of Singapore, National University of Singapore;education, education, education;SGP, SGP, SGP;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;37.196987;-11.717574

The main body of the dataset contains the vocal melody, the lead instrument melody, and the piano accompaniment for each song in MIDI format, which are aligned to the original audio files.

Ragtime music is distinguished from other musical genres by frequent use of syncopation, and previous computational studies have confirmed a number of musicological hypotheses regarding the use of syncopated patterns in ragtime compositions.

Specifically, we introduce a new methodological framework for processing the RAG-C dataset and confirm that experiments from previous studies obtain similar results using the new methodology. We investigate the use of the common ``short-long-short'' syncopated pattern in different time periods and present new results detailing its use by three well-known ragtime composers. We describe how the use of other syncopated patterns has evolved over time and the different distributions of patterns that result from those changes.

Given these difficulties, it is not easy to learn good feature representations with supervised learning techniques, either because of the insufficiency of labels, or the subjectiveness (and hence large variance) in human-annotated labels. In this paper, we present a framework that can learn high-level feature representations with a limited amount of data, by first modelling their corresponding quantifiable low-level attributes. We refer to our proposed framework as Music FaderNets, which is inspired by the fact that low-level attributes can be continuously manipulated by separate sliding faders through feature disentanglement and latent regularization techniques. High-level features are then inferred from the low-level representations through semi-supervised clustering using Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders (GM-VAEs). Using arousal as an example of a high-level feature, we show that the faders of our model are disentangled and change linearly w.r.t. the modelled low-level attributes of the generated output music. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model successfully learns the intrinsic relationship between arousal and its corresponding low-level attributes (rhythm and note density), with only 1% of the training set being labelled. Finally, using the learnt high-level feature representations, we explore the application of our framework in style transfer tasks across different arousal states.

In this paper, we propose a framework that achieves unsupervised pitch and timbre disentanglement for isolated musical instrument sounds without relying on data annotations or pre-trained neural networks. Our framework, based on variational auto-encoders, takes as input a spectral frame, and encodes pitch and timbre as categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The input is then reconstructed by combining those variables. Under an unsupervised training setting, a major challenge is that encoders are tasked to capture factors of interest with distinct latent representations, without access to the corresponding ground-truth labels. We therefore introduce auxiliary tasks and objectives which leverage pitch shifting as a strategy to create surrogate labels, thereby encouraging the disentanglement of pitch and timbre. Through an ablation study we analyze the impact of the proposed objectives.

"Javier Nistal;Stefan Lattner;Gaël Richard";DrumGAN: Synthesis of drum sounds with timbral feature conditioning using generative adversarial networks;2020;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245504;Synthetic creation of drum sounds (e.g., in drum machines) is commonly performed using analog or digital synthesis, allowing a musician to sculpt the desired timbre modifying various parameters. Typically, such parameters control low-level features of the sound and often have no musical meaning or perceptual correspondence. With the rise of Deep Learning, data-driven processing of audio emerges as an alternative to traditional signal processing. This new paradigm allows controlling the synthesis process through learned high-level features or by conditioning a model on musically relevant information. In this paper, we apply a Generative Adversarial Network to the task of audio synthesis of drum sounds. By conditioning the model on perceptual features computed with a publicly available feature-extractor, intuitive control is gained over the generation process. The experiments are carried out on a large collection of kick, snare, and cymbal sounds. We show that, compared to a specific prior work based on a U-Net architecture, our approach considerably improves the quality of the generated drum samples, and that the conditional input indeed shapes the perceptual characteristics of the sounds. Also, we provide audio examples and release the code used in our experiments.;"Javier Nistal, Sony CSL, FRA, company;Stefan Lattner, Sony CSL, FRA, company;Gaël Richard, LTCI, Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, FRA, education";Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Telecom ParisTech;company, company, education;FRA, FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;48.438164;-29.373264

However, these systems may not be able to fulfill ambiguous requests in a manner that matches the user need. In this work, we study an example of ambiguous requests which we term as non-specific queries (NSQs), such as play music, where users ask to stream content using a single utterance that does not specify what content they want to hear. To better understand user motivations for making NSQs, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with voice users. We observed four themes that structure user perceptions of the benefits and shortcomings of making NSQs: the tradeoff between control and convenience, varying expectations for personalization, the effects of context on expectations, and learned user behaviors. We conclude with implications for how these themes can inform the interaction design of voice search systems in handling non-specific music requests in voice search systems.;"Jennifer Thom, Spotify, USA, company;Angela Nazarian, University of California, Davis, USA, education;Ruth Brillman, Spotify, USA, company;Henriette Cramer, Spotify, USA, company;Sarah Mennicken, Spotify, USA, company";Spotify, University of California Davis, Spotify, Spotify, Spotify;company, education, company, company, company;SWE, USA, SWE, SWE, SWE;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-20.042057;20.214857

However, whether such algorithms apply equally well to compose guitar tabs, which are quite different from MIDIs, remain relatively unexplored. To address this, we build a model for composing fingerstyle guitar tabs with a neural sequence model architecture called the Transformer-XL. With this model, we investigate the following research questions. First, whether the neural net generates note sequences with meaningful fingering (i.e., string-fret combinations), which is important for tabs but not for MIDIs. Second, whether it generates compositions with coherent rhythmic grooving, which is crucial for fingerstyle guitar music. And, finally, how pleasant the composed music is in comparison to real, human-made compositions.

How open data reveals unexpected behavior of high-level music descriptors;2020;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245414;Copyright restrictions prevent the widespread sharing of commercial music audio. Therefore, the availability of resharable pre-computed music audio features has become critical. In line with this, the AcousticBrainz platform offers a dynamically growing, open and community-contributed large-scale resource of locally computed low-level and high-level music descriptors. Beyond enabling research reuse, the availability of such an open resource allows for renewed reflection on the music descriptors we have at hand: while they were validated to perform successfully under lab conditions, they now are being run 'in the wild'. Their response to these more ecological conditions can shed light on the degree to which they truly had construct validity. In this work, we seek to gain further understanding into this, by analyzing high-level classifier-based music descriptor output in AcousticBrainz. While no hard ground truth is available on what the true value of these descriptors should be, some oracle information can still be derived, relying on semantic redundancies between several descriptors, and multiple feature submissions being available for the same recording. We report on multiple unexpected patterns found in the data, indicating that the descriptor values should not be taken as absolute truth, and hinting at directions for more comprehensive descriptor testing that are overlooked in common machine learning evaluation and quality assurance setups.;"Cynthia C.

Research on human computation has shown the effectiveness of crowdsourcing for scaling out human work by defining a large number of microtasks which can easily be distributed and executed. However, microtask design for music transcription is a research area that remains unaddressed. This paper focuses on the design of a crowdsourcing task to detect errors in a score transcription which can be deployed in either automated or human-driven transcription workflows. We conduct an experiment where we study two design parameters: 1) the size of the score to be annotated and 2) the modality in which it is presented in the user interface. We analyze the performance and reliability of non-specialised crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk with respect to these design parameters, differentiated by worker experience and types of transcription errors.

Various auto-tagging models and datasets have been proposed for the automatic music annotation with tags.

In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a user-aware music auto-tagging system and evaluation protocol. Specifically, we use both the audio content and user information extracted from the user listening history to predict contextual tags for a given user/track pair. We propose a new dataset of music tracks annotated with contextual tags per user. We compare our model to the traditional audio-based model and study the influence of user embeddings on the classification quality.

Music genres are valuable information, especially for music organization, personalized listening experience, and playlist generation. Automatically classifying music genres is a challenging endeavor due to the inherent ambiguity and subjectivity. Most efforts on music genre classification consider the complete independence between labels. However, music genres typically respect a hierarchical structure based on the influences or origins of each style. Conversely, many of the methods available for hierarchical classification are based on assumptions about the class hierarchy, such as the need for multiple children in each hierarchy's node, which may limit their use in music applications. Also, the local classifier per node approach that would be the most suitable for this scenario is costly regarding time and memory. In this paper, we present two local hierarchical classification approaches and show how to combine them to obtain a single one that is more robust and faithful to the music genre classification scenario. We evaluate our proposal in a music dataset hierarchically labeled with 120 music genres. As shown, compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our approach has a lower computational cost and can achieve competitive performances.;"Antonio R. S.

The most commonly practiced setting for choir ensembles consists of four parts; Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass (SATB), each with its own range of fundamental frequencies (F0s). The task of source separation for this choral setting entails separating the SATB mixture into the constituent parts. Source separation for musical mixtures is well studied and many deep learning based methodologies have been proposed for the same. However, most of the research has been focused on a typical case which consists in separating vocal, percussion and bass sources from a mixture, each of which has a distinct spectral structure. In contrast, the simultaneous and harmonic nature of ensemble singing leads to high structural similarity and overlap between the spectral components of the sources in a choral mixture, making source separation for choirs a harder task than the typical case. This, along with the lack of an appropriate consolidated dataset has led to a dearth of research in the field so far. In this paper we first assess how well some of the recently developed methodologies for musical source separation perform for the case of SATB choirs. We then propose a novel domain-specific adaptation for conditioning the recently proposed U-Net architecture for musical source separation using the fundamental frequency contour of each of the singing groups and demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses results from domain-agnostic architectures.";"Darius Petermann, Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, ESP, education;Pritish Chandna, Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, ESP, education;Helena Cuesta, Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, ESP, education;Jordi Bonada, Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, ESP, education;Emilia Gómez, European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Seville, ESP, facility";Universitat Pompeu Fabra,Universitat Pompeu Fabra,Universitat Pompeu Fabra,Universitat Pompeu Fabra, European Commission Joint Research Centre;education, education, education, education, facility;ESP, ESP, ESP, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;44.541862;-23.58239

The present work investigates further on the ability of Nonnegative Tucker Decompositon (NTD) to uncover musical patterns and structure in pop songs in their audio form.Exploiting the fact that NTD tends to express the content of bars as linear combinations of a few patterns, we illustrate the ability of the decomposition to capture and single out repeated motifs in the corresponding compressed space, which can be interpreted from a musical viewpoint. The resulting features also turn out to be efficient for structural segmentation, leading to experimental results on the RWC Pop data set which are potentially challenging state-of-the-art approaches that rely on extensive example-based learning schemes.;"Axel Marmoret, Univ Rennes, Inria, CNRS, IRISA, France, education;Jérémy E.

The automation of this process has been object of study for a long time in the field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR), with a wide variety of proposed solutions. Currently, there is a tendency to use machine learning strategies based on neural networks because of their high performance and flexibility to adapt to different scenarios by changing only the training data. However, most of the recent literature addresses only specific parts of the traditional OMR workflow such as music object detection or symbol classification. In this paper, we progress one step further by proposing a full-page OMR system for Mensural notation scores that consists of simply two processes, which are enough to extract the symbolic music information from a full page. More precisely, our pipeline uses Selectional Auto-Encoders to extract single staff regions, combined with end-to-end staff-level recognition based on Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for retrieving the music notation. The results confirm the adequacy of our method, reporting a successful behavior on two Mensural collections (Capitan and Seils datasets) with a straightforward implementation.;"Francisco J.

"Bas Cornelissen;Willem Zuidema;John Ashley Burgoyne";Mode classification and natural units in plainchant;2020;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245572;Many musics across the world are structured around multiple modes, which hold a middle ground between scales and melodies. We study whether we can classify mode in a corpus of 20,865 medieval plainchant melodies from the Cantus database. We revisit the traditional 'textbook' classification approach (using the final, the range and initial note) as well as the only prior computational study we are aware of, which uses pitch profiles. Both approaches work well, but largely reduce modes to scales and ignore their melodic character. Our main contribution is a model that reaches 93–95% F1 score on mode classification, compared to 86–90% using traditional pitch-based musicological methods. Importantly, it reaches 81–83% even when we discard all absolute pitch information and reduce a melody to its contour. The model uses tf–idf vectors and strongly depends on the choice of units: i.e., how the melody is segmented. If we borrow the syllable or word structure from the lyrics, the model outperforms all of our baselines. This suggests that, like language, music is made up of 'natural' units, in our case between the level of notes and complete phrases, a finding that may well be useful in other musics.;"Bas Cornelissen, Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, University of Amsterdam, NLD, education;Willem Zuidema, Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, University of Amsterdam, NLD, education;John Ashley Burgoyne, Institute for Logic, Language and Computation, University of Amsterdam, NLD, education";University of Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam,University of Amsterdam;education, education, education;NLD, NLD, NLD;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;13.315411;-57.22412

First, we introduce SketchVAE, a novel variational autoencoder that explicitly factorizes rhythm and pitch contour to form the basis of our proposed model. Then we introduce two discriminative architectures, SketchInpainter and SketchConnector, that in conjunction perform the guided music completion, filling in representations for the missing measures conditioned on surrounding context and user-specified snippets. We evaluate SketchNet on a standard dataset of Irish folk music and compare with models from recent works. When used for music completion, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art both in terms of objective metrics and subjective listening tests.

Maracatu percussive music is strongly repetitive, and is played as loud and as fast as possible. Both from an MIR and ethnomusicological perspective this makes a complex musical scene to analyse and interpret. In this paper we focus on the extraction of microtiming profiles towards the longer term goal of understanding how rhythmic performance in Maracatu is used to promote health and well-being. To conduct this analysis we use a set of recordings acquired with contact microphones which minimise the interference between performers. Our analysis reveals that the microtiming profiles differ substantially from those observed in more widely studied South American music. In particular, we highlight the presence of dynamic microtiming profiles as well as the importance of the choice of time-keeper instrument, which dictates how the performances can be understood.

Real-world events play a key role in shaping collective sentiment in a society. As people listen to music daily everywhere in the world, the sentiment of music being listened to can reflect the mood of the listeners and serve as a measure of collective sentiment. However, the exact relationship between real-world events and the sentiment of music being listened to is not clear. Driven by this research gap, we use the unexpected outbreak of COVID-19 as a natural experiment to explore how users' sentiment of music being listened to evolves before and during the outbreak of the pandemic. We employ causal inference approaches on an extended version of the LFM-1b dataset of listening events shared on Last.fm, to examine the impact of the pandemic on the sentiment of music listened to by users in different countries. We find that, after the first COVID-19 case in a country was confirmed, the sentiment of artists users listened to becomes more negative. This negative effect is pronounced for males while females' music emotion is less influenced by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We further find a negative association between the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases and users' music sentiment.

These studies are commonly verified through self-reporting emotion-based surveys. This paper proposes the retention rate as an additional parameter for evaluation. The retention rate is one at which the listener revisits the novel items. The authors hypothesize that when a person listens to novel (i.e., both unfamiliar and interesting) pieces of music, the retention rate will be proportional to the number of times the discovery engine suggests the pieces to her, as long as they remain novel. The authors have tested the hypothesis through a six-week human-subject experiment that simulates a real-world listening environment and a follow-up survey. During the experiment period, each subject received, through Discover Weekly in Spotify, suggestions for novel songs up to three times and provided evaluation. One month after the evaluation experiment, the human-subjects answered whether they had revisited the novel songs. Through the analysis of the response and survey data, the researchers conclude that the more times a listener is exposed to a song during the discovery process, the more likely she is to return to the song.;"Brian Manolovitz, ;Mitsunori Ogihara, University of Miami, USA, education";University of Miami, University of Miami;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-46.198265;36.079556

Both an onset time and an accent time is associated to each state. The systematic inference of the reduced form is formalized. This enables the specification of a rhythmic structural similarity measure on drum patterns, where reduced patterns are compared through alignment. The two-state representation allows a low computational cost alignment, once the complex topological formalization is fully taken into account.

He encouraged program directors to avoid playing songs by women back-to-back and advocated for programming their songs at 13-15% of station playlists. His words sparked debate within the industry and drew attention to growing inequalities on radio and within the genre. The majority of these discussions have centered on US country radio, with limited attention to the growing imbalance on the format in Canada. While country format radio in both countries subscribe to a practice of gender-based programming, Canadian program directors are governed by the federal Broadcasting Act, which regulates dissemination of Canadian content.

Yucong Jiang;Score following with hidden tempo using a switching state-space model;2020;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4245528;A score-following program traces the notes in a musical score during a performance. This capability is essential to many meaningful applications that synchronize audio with a score in an on-line fashion. Existing algorithms often stumble on certain difficult cases, one of which is piano music. This paper presents a new method to tackle such cases. The method treats tempo as a variable rather than a constant (with constraints), allowing the program to adapt to live performance variations. This is first expressed by a Kalman filter model at the note level, and then by an almost equivalent switching state-space model at the audio frame level. The latter contains both discrete and continuous hidden variables, and is computationally intractable. We show how certain reasonable approximations make the computation manageable. This new method is tested on a dataset of 50 piano excerpts. Compared with a previously established state-of-the-art algorithm, the new method shows more stable and accurate results: it reduces fatal score-following errors, and improves accuracy from 65.0% to 69.1%.;"Yucong Jiang, University of Richmond, USA, education;Christopher Raphael, Indiana University Bloomington, USA, education";University of Richmond, Indiana University Bloomington;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;54.540398;16.549515

However, most approaches do not provide any form of interpretable control over musical attributes, such as pitch and rhythm. Obtaining control over the generation process is critically important for its use in real-life creative setups. Nevertheless, this problem remains arduous, as there are no known functions nor differentiable approximations to transform symbolic music with control of musical attributes.In this work, we propose a novel method that enables attributes-aware music transformation from any set of musical annotations, without requiring complicated derivative implementation. By relying on an adversarial confusion criterion on given musical annotations, we force the latent space of a generative model to abstract from these features. Then, reintroducing these features as conditioning to the generative function, we obtain a continuous control over them. To demonstrate our approach, we rely on sets of musical attributes computed by the jSymbolic library as annotations and conduct experiments that show that our method outperforms previous methods in control. Finally, comparing correlations between attributes and the transformed results show that our method can provide explicit control over any continuous or discrete annotation.;"Lisa Kawai, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education;Philippe Esling, IRCAM, FRA, facility;Tatsuya Harada, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education, RIKEN, JPN, facility";University of Tokyo, IRCAM, University of Tokyo;education, facility, education;JPN, FRA, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;9.293058;-12.21007

In this study, we aim to better understand the contextual complexities surrounding music fans through a case study of the group BTS and its fan community, ARMY. In particular, we are interested in discovering factors that influence the interactions of music fans with music services, especially in the current environment where the prevalence of social media and other tools/technologies influences musical enjoyment. Through virtual ethnography and content analysis, we identified four factors that affect music fans' interactions with commercial music services: 1) perception of music genres, 2) participatory fandom, 3) desire for agency and transparency, and 4) importance of non-musical factors.

We used the Q methodology to explore which behaviors and influences are important to CMS users and why.

Through an exploratory user study, we provide a better understanding of how users view the concept of diversity in music recommendations, and how they might optimise levels of intra-list diversity themselves. In our study, 17 participants interacted with and rated the suggestions from two different recommendation systems. One provided static top-7 collaborative filtering recommendations, and the other provided an interactive slider to re-rank these recommendations based on a continuous diversity scale. We also asked participants a series of free-form questions on music discovery and diversity in semi-structured interviews. User-preferred levels of diversity varied widely both within and between subjects. Although most users agreed that diversity is beneficial in music discovery, they also noted a risk of dissatisfaction from too much diversity. A key finding is that preference for diversification was often linked to user mood. Participants also expressed a clear distinction between diversity within existing preferences, and outside of existing preferences. These ideas of inner and outer diversity are not well defined within the bounds of current diversity metrics, and we discuss their implications.;"Kyle Robinson, David R.

For two audio clips with M and N frames, respectively, the most popular approach, dynamic time warping (DTW), has O(MN) requirements in both memory and computation, which is prohibitive for frame-level alignments at reasonable rates. To address this, a variety of memory efficient algorithms exist to approximate the optimal alignment under the DTW cost. To our knowledge, however, no exact algorithms exist that are guaranteed to break the quadratic memory barrier. In this work, we present a divide and conquer algorithm that computes the exact globally optimal DTW alignment using O(M+N) memory. Its runtime is still O(MN), trading off memory for a 2x increase in computation. However, the algorithm can be parallelized up to a factor of min(M, N) with the same memory constraints, so it can still run more efficiently than the textbook version with an adequate GPU. We use our algorithm to compute exact alignments on a collection of orchestral music, which we use as ground truth to benchmark the alignment accuracy of several popular approximate alignment schemes at scales that were not previously possible.;"Christopher J.

One approach for improving the browsing experience is music thumbnailing: the procedure of finding a continuous fragment that can represent the whole musical piece. This paper proposes a human-centred approach to creating thumbnails based on listeners' perception, directly asking listeners to identify the most characteristic fragment. We carried out a user study to assign representativeness scores to multiple fragments from a selection of popular music tracks. To strengthen the results, we performed a replication of the same user study with new participants and a different set of music. Thereafter, we used audio features, the segmentation algorithm, and participants' overall familiarity with the songs to predict representativeness scores.

Three high-level audio characteristics, however, do impact the perceived representativeness of a fragment: Raw Intensity, Melodic Conventionality, and Conventionally of Intensity.

If target musical pieces are always played by particular kinds of musical instruments, a way to obtain piano rolls is to compute the pitchgram (pitch saliency spectrogram) of each musical instrument by using a deep neural network (DNN). However, this approach has a critical limitation that it has no way to deal with musical pieces including undefined musical instruments. To overcome this limitation, we estimate a condensed pitchgram with an existing instrument-independent neural multi-pitch estimator and then separate the pitchgram into a specified number of musical instrument parts with a deep spherical clustering technique. To improve the performance of transcription, we propose a joint spectrogram and pitchgram clustering method based on the timbral and pitch characteristics of musical instruments. The experimental results show that the proposed method can transcribe musical pieces including unknown musical instruments as well as those containing only predefined instruments, at the state-of-the-art transcription accuracy.;"Keitaro Tanaka, Waseda University, JPN, education;Takayuki Nakatsuka, Waseda University, JPN, education;Ryo Nishikimi, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Kazuyoshi Yoshii, Kyoto University, JPN, education;Shigeo Morishima, Waseda Research Institute for Science and Engineering, JPN, facility";Waseda University, Waseda University, Kyoto University, Kyoto University, Waseda Research Institute for Science and Engineering;education, education, education, education, facility;JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;35.79034;-29.250692

These embeddings are typically learned using co-listen data to train a deep neural network, to provide consistent tripletloss distances. Instead of directly using these co-listen–based embeddings, we explore making recommendations based on a second, smaller embedding space of human-intelligible musical attributes. To do this, we use the co-listen–based audio embeddings as inputs to small attribute classifiers, trained on a small hand-labeled dataset. These classifiers map from the original embedding space to a new interpretable attribute coordinate system that provides a more useful distance measure for downstream applications. The attributes and attribute embeddings allow us to provide a search interface and more intelligible recommendations for music curators. We examine the relative performance of these two embedding spaces (the co-listen–audio embedding and the attribute embedding) for the mathematical separation of thematic playlists.

In this paper, we propose a unified framework to solve the voice segregation and melody line identification tasks of symbolic music data. To achieve this, a neural network model is trained to learn note-to-note affinity values directly from their contextual notes, in order to represent a music piece as a weighted undirected graph, with the affinity values being the edge weights. Individual voices or streams are then obtained with spectral clustering over the learned graph. Conditioned on minimal prior knowledge, the framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, and further demonstrates strong advantages on simulated real-world symbolic music data with missing notes and asynchronous chord notes.;"Yo-Wei Hsiao, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, TWN, facility;Li Su, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, TWN, facility";Academia Sinica, Academia Sinica;facility, facility;TWN, TWN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;0.11317399;-12.91013

Musicians can flexibly adapt their string choice, hand position, and finger placement to maximise expressivity and playability when sounding each note. Violin fingerings therefore serve as important guides in ensuring effective performance, especially for inexperienced players. However, fingering annotations are often missing or only partially available on violin sheet music. Here, we propose a model based on the variational autoencoder that generates violin fingering patterns using only pitch and timing information found on the score. Our model leverages limited existing fingering data with the possibility to learn in a semi-supervised manner. Results indicate that fingering annotations generated by our model successfully imitate the style and preferences of a human performer. We further show its significantly improved performance with semi-supervised learning, and demonstrate our model's ability to match the state-of-the-art in violin fingering pattern generation when trained on only half the amount of labelled data.;"Vincent K.M.

With the help of information theory, it can be described as the transition probability of a music sequence modeled as a Markov chain. In this study, we introduce the concept of deriving entropy variations over time, so that the surprise contour of each chord sequence can be extracted. Based on this, we propose a user-controllable framework that uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to harmonize the melody based on the given chord surprise indication. Through explicit conditions, the model can randomly generate various and harmonic chord progressions for a melody, and the Spearman's correlation and p-value significance show that the resulting chord progressions match the given surprise contour quite well.

While existing approaches can only fill in a short segment with a fixed number of notes, or a fixed time span between the past and future contexts, our model can infill a variable number of notes (up to 128) for different time spans. We achieve so with three major technical contributions. First, we adapt XLNet, an autoregressive model originally proposed for unsupervised model pre-training, to music score infilling. Second, we propose a new, musically specialized positional encoding called relative bar encoding that better informs the model of notes' position within the past and future context. Third, to capitalize relative bar encoding, we perform look-ahead onset prediction to predict the onset of a note one time step before predicting the other attributes of the note.

Since the desired granularity of the sections may vary by application, multi-level segmentation produces several levels of segmentation ordered by granularity from one section (the whole song) up to N unique sections, and has proven to be a challenging MIR task. In this work we propose a multi-level segmentation method that leverages deep audio embeddings learned via other tasks. Our approach builds on an existing multi-level segmentation algorithm, replacing manually engineered features with deep embeddings learned through audio classification problems where data are abundant. Additionally, we propose a novel section fusion algorithm that leverages the multi-level segmentation to consolidate short segments at each level in a way that is consistent with the segmentations at lower levels. Through a series of experiments we show that replacing handcrafted features with deep embeddings can lead to significant improvements in multi-level music segmentation performance, and that section fusion further improves the results by cleaning up spurious short sections.

In the experiment, we trained several LRID-Nets with varying modality dropout configuration and tested them with various combinations of input modalities. The experiment results demonstrate that using multimodal input improves performance. The results also suggest that adopting modality dropout does not degrade the performance of the model when there are full modality inputs while enabling the model to handle missing modality cases to some extent.;"Keunwoo Choi, ByteDance, company;Yuxuan Wang, ByteDance, company";ByteDance, ByteDance;company, company;CHN, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;29.105186;-1.6798075

The naive approach of writing one output class for each possible chord is hindered by the combinatorial explosion of the output size (~10 million classes). We can reduce this complexity by several orders of magnitude by treating each label (e.g. key or chord quality) independently. However this has been shown to lead to incoherent output labels. To solve this issue we introduce a modified Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimation (NADE) as the last layer of a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network. The NADE layer ensures that labels related to the same chord are dependently predicted, therefore enforcing coherence. The experiments showcase the advantage of the new model both in automatic chord recognition and functional harmonic analysis compared to the model that does not include NADE as well as State of the Art models.;"Gianluca Micchi, ByteDance, company;Katerina Kosta, ByteDance, company;Gabriele Medeot, ByteDance, company;Pierre Chanquion, ByteDance, company";ByteDance, ByteDance, ByteDance, ByteDance;company, company, company, company;CHN, CHN, CHN, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;29.921926;-58.15445

Hand-crafted audio features such as MFCCs or chromagrams are often used to elicit these patterns. However, with more annotations of section labels (e.g., verse, chorus, bridge) becoming available, one can use supervised feature learning to make these patterns even clearer and improve MSA performance. To this end, we take a supervised metric learning approach: we train a deep neural network to output embeddings that are near each other for two spectrogram inputs if both have the same section type (according to an annotation), and otherwise far apart. We propose a batch sampling scheme to ensure the labels in a training pair are interpreted meaningfully. The trained model extracts features that can be used by existing MSA algorithms.

However, prior works in the audio processing domain mostly use Transformer as a temporal feature aggregator that acts similar to RNNs. In this paper, we propose SpecTNT, a Transformer-based architecture to model both spectral and temporal sequences of an input time-frequency representation. Specifically, we introduce a novel variant of the Transformer-in-Transformer (TNT) architecture. In each SpecTNT block, a spectral Transformer extracts frequency-related features into the frequency class token (FCT) for each frame. Later, the FCTs are linearly projected and added to the temporal embeddings (TEs), which aggregate useful information from the FCTs. Then, a temporal Transformer processes the TEs to exchange information across the time axis. By stacking the SpecTNT blocks, we build the SpecTNT model to learn the representation for music signals.

They typically learn a mapping from a mixture spectrogram to a set of source spectrograms, all with magnitudes only. This approach has several limitations: 1) its incorrect phase reconstruction degrades the performance, 2) it limits the magnitude of masks between 0 and 1 while we observe that 22% of time-frequency bins have ideal ratio mask values of over~1 in a popular dataset, MUSDB18, 3) its potential on very deep architectures is under-explored. Our proposed system is designed to overcome these. First, we propose to estimate phases by estimating complex ideal ratio masks (cIRMs) where we decouple the estimation of cIRMs into magnitude and phase estimations. Second, we extend the separation method to effectively allow the magnitude of the mask to be larger than~1. Finally, we propose a residual UNet architecture with up to 143 layers.

By factoring music generation into sub-problems, our approach allows simpler models and requires less data. To customize or add variety, one can alter chords, basic melody, and rhythm structure in the music frameworks, letting our networks generate the melody accordingly.

Following a carefully constrained set of Deezer users over a 2-year observation period, our work explores factors driving user behaviour in the broad sense, by differentiating users on the basis of their temporal daily usage, adoption of the main platform affordances, and the ways in which they react to them, especially in terms of recommendation adoption. Diverging from a perspective common in studies on the effects of recommendation, we assume and confirm that users exhibit very diverse behaviours in using and adopting the platform affordances.

However, most approaches are based on the estimation of harmonic and melodic features and neglect lyrics information although it is an important invariant across covers. In this work, we propose a novel approach leveraging lyrics without requiring access to full texts though the use of lyrics recognition on audio.

"Christoph Finkensiep;Martin A Rohrmeier";Modeling and Inferring Proto-Voice Structure in Free Polyphony;2021;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5624431;Voice leading is considered to play an important role in the structure of Western tonal music. However, the explicit voice assignment of a piece (if present at all) generally does not reflect all phenomena related to voice leading. Instead, voice-leading phenomena can occur in free textures (e.g., in most keyboard music), or cut across the explicitly notated voices (e.g., through implicit polyphony within a single voice). This paper presents a model of proto-voices, voice-like structures that encode sequential and vertical relations between notes without the need to assume explicit voices. Proto-voices are constructed by recursive combination of primitive structural operations, such as insertion of neighbor or passing notes, or horizontalization of simultaneous notes. Together, these operations give rise to a grammar-like hierarchical system that can be used to infer the structural fabric of a piece using a chart parsing algorithm. Such a model can serve as a foundation for defining higher-level latent entities (such as harmonies or voice-leading schemata), explicitly linking them to their realizations on the musical surface.;"Christoph Finkensiep, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, CHE, education;Martin Rohrmeier, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, CHE, education";École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;education, education;CHE, CHE;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;24.978441;-18.600195

Central to this analysis is the labeling of segments of a piece with chord symbols and local key information. In this work, we propose a modular system for performing such a harmonic analysis, incorporating spelled pitches (i.e., not treating enharmonically equivalent pitches as identical) and using a very large vocabulary of 1540 chords (each with a root, type, and inversion) and 70 keys (with a tonic and mode), leading to a full harmonic characterization similar to Roman numeral analysis. Our system's modular design allows each of its components to model an aspect of harmony at an appropriate level of granularity, and also aids in both flexibility and interpretability. We show that our system improves upon a state-of-the-art model for the task, both on a previously available corpus consisting mostly of pieces from the Classical and Romantic eras of Western music, as well as on a much larger corpus spanning a wider range from the 16th through the 20th centuries.;"Andrew McLeod, EPFL, CHE, education;Martin Rohrmeier, EPFL, CHE, education";École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;education, education;CHE, CHE;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;14.921707;3.9740756

We introduce a workflow paradigm for remote consensus-building between expert annotators, while considerably reducing the associated administrative overhead through automation. Most music annotation tasks rely heavily on human interpretation and therefore defy the concept of an objective and indisputable ground truth. Thus, our paradigm invites and documents inter-annotator controversy based on a transparent set of analytical criteria, and aims at putting forth the consensual solutions emerging from such deliberations. The workflow that we suggest traces the entire genesis of annotation data, including the relevant discussions between annotators, reviewers, and curators. It adopts a well-proven pattern from collaborative software development, namely distributed version control, and allows for the automation of repetitive maintenance tasks, such as validity checks, message dispatch, or updates of metaand paradata. To demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness, we introduce one possible implementation through GitHub Actions and showcase its success in creating cadence, phrase, and harmony annotations for a corpus of 36 trio sonatas by Arcangelo Corelli.

"Martin A Rohrmeier;Fabian C.

Developing from classical major-minor tonality, the harmonic language of extended tonality forms its own set of rules and regularities, which are a result of the freer combinatoriality of chords within phrases, non-standard chord forms, the emancipation of dissonance, and the loosening of the concept of key. These phenomena posit a challenge for formal, mathematical theory building. The theoretical model proposed in this paper proceeds from Neo-Riemannian and Tonfeld theory, a systematic but informal music-theoretical framework for extended tonality. Our model brings together three fundamental components: the underlying algebraic structure of the Tonnetz, the three basic analytical categories from Tonfeld theory (octatonic and hexatonic collections as well as stacks of fifths), and harmonic syntax in terms of formal language theory. The proposed model is specified to a level of detail that lends itself for implementation and empirical investigation.;"Martin Rohrmeier, Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab, EPFL, CHE, facility;Fabian C.

The wide-ranging consequences of reflexivity on the future of scholarly inquiry combined with the near-universal contemporary recognition of the need to broaden the scope of MIR research invite and merit critical attention. To that end, focusing primarily on twelve-tone equal-tempered pitch and dyadic rhythm models, we explore the practical, cultural, perceptual, historical, and epistemological consequences of these pervasive quantizations.

However, most models are only applicable to short-term music, while learning long-term music representations remains a challenging task. We have seen several studies attempting to learn hierarchical representations directly in an end-to-end manner, but these models have not been able to achieve the desired results and the training process is not stable. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn long-term symbolic music representations through contextual constraints. First, we use contrastive learning to pre-train a long-term representation by constraining its difference from the short-term representation (extracted by an off-the-shelf model). Then, we fine-tune the long-term representation by a hierarchical prediction model such that a good long-term representation (e.g., an 8-bar representation) can reconstruct the corresponding short-term ones (e.g., the 2-bar representations within the 8-bar range). Experiments show that our method stabilizes the training and the fine-tuning steps. In addition, the designed contextual constraints benefit both reconstruction and disentanglement, significantly outperforming the baselines.</p>;"Shiqi Wei, School of Data Science, Fudan University, CHN, education;Gus Xia, Music X Lab, Computer Science Department, New York University Shanghai, CHN, education";Fudan University, New York University Shanghai;education, education;CHN, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;6.1243944;-9.958965

On Latent Representations for Controllable Music Generation;2021;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5624591;Improving controllability or the ability to manipulate one or more attributes of the generated data has become a topic of interest in the context of deep generative models of music. Recent attempts in this direction have relied on learning disentangled representations from data such that the underlying factors of variation are well separated. In this paper, we focus on the relationship between disentanglement and controllability by conducting a systematic study using different supervised disentanglement learning algorithms based on the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) architecture. Our experiments show that a high degree of disentanglement can be achieved by using different forms of supervision to train a strong discriminative encoder. However, in the absence of a strong generative decoder, disentanglement does not necessarily imply controllability. The structure of the latent space with respect to the VAE-decoder plays an important role in boosting the ability of a generative model to manipulate different attributes. To this end, we also propose methods and metrics to help evaluate the quality of a latent space with respect to the afforded degree of controllability.;"Ashis Pati, Center for Music Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, education;Alexander Lerch, Center for Music Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, education";Georgia Institute of Technology,Georgia Institute of Technology;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-1.2418482;-22.671762

We expand upon previous work in three ways. First, we explore several musically motivated data augmentation schemes based on pitch-shifting and random removal of individual notes or groups of notes. We show that these augmentation schemes lead to dramatic improvements in model performance, of a magnitude that exceeds the benefit of pretraining on all solo piano sheet music images in IMSLP.

Third, we explore the performance of trained models in a 1-shot learning context, in which the model performs classification among a set of composers that are unseen in training.

We focus on the main technical challenge of aligning the individual part recordings against a reference ``full mix'' recording containing a performance of the work. We propose an iterative subtractive alignment approach, in which each part recording is aligned against the full mix recording and then subtracted from it. We also explore different feature representations and cost metrics to handle the asymmetrical nature of the part--full mix comparison.

We re-examine current best practices for large-scale sheet music retrieval through an economics perspective. In our analogy, the runtime search is like a consumer shopping in a store. The items on the shelves correspond to fingerprints, and purchasing an item corresponds to doing a fingerprint lookup in the database. From this perspective, we show that previous approaches are extremely inefficient marketplaces in which the consumer has very few choices and adopts an irrational buying strategy. The main contribution of this work is to propose a novel fingerprinting scheme called marketplace fingerprinting. This approach redesigns the system to be an efficient marketplace in which the consumer has many options and adopts a rational buying strategy that explicitly considers the cost and expected utility of each item. We also show that deciding which fingerprints to include in the database poses a type of minimax problem in which the store and the consumer have competing interests. On experiments using all solo piano sheet music images in IMSLP as a searchable database, we show that marketplace fingerprinting substantially outperforms previous approaches and achieves a mean reciprocal rank of 0.905 with sub-second average runtime.;"Kevin Ji, Harvey Mudd College, USA, education;Daniel Yang, Harvey Mudd College, USA, education;TJ Tsai, Harvey Mudd College, USA, education";Harvey Mudd College, Harvey Mudd College, Harvey Mudd College;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-7.9251513;-43.76336

"Simon J Schwär;Sebastian Rosenzweig;Meinard Müller";A Differentiable Cost Measure for Intonation Processing in Polyphonic Music;2021;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5624601;Intonation is the process of choosing an appropriate pitch for a given note in a musical performance. Particularly in polyphonic singing, where all musicians can continuously adapt their pitch, this leads to complex interactions. To achieve an overall balanced sound, the musicians dynamically adjust their intonation considering musical, perceptual, and acoustical aspects. When adapting the intonation in a recorded performance, a sound engineer may have to individually fine-tune the pitches of all voices to account for these aspects in a similar way. In this paper, we formulate intonation adaptation as a cost minimization problem. As our main contribution, we introduce a differentiable cost measure by adapting and combining existing principles for measuring intonation. In particular, our measure consists of two terms, representing a tonal aspect (the proximity to a tonal grid) and a harmonic aspect (the perceptual dissonance between salient frequencies). We show that, combining these two aspects, our measure can be used to flexibly account for different artistic intents while allowing for robust and joint processing of multiple voices in real-time. In an experiment, we demonstrate the potential of our approach for the task of intonation adaptation of amateur choral music using recordings from a publicly available multitrack dataset.;"Simon Schwär, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility;Sebastian Rosenzweig, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility;Meinard Müller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility";International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen;facility, facility, facility;DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;23.400465;-9.216449

Traditional chroma features relying on signal processing are often influenced by timbral properties such as overtones or vibrato and, thus, only roughly correspond to the pitch classes indicated by a score. Deep learning provides a promising possibility to overcome such problems but requires large annotated datasets. Previous approaches therefore use either synthetic audio, MIDI-piano recordings, or chord annotations for training. Since these strategies have different limitations, we propose to learn transcription-like pitch-class representations using pre-synchronized score-audio pairs of classical music. We train several CNNs with musically inspired architectures and evaluate their pitch-class estimates for various instrumentations including orchestra, piano, chamber music, and singing. Moreover, we illustrate the learned features' behavior when used as input to a chord recognition system. In all our experiments, we compare cross-validation with cross-dataset evaluation.

Protection mechanisms in digital audio processing tools have not eliminated the need of production entities located downstream the distribution chain to assess audio quality and detect defects inserted further upstream. Such analysis often relies on the received audio and scarce meta-data alone.

The basic idea is to identify a small set of human-understandable features of the classified example that are most influential on the classifier's prediction. These are then presented as an explanation. Evaluation of such explanations in publications often resorts to accepting what matches the expectation of a human without actually being able to verify if what the explanation shows is what really caused the model's prediction. This paper reports on targeted investigations where we try to get more insight into the actual veracity of LIME's explanations in an audio classification task. We deliberately design adversarial examples for the classifier, in a way that gives us knowledge about which parts of the input are potentially responsible for the model's (wrong) prediction.

Yet, despite the advance of computational musicology in analysing other Western repertoires, the use of computer-based methods to automatically retrieve relevant information from Renaissance music, e. g., identifying word-painting strategies such as madrigalisms, is still underdeveloped. To this end, we propose a score-based machine learning approach for the classification of texture in Italian madrigals of the 16th century. Our outcomes indicate that Low Level Descriptors, such as intervals, can successfully convey differences in High Level features, such as texture. Furthermore, our baseline results, particularly the ones from a Convolutional Neural Network, show that machine learning can be successfully used to automatically identify sections in madrigals associated with specific textures from symbolic sources.;"Emilia Parada-Cabaleiro, Multimedia Mining and Search Group, Institute of Computational Perception, JKU Linz, Austria, education, Human-centered AI Group, AI Lab, Linz Institute of Technology (LIT), Austria, education;Maximilian Schmitt, Chair of Embedded Intelligence for Health Care and Wellbeing, University of Augsburg, Germany, education;Anton Batliner, Chair of Embedded Intelligence for Health Care and Wellbeing, University of Augsburg, Germany, education;Björn Schuller, Chair of Embedded Intelligence for Health Care and Wellbeing, University of Augsburg, Germany, education, GLAM – Group on Language, Audio & Music, Imperial College London, UK, education;Markus Schedl, Multimedia Mining and Search Group, Institute of Computational Perception, JKU Linz, Austria, education, Human-centered AI Group, AI Lab, Linz Institute of Technology (LIT), Austria, education";Johannes Kepler University, University of Augsburg, University of Augsburg, University of Augsburg, Johannes Kepler University;education, education, education, education, education;AUT, DEU, DEU, DEU, AUT;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-1.9577056;-54.719036

However, there are still a number of open problems, such as a lack of robustness in the face of severe duration mismatches between audio and lyrics representation; a certain degree of language-specificity caused by acoustic differences across languages; and the fact that most successful methods in the field are not suited to work in real-time. Real-time lyrics alignment (tracking) would have many useful applications, such as fully automated subtitle display in live concerts and opera. In this work, we describe the first real-time-capable audio-to-lyrics alignment pipeline that is able to robustly track the lyrics of different languages, without additional language information. The proposed model predicts, for each audio frame, a probability vector over (European) phoneme classes, using a very small temporal context, and aligns this vector with a phoneme posteriogram matrix computed beforehand from another recording of the same work, which serves as a reference and a proxy to the written-out lyrics. We evaluate our system's tracking accuracy on the challenging genre of classical opera. Finally, robustness to out-of-training languages is demonstrated in an experiment on Jingju (Beijing opera).";"Charles Brazier, Institute of Computational Perception, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria, education, LIT AI Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Austria, education;Gerhard Widmer, Institute of Computational Perception, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria, education, LIT AI Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Austria, education";Johannes Kepler University,Johannes Kepler University;education, education;AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;25.486813;16.599771

In the present work, we analyze several sets of features on their effectiveness in predicting arousal and valence of six different performances (by six famous pianists) of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier Book 1. These features include low-level acoustic features, score-based features, features extracted using a pre-trained emotion model, and Mid-level perceptual features. We compare their predictive power by evaluating them on several experiments designed to test performance-wise or piece-wise variations of emotion. We find that Mid-level features show significant contribution in performance-wise variation of both arousal and valence even better than the pre-trained emotion model. Our findings add to the evidence of Mid-level perceptual features being an important representation of musical attributes for several tasks specifically, in this case, for capturing the expressive aspects of music that manifest as perceived emotion of a musical performance.;"Shreyan Chowdhury, Institute of Computational Perception, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria, education, LIT AI Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Austria, education;Gerhard Widmer, Institute of Computational Perception, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria, education, LIT AI Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Austria, education";Johannes Kepler University,Johannes Kepler University;education, education;AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-33.465214;56.81873

In contrast, in this paper we take a data-driven approach and investigate 704,166 user-generated playlists of a major music streaming provider. In particular, we study the consistency (in terms of variance) of a variety of audio features and metadata between subsequent tracks in playlists, and we relate this variance to the corresponding variance computed on a position-independent set of tracks. Our results show that some features vary on average up to 16% less among subsequent tracks in comparison to position-independent pairs of tracks. Furthermore, we show that even pairs of tracks that lie up to 12 positions apart in the playlist are significantly more consistent in several audio features and genres.

Whereas such movements have been studied using a wide range of methods, only few studies have investigated synchronisation to real music stimuli in a cross-culturally comparative setting. The present study employs beat tracking evaluation metrics and accent histograms to analyze the differences in the ways participants from two cultural groups synchronize their tapping with either familiar or unfamiliar music stimuli. Instead of choosing two apparently remote cultural groups, we selected two groups of musicians that share cultural backgrounds, but that differ regarding the music style they specialize in. The employed method to record tapping responses in audio format facilitates a fine-grained analysis of metrical accents that emerge from the responses. The identified differences between groups are related to the metrical structures inherent to the two musical styles, such as non-isochronicity of the beat, and differences between the groups document the influence of the deep enculturation of participants to their style of expertise.

Whereas estimation of the pitches and onset times of musical notes has been improved drastically thanks to the recent advances of deep learning, estimation of note values and voice labels, which is a crucial component of the APT system, still remains a challenging task. A previous study has revealed that (i) the pitches and onset times of notes are useful but the performed note durations are less informative for estimating the note values and that (ii) the note values and voices have mutual dependency. We thus propose a bidirectional long short-term memory network that jointly estimates note values and voice labels from note pitches and onset times estimated in advance. To improve the robustness against tempo errors, extra notes, and missing notes included in the input data, we investigate data augmentation. The experimental results show the efficacy of multi-task learning and data augmentation, and the proposed method achieved better accuracies than existing methods.;"Yuki Hiramatsu, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan, education;Eita Nakamura, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan, education, The Hakubi Center for Advanced Research, Kyoto University, Japan, facility;Kazuyoshi Yoshii, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan, education, PRESTO, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Japan, facility";Kyoto University, Kyoto University, Kyoto University;education, education, education;JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;5.2909145;-37.214684

The conventional approach to beat estimation is to train a deep neural network (DNN) that estimates the beat presence probability at each frame. This approach, however, relies heavily on a periodicity-aware post-processing step that detects beat times from the noisy probability sequence. To mitigate this problem, we have designed a DNN that estimates the beat phase at each frame whose period is equal to the beat interval. The estimation losses computed at all frames not limited to a fewer number of beat frames can thus be effectively used for backpropagation-based supervised training, whereas a DNN has conventionally been trained such that it constantly outputs zero at all non-beat frames. The same applies to downbeat estimation. We also modify the post-processing method for the estimated phase sequence. For joint beat and downbeat detection, we investigate multi-task learning architectures that output beat and downbeat phases in this order, in reverse order, and in parallel. The experimental results demonstrate the importance of phase modeling for stable beat and downbeat estimation.;"Takehisa Oyama, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan, education;Ryoto Ishizuka, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan, education;Kazuyoshi Yoshii, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan, education, PRESTO, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Japan, facility";Kyoto University, Kyoto University, Kyoto University;education, education, education;JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;54.9056;5.7457166

We created a dataset of 360 recent pop songs drawn from major music charts of the countries and constructed semantically identical mood descriptors across English, Korean, and Portuguese languages. Multiple participants from the three countries rated their familiarity, preference, and perceived moods for a given song. Ratings were highly similar within and across cultures for basic mood attributes such as sad, cheerful, and energetic. However, we found significant cross-cultural differences for more complex characteristics such as dreamy and love. To our surprise, the results of mood detection algorithms were uniformly correlated across human ratings from all three countries and did not show a detectable bias towards any particular culture.

To answer how, we analyze over 23 million lyrics request logs sent from the smartphone application of a music streaming service. Our analysis results suggest several reusable insights, including the following: (1) People have high demand for viewing lyrics to confirm what the artist sings, more deeply understand the lyrics, sing the song, and figure out the structure such as verse and chorus. (2) People like to view lyrics after returning home at night and before going to sleep rather than during the daytime. (3) People usually view the same lyrics repeatedly over time.

This has paved the way for various applications in the area of music informational retrieval (MIR). In this paper, we propose a method to learn a cross-domain embedding space between isolated vocal and mixed audio for vocal-centric MIR tasks, leveraging a pre-trained music source separation model. Learning the cross-domain embedding was previously attempted with a triplet-based similarity model where vocal and mixed audio are encoded by two different convolutional neural networks. We improve the approach with a structure-preserving triplet loss that exploits not only cross-domain similarity between vocal and mixed audio but also intra-domain similarity within vocal tracks or mix tracks.

The model is inspired by the fact that when humans listen to music, our minds can not only separate the sounds of different instruments, but also at the same time perceive high-level representations such as score and timbre. To mirror such capability computationally, we designed a pitch-timbre disentanglement module based on a popular encoder-decoder neural architecture for source separation. The key inductive biases are vector-quantization for pitch representation and pitch-transformation invariant for timbre representation. In addition, we adopted a query-by-example method to achieve zero-shot&nbsp;learning, i.e., the model is capable of doing source separation, transcription, and synthesis for unseen&nbsp;instruments. The current design focuses on audio mixtures of two monophonic instruments.

"Jingwei Zhao;Gus Xia";AccoMontage: Accompaniment Arrangement via Phrase Selection and Style Transfer;2021;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5625706;Accompaniment arrangement is a difficult music generation task involving intertwined constraints of melody, harmony, texture, and music structure. Existing models are not yet able to capture all these constraints effectively, especially for long-term music generation. To address this problem, we propose AccoMontage, an accompaniment arrangement system for whole pieces of music through unifying phrase selection and neural style transfer. We focus on generating piano accompaniments for folk/pop songs based on a lead sheet (i.e., melody with chord progression). Specifically, AccoMontage first retrieves phrase montages from a database while recombining them structurally using dynamic programming. Second, chords of the retrieved phrases are manipulated to match the lead sheet via style transfer. Lastly, the system offers controls over the generation process. In contrast to pure learning-based approaches, AccoMontage introduces a novel hybrid pathway, in which rule-based optimization and deep learning are both leveraged to complement each other for high-quality generation. Experiments show that our model generates well-structured accompaniment with delicate texture, significantly outperforming the baselines.;"Jingwei Zhao, Music X Lab, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education;Gus Xia, Music X Lab, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education";New York University Shanghai, New York University Shanghai;education, education;CHN, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;-7.297551;-25.135126

In this work, we exploit hierarchical relationships between instruments in a few-shot learning setup to enable classification of a wider set of musical instruments, given a few examples at inference. We apply a hierarchical loss function to the training of prototypical networks, combined with a method to aggregate prototypes hierarchically, mirroring the structure of a predefined musical instrument hierarchy.

For this task, to ensure the relevance of generated samples and training music, we present a novel pitch-group representation. SinTra, consisting of a pyramid of Transformer-XL with a multi-scale training strategy, can learn both the musical structure and the relative positional relationship between notes of the single training music segment. Additionally, for maintaining the inter-track correlation, we use the convolution operation to process multi-track music, and when decoding, the tracks are independent to each other to prevent interference. We evaluate SinTra with both subjective study and objective metrics. The comparison results show that our framework can learn information from a single music segment more sufficiently than Music Transformer.

Zhengshan Shi;Computational analysis and modeling of expressive timing in Chopin's Mazurkas;2021;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5624515;Performers' distortion of notated rhythms in a musical score is a significant factor in the production of convincingly expressive music interpretations. Sometimes exaggerated, and sometimes subtle, these distortions are driven by a variety of factors, including schematic features (both structural such as phrase boundaries and surface events such as recurrent rhythmic patterns), as well as relatively rare veridical events that characterize the individuality and uniqueness of a particular piece. Performers tend to adopt similar pervasive approaches to interpreting schemas, resulting in common performance practices, while often formulating less common approaches to the interpretation of veridical events. Furthermore, some performers choose anomalous interpretations of schemas. We present a machine learning model of expressive performance of Chopin Mazurkas and a critical analysis of the output based upon statistical analyses of the musical scores and of recorded performances. We compare the timings of recorded human performances of selected Mazurkas by Frédéric Chopin with performances of the same works generated by a neural network trained with recorded human performances of the entire corpus.

To determine if Jukebox's representations contain useful information for MIR, we use them as input features to train shallow models on several MIR tasks. Relative to representations from conventional MIR models which are pre-trained on tagging, we find that using representations from Jukebox as input features yields 30% stronger performance on average across four MIR tasks: tagging, genre classification, emotion recognition, and key detection. For key detection, we observe that representations from Jukebox are considerably stronger than those from models pre-trained on tagging, suggesting that pre-training via codified audio language modeling may address blind spots in conventional approaches.

However, making them operable with semantically meaningful controls remains an open challenge. An obvious approach is to control the GAN by conditioning it on metadata contained in audio datasets. Unfortunately, audio datasets often lack the desired annotations, especially in the musical domain. A way to circumvent this lack of annotations is to generate them, for example, with an automatic audio-tagging system. The output probabilities of such systems (so-called soft labels) carry rich information about the characteristics of the respective audios and can be used to distill the knowledge from a teacher model into a student model. In this work, we perform knowledge distillation from a large audio tagging system into an adversarial audio synthesizer that we call DarkGAN. Results show that DarkGAN can synthesize musical audio with acceptable quality and exhibits moderate attribute control even with out-of-distribution input conditioning.

Since traditional chroma variants obtained with signal processing suffer from timbral artifacts such as overtones or vibrato, they do not directly reflect the pitch classes notated in the score. For this reason, training a chroma representation using deep learning (deep chroma) has become an interesting strategy. Existing approaches involve the use of supervised learning with strongly aligned labels for which, however, only few datasets are available. Recently, the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, initially proposed for speech, has been adopted to learn monophonic (single-label) pitch-class features using weakly aligned labels based on corresponding score--audio segment pairs. To exploit this strategy for the polyphonic case, we propose the use of a multi-label variant of this CTC loss, the MCTC, and formalize this loss for the pitch-class scenario. Our experiments demonstrate that the weakly aligned approach achieves almost equivalent pitch-class estimates than training with strongly aligned annotations. We then study the sensitivity of our approach to segment duration and mismatch. Finally, we compare the learned features with other pitch-class representations and demonstrate their use for chord and local key recognition on classical music datasets.;"Christof Weiß, LTCI, Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France, education;Geoffroy Peeters, LTCI, Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France, education";Telecom ParisTech,Telecom ParisTech;education, education;FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;13.87064;-9.420827

We then perform a large-scale analysis of official music-video clips (which we manually annotated into video genres) using MIR description tools (downbeats and functional segments estimation) and Computer Vision tools (shot detection). Our study confirms that a language of music-video clips exists; i.e. editors favor the co-occurrence of music and video events using strategies such as anticipation.

We propose a new task in the symbolic music domain that is similar to the music sampling practice and a neural network model named CollageNet to fulfill this task. Specifically, given a piece of melody and an irrelevant accompaniment with the same length, we fuse them into harmonic two-track music after some necessary changes to the inputs. Besides, users are involved in the fusion process by providing controls to the amount of changes along several disentangled musical aspects: rhythm and pitch of the melody, and chord and texture of the accompaniment. We conduct objective and subjective experiments to demonstrate the validity of our model. Experimental results confirm that our model achieves significantly higher level of harmony than rule-based and data-driven baseline methods. Furthermore, the musicality of each of the tracks does not deteriorate after the transformation applied by CollageNet, which is also superior to the two baselines.;"Abudukelimu Wuerkaixi, Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Tsinghua University (THUAI), State Key Lab of Intelligent Technologies and Systems, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, CHN, education;Christodoulos Benetatos, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, USA, education;Zhiyao Duan, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, USA, education;Changshui Zhang, Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Tsinghua University (THUAI), State Key Lab of Intelligent Technologies and Systems, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, CHN, education";Tsinghua University, University of Rochester, University of Rochester, Tsinghua University;education, education, education, education;CHN, USA, USA, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developing economies;-7.346987;-24.06734

The problem is that the available public datasets are limited either in size or in realism, and are thus suboptimal for training purposes. Indeed, the best results are currently obtained via a rather convoluted multi-step training process that involves both real and synthetic datasets. To address this issue, starting from the observation that the communities of rhythm games players provide a large amount of annotated data, we curated a new dataset of crowdsourced drum transcriptions. This dataset contains real-world music, is manually annotated, and is about two orders of magnitude larger than any other non-synthetic dataset, making it a prime candidate for training purposes. However, due to crowdsourcing, the initial annotations contain mistakes. We discuss how the quality of the dataset can be improved by automatically correcting different types of mistakes. When used to train a popular DTM model, the dataset yields a performance that matches that of the state-of-the-art for DTM, thus demonstrating the quality of the annotations.;"Mickaël Zehren, Umeå Universitet, SWE, education;Marco Alunno, Universidad EAFIT Medellín, COL, education;Paolo Bientinesi, Umeå Universitet, SWE, education";Umeå Universitet, Universidad EAFIT Medellín, Umeå Universitet;education, education, education;SWE, COL, SWE;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developing economies, Developed economies;56.316727;-32.135094

We present a methodology for collecting a 2d beat distribution of period and phase from free beat-tapping data from multiple participants. The methodology allows capturing beat-tapping variability both within (e.g.: mid-track beat change) and between annotators (e.g.: participants tap at different phases). The data analysis methodology was tested with simulated beat tracks assessing robustness to tapping variability, mid-tapping beat change and disagreement between annotators. It was also tested on experimental tapping data where the entropy of the estimated beat distributions correlated with tapping difficulty reported by the participants. For the MIR task, we propose using optimal transport as an evaluation criterion for models that estimate the beat distribution from musical stimuli. This criterion provides better scores to beat estimations closer in phase or period to distributions obtained from data. Finally, we present baseline models for the task of estimating the beat distribution. The methodology is presented with aims to enhance the exploration of ambiguity in the beat percept. For example, it exposes if beat uncertainty is related to a pulse that is hard to produce or conflicting interpretations of the beat.;"Martin A.

We obtained pulse clarity metrics by analyzing periodical behavior from neuron activation values and we interpreted the probability distribution computed by the DBN as the model's certainty. To analyze whether the inner workings of the model provide new insight into pulse clarity, we also proposed reference metrics using the output of both networks. We evaluated the pulse clarity metrics over a wide range of stimulus types such as songs and mono-tonal rhythms, obtaining comparable results to previous models. These results suggest that adapting a model from a related task is feasible for the pulse clarity problem.

Even though the recent Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) architectures have demonstrated its capacity to reliably recognise handwritten text, their performance is still far from satisfactory when applied to historical handwritten scores. Indeed, the ambiguous nature of handwriting, the non-standard musical notation employed by composers of the time and the decaying state of old paper make these scores remarkably difficult to read, sometimes even by trained humans. Thus, in this work we explore the incorporation of language models into a Seq2Seq-based architecture to try to improve transcriptions where the aforementioned unclear writing produces statistically unsound mistakes, which as far as we know, has never been attempted for this field of research on this architecture. After studying various Language Model integration techniques, the experimental evaluation on historical handwritten music scores shows a significant improvement over the state of the art, showing that this is a promising research direction for dealing with such difficult manuscripts.;"Pau Torras, Computer Vision Center, Computer Science Department, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, ESP, education;Arnau Baró, Computer Vision Center, Computer Science Department, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, ESP, education;Lei Kang, Computer Vision Center, Computer Science Department, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, ESP, education;Alicia Fornés, Computer Vision Center, Computer Science Department, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, ESP, education";Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona;education, education, education, education;ESP, ESP, ESP, ESP;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;10.640113;-24.990276

In this paper, our goal is to help creators find music to match the emotion of their story. We focus on text-based stories that can be auralized (e.g., books), use multiple sentences as input queries, and automatically retrieve matching music. We formalize this task as a cross-modal text-to-music retrieval problem. Both the music and text domains have existing datasets with emotion labels, but mismatched emotion vocabularies prevent us from using mood or emotion annotations directly for matching. To address this challenge, we propose and investigate several emotion embedding spaces, both manually defined (e.g., valence/arousal) and data-driven (e.g., Word2Vec and metric learning) to bridge this gap. Our experiments show that by leveraging these embedding spaces, we are able to successfully bridge the gap between modalities to facilitate cross modal retrieval. We show that our method can leverage the well established valence-arousal space, but that it can also achieve our goal via data-driven embedding spaces. By leveraging data-driven embeddings, our approach has the potential of being generalized to other retrieval tasks that require broader or completely different vocabularies.;"Minz Won, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, ESP, education;Justin Salamon, Adobe Research, USA, company;Nicholas J.

Personalized models are trained in a supervised manner, and are tested exclusively with the annotations provided by a specific user.

We assume that our disagreements define our personal opinions and should be considered for personalization. We use the DEAM dataset, the current benchmark dataset for MER, to pre-train our models. We then use the AMG1608 dataset, the largest MER dataset containing multiple annotations per musical excerpt, to re-train diverse machine learning models using active learning and evaluate personalization.

At a low level, these terms generally involve textural properties, for example whether the guitar tends to play chords or single notes. At a higher level, they indicate the function the guitar is playing relative to other instruments of the ensemble, for example whether the guitar is accompanying in background, or if it is intended to play a part in the foreground. Automatic labelling of instrumental function has various potential applications including the creation of consistent datasets dedicated to the training of generative models that focus on a particular function. In this paper, we propose a computational method to identify rhythm guitar sections in symbolic tablatures. We define rhythm guitar as sections that aim at making the listener perceive the chord progression that characterizes the harmony part of the song. A set of 31 high level features is proposed to predict if a bar in a tablature should be labeled as rhythm guitar or not. These features are used by an LSTM classifier which yields to a F1 score of 0.95 on a dataset of 102 guitar tablatures with manual function annotations.

A distinguishing feature of our similarity measure is its interpretability. In particular, we can translate the most interesting paths into natural language, so that the causes of the similarity judgements can be readily understood by humans. We compare the accuracy of our similarity measure with other competitive path-based similarity baselines in two experimental settings and with four datasets.

Recently, this task has been formulated as a supervised learning problem, specifically by means of Convolutional Neural Networks due to their high performance and generalization capability. However, the requirement of training data for each new type of document still represents an important drawback. This issue can be palliated through Domain Adaptation (DA), which is the field that aims to adapt the knowledge learned with an annotated collection of data to other domains for which labels are not available. In this work, we combine a DA strategy based on adversarial training with Selectional Auto-Encoders to define an unsupervised framework for document analysis. Our experiments show a remarkable improvement for the layers that depict particular features at each domain, whereas layers that depict common features (such as staff lines) are barely affected by the adaptation process.

Their mere availability as scanned images does not enable tasks such as indexing or editing unless they are transcribed into a structured digital format. Given the cost and time required for manual transcription, Optical Music Recognition (OMR) presents itself as a promising alternative. Quite often, OMR systems show acceptable but not perfect performance, which eventually leaves them out of the transcription process. On the assumption that OMR systems might always make some errors, it is essential that the user corrects the output. This paper contributes to a better understanding of how music transcription is improved by the assistance of OMR systems that include the end-user in the recognition process. For that, we have measured the transcription time of a printed early music work under two scenarios: a manual one and a state-of-the-art OMR-assisted one, with several alternatives each.

In this work, we introduce SimCLR to the music domain and contribute a large chain of audio data augmentations to form a simple framework for self-supervised, contrastive learning of musical representations: CLMR. This approach works on raw time-domain music data and requires no labels to learn useful representations. We evaluate CLMR in the downstream task of music classification on the MagnaTagATune and Million Song datasets and present an ablation study to test which of our music-related innovations over SimCLR are most effective. A linear classifier trained on the proposed representations achieves a higher average precision than supervised models on the MagnaTagATune dataset, and performs comparably on the Million Song dataset. Moreover, we show that CLMR's representations are transferable using out-of-domain datasets, indicating that our method has strong generalisability in music classification. Lastly, we show that the proposed method allows data-efficient learning on smaller labeled datasets: we achieve an average precision of 33.1% despite using only 259 labeled songs in the MagnaTagATune dataset (1% of the full dataset) during linear evaluation.

We consider the relation with principal component analysis, which only meets the first of these requirements. Theoretically, the principal components of a repertoire of random walks are known to be cosines.

In this paper, we aim to further extend this idea and examine the feasibility of automatic instrumentation—dynamically assigning instruments to notes in solo music during performance. In addition to the online, real-time-capable setting for performative use cases, automatic instrumentation can also find applications in assistive composing tools in an offline setting. Due to the lack of paired data of original solo music and their full arrangements, we approach automatic instrumentation by learning to separate parts (e.g., voices, instruments and tracks) from their mixture in symbolic multitrack music, assuming that the mixture is to be played on a keyboard. We frame the task of part separation as a sequential multi-class classification problem and adopt machine learning to map sequences of notes into sequences of part labels. To examine the effectiveness of our proposed models, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation over four diverse datasets of different genres and ensembles—Bach chorales, string quartets, game music and pop music.

Two separate music alignment methods based on image registration were developed for this purpose; a B-spline implementation that produces a continuous temporal transformation curve and a Demons algorithm that produces displacement matrices for time and pitch that also account for local timing variations across the pitch range. Both methods start from an Onsetgram of onset salience across pitch and time and perform the alignment task accurately. Various settings of the Demons algorithm were further evaluated in an ablation study. The final dataset is around 43 minutes long and consists of 19 734 notes of Hardanger fiddle music, recorded in stereo. The dataset and source code are available online. The dataset will be used in MIR research for tasks involving polyphonic transcription, score alignment, beat tracking, downbeat tracking, tempo estimation, and classification of emotional expressions.";"Anders Elowsson, RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time and Motion, University of Oslo, NOR, education;Olivier Lartillot, RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time and Motion, University of Oslo, NOR, education";University of Oslo, University of Oslo;education, education;NOR, NOR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-32.314068;58.33103

Musical rhythm comprises complex hierarchical relationships across time, rendering its analysis intrinsically challenging and at times subjective. Furthermore, systems which attempt to estimate rhythmic information in real-time must be causal and must produce estimates quickly and efficiently. In this work, we introduce an online system for joint beat, downbeat, and meter tracking, which utilizes causal convolutional and recurrent layers, followed by a pair of sequential Monte Carlo particle filters applied during inference. The proposed system does not need to be primed with a time signature in order to perform downbeat tracking, and is instead able to estimate meter and adjust the predictions over time. Additionally, we propose an information gate strategy to significantly decrease the computational cost of particle filtering during the inference step, making the system much faster than previous sampling-based methods. Experiments on the GTZAN dataset, which is unseen during training, show that the system outperforms various online beat and downbeat tracking systems and achieves comparable performance to a baseline offline joint method.;"Mojtaba Heydari, University of Rochester, USA, education;Frank Cwitkowitz, University of Rochester, USA, education;Zhiyao Duan, University of Rochester, USA, education";University of Rochester, University of Rochester, University of Rochester;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;58.810314;7.2057114
"Naotake Masuda;Daisuke Saito";Synthesizer Sound Matching with Differentiable DSP;2021;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5624609;While synthesizers have become commonplace in music production, many users find it difficult to control the parameters of a synthesizer to create the intended sound. In order to assist the user, the sound matching task aims to estimate synthesis parameters that produce a sound closest to the query sound. Recently, neural networks have been employed for this task. These neural networks are trained on paired data of synthesis parameters and the corresponding output sound, optimizing a loss of synthesis parameters. However, synthesis parameters are only indirectly correlated with the audio output. Another problem is that query made by the user usually consists of real-world sounds, different from the synthesizer output used during training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the problem of synthesizer sound matching by implementing a basic subtractive synthesizer using differentiable DSP modules. This synthesizer has interpretable controls and is similar to those used in music production. We can then train an estimator network by directly optimizing the spectral similarity of the synthesized output. Furthermore, we can train the network on real-world sounds whose ground-truth synthesis parameters are unavailable. We pre-train the network with parameter loss and fine-tune the model with spectral loss using real-world sounds. We show that the proposed method finds better matches compared to baseline models.;"Naotake Masuda, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education;Daisuke Saito, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education";University of Tokyo, University of Tokyo;education, education;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;16.711103;-35.89392
"Luke O Rowe;George Tzanetakis";Curriculum Learning for Imbalanced Classification in Large Vocabulary Automatic Chord Recognition;2021;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5624463;A problem inherent to the task of large vocabulary automatic chord recognition (ACR) is that the distribution over the chord qualities typically exhibits power-law characteristics. This intrinsic imbalance makes it difficult for ACR systems to learn the rare chord qualities in a large chord vocabulary. While recent ACR systems have exploited the hierarchical relationships that exist between chord qualities, few have attempted to exploit these relationships explicitly to improve the classification of rare chord qualities. In this paper, we propose a convolutional Transformer model for the task of ACR trained on a dataset of 1217 tracks over a large chord vocabulary consisting of 170 chord types. In order to address the class imbalance of the chord quality distribution, we incorporate the hierarchical relationships between chord qualities into a curriculum learning training scheme that gradually learns the rare and complex chord qualities in the dataset. We show that the proposed convolutional Transformer model achieves state-of-the-art performance on traditional ACR evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we show that the proposed curriculum learning training scheme outperforms existing methods in improving the classification of rare chord qualities.;"Luke Rowe, University of Victoria, CAN, education;George Tzanetakis, University of Victoria, CAN, education";University of Victoria, University of Victoria;education, education;CAN, CAN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;31.805004;-57.485764

In this paper, we investigate how popular music can support the listener's mental health through a case study of fans of the music group BTS, with a goal of understanding how they perceive and describe the way music is influencing their mental health. We aim to derive specific design implications for CMS to facilitate such support for fans' mental health and wellbeing. Through an online survey of 1190 responses, we identify and discuss the patterns of seven different mood regulations along with major themes on fans' lived experiences of how BTS's music (1) provides comfort, (2) catalyzes self-growth, and (3) facilitates coping.

However, its relationship to users and their satisfaction is not well understood, especially in the music domain. We present a user study: 92 participants were asked to evaluate personalized recommendation lists at varying levels of diversity. Recommendations were generated by two different collaborative filtering methods, and diversified in three different ways, one of which is a simple and novel method based on genre filtering. All diversified lists were recognised by users to be more diverse, and this diversification increased overall recommendation list satisfaction. Our simple filtering approach was also successful at tailoring diversity to some users. Within the collaborative filtering framework, however, we were not able to generate enough diversity to match all user preferences. Our results highlight the need to diversify in music recommendation lists, even when it comes at the cost of accuracy.;"Kyle Robinson, David R.

So far, little work has been done applying these architectures to music information retrieval tasks, with most models still relying on sequential neural network architectures. In this paper, we adapt the Inception architecture to the specific needs of harmonic music analysis and use it to create a model (InceptionKeyNet) for the task of key estimation. We then show that the resulting model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art single-task models when trained on the same datasets. Additionally, we evaluate a broad range of augmentation methods and find that extending augmentation policies to include a more diverse set of methods further improves accuracy.

Kazuhiko Yamamoto;Human-in-the-Loop Adaptation for Interactive Musical Beat Tracking;2021;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5624651;In music information retrieval (MIR), beat-tracking is one of the most fundamental and important task. However, a perfect algorithm is difficult to achieve. In addition, there could be a no unique correct answer because what one interprets as a beat differs for each individual. To address this, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop user interface that allows the system to interactively adapt to a specific user and target music. In our system, the user does not need to correct all errors manually, but rather only a small portion of the errors. The system then adapts the internal neural network model to the target, and automatically corrects remaining errors. This is achieved by a novel adaptive runtime self-attention in which the adaptable parameters are intimately integrated as a part of the user interface. It enables both low-cost training using only a local context of the music piece, and by contrast, highly effective runtime adaptation using the global context. We show our framework dramatically reduces the user's effort of correcting beat tracking errors in our experiments.;Kazuhiko Yamamoto, YAMAHA Corporation, JPN, company;Yamaha Corporation;company;JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;55.513966;3.517438

While such a framework is prevalent in the scenario of sequence labeling tasks and yields promising results in beat and downbeat estimations, it also indicates a shortage of the employed neural networks, given that the post-processing usually provides a notable performance gain over the previous stage. Moreover, the assumption often made for the post-processing is not suitable for many musical pieces. In this work, we attempt to improve the performance of joint beat and downbeat estimation without incorporating the post-processing stage.

Among the attempts to ameliorate the training process of GANs, the idea of Projected GAN emerges as an effective solution for GAN-based image generation, establishing the state-of-the-art in different image applications. The core idea is to use a pre-trained classifier to constrain the feature space of the discriminator to stabilize and improve GAN training. This paper investigates whether Projected GAN can similarly improve audio generation, by evaluating the performance of a StyleGAN2-based audio-domain loop generation model with and without using a pre-trained feature space in the discriminator. Moreover, we compare the performance of using a general versus domain-specific classifier as the pre-trained audio classifier. With experiments on both drum loop and synth loop generation, we show that a general audio classifier works better, and that with Projected GAN our loop generation models can converge around 5 times faster without performance degradation.;"Yen-Tung Yeh, Academia Sinica, TWN, education, National Taiwan University, TWN, education;Bo-Yu Chen, Academia Sinica, TWN, education, National Taiwan University, TWN, education;Yi-Hsuan Yang, Academia Sinica, TWN, education, Taiwan AI Labs, TWN, company";Academia Sinica, Academia Sinica, Academia Sinica;facility, facility, facility;TWN, TWN, TWN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;2.8673675;-28.509184

Specifically, using paired data of drumless tracks and the corresponding human-made drum tracks, we train a Transformer model to improvise the drum part of an unseen drumless recording. We combine two approaches to encode the input audio. First, we train a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to represent the input audio with discrete codes, which can then be readily used in a Transformer. Second, using an audiodomain beat tracking model, we compute beat-related features of the input audio and use them as embeddings in the Transformer. Instead of generating the drum track directly as waveforms, we use a separate VQ-VAE to encode the mel-spectrogram of a drum track into another set of discrete codes, and train the Transformer to predict the sequence of drum-related discrete codes. The output codes are then converted to a mel-spectrogram with a decoder, and then to the waveform with a vocoder. We report both objective and subjective evaluations of variants of the proposed model, demonstrating that the model with beat information generates drum accompaniment that is rhythmically and stylistically consistent with the input audio.;"Yueh-Kao Wu, Academia Sinica, TWN, facility;Ching-Yu Chiu, National Cheng Kung University, TWN, education;Yi-Hsuan Yang, Taiwan AI Labs, TWN, company";Academia Sinica, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan AI Labs;facility, education, company;TWN, TWN, TWN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;49.540115;-28.92966

Taking inspiration from Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP), we propose a new vocoder named SawSing for singing voices. SawSing synthesizes the harmonic part of singing voices by filtering a sawtooth source signal with a linear time-variant finite impulse response filter whose coefficients are estimated from the input mel-spectrogram by a neural network. As this approach enforces phase continuity, SawSing can generate singing voices without the phase-discontinuity glitch of many existing vocoders. Moreover, the source-filter assumption provides an inductive bias that allows SawSing to be trained on a small amount of data. Our evaluation shows that SawSing converges much faster and outperforms state-of-the-art generative adversarial networkand diffusion-based vocoders in a resource-limited scenario with only 3 training recordings and a 3-hour training time.;"Da-Yi Wu, Academia Sinica, TWN, education;Wen-Yi Hsiao, Taiwan AI Labs, TWN, company;Fu-Rong Yang, National Tsing Hua Univ., TWN, education;Oscar Friedman, 470 Music Group, USA, company;Warren Jackson, PARC, USA, facility;Scott Bruzenak, 470 Music Group, USA, company;Yi-Wen Liu, National Tsing Hua Univ., TWN, education;Yi-Hsuan Yang, Academia Sinica, TWN, education, Taiwan AI Labs, TWN, company";Academia Sinica, Taiwan AI Labs, National Tsing Hua University, 470 Music Group, PARC, 470 Music Group, National Tsing Hua University, Academia Sinica;facility, company, education, company, facility, company, education, facility;TWN, TWN, TWN, USA, USA, USA, TWN, TWN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;30.821915;-12.3744135

The work of twelve-tone composers is famously challenging to traditional Western tonal and structural sensibilities; even so, group theoretic approaches have determined that 10% of certain composers' works contain a highly unusual classical symmetry of music. We extend this result by revealing many symmetries that were previously undetected in the works of Schoenberg, Webern, and Berg. Our approach is computational rather than group theoretic, scanning each composition for symmetries of many different cardinalities. Thus, we capture partial symmetries that would be overlooked by more formal means. Moreover, our methods are applicable beyond the narrow scope of twelve-tone composition. We achieve our results by first extending the group-theoretic notion of symmetry to encompass shorter motives that may be repeated and reprised in a given composition, and then comparing the incidence of these symmetries between the work of composers and the space of all possible 12-tone rows. We present four candidate hierarchies of symmetry and show that in each model, between 75% and 95% of actual compositions contained high levels of internal symmetry.";"Anil Venkatesh, Adelphi University, USA, education;Viren Sachdev, Adelphi University, USA, education";Adelphi University, Adelphi University;education, education;USA, USA;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-7.258053;-1.4960914
"Bruno Di Giorgi;Mark Levy;Richard Sharp";Mel Spectrogram Inversion with Stable Pitch;2022;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7316638;Vocoders are models capable of transforming a low-dimensional spectral representation of an audio signal, typically the mel spectrogram, to a waveform. Modern speech generation pipelines use a vocoder as their final component. Recent vocoder models developed for speech achieve high degree of realism, such that it is natural to wonder how they would perform on music signals. Compared to speech, the heterogeneity and structure of the musical sound texture offers new challenges. In this work we focus on one specific artifact that some vocoder models designed for speech tend to exhibit when applied to music: the perceived instability of pitch when synthesizing sustained notes. We argue that the characteristic sound of this artifact is due to the lack of horizontal phase coherence, which is often the result of using a time-domain target space with a model that is invariant to time-shifts, such as a convolutional neural network. We propose a new vocoder model that is specifically designed for music. Key to improving the pitch stability is the choice of a shift-invariant target space that consists of the magnitude spectrum and the phase gradient. We discuss the reasons that inspired us to re-formulate the vocoder task, outline a working example, and evaluate it on musical signals.

"Nikita Srivatsan;Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick";Checklist Models for Improved Output Fluency in Piano Fingering Prediction;2022;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7316716;In this work we present a new approach for the task of predicting fingerings for piano music. While prior neural approaches have often treated this as a sequence tagging problem with independent predictions, we put forward a checklist system, trained via reinforcement learning, that maintains a representation of recent predictions in addition to a hidden state, allowing it to learn soft constraints on output structure. We also demonstrate that by modifying input representations --which in prior work using neural models have often taken the form of one-hot encodings over individual keys on the piano --to encode relative position on the keyboard to the prior note instead, we can achieve much better performance. Additionally, we reassess the use of raw per-note labeling precision as an evaluation metric, noting that it does not adequately measure the fluency, i.e. human playability, of a model's output. To this end, we compare methods across several statistics which track the frequency of adjacent finger predictions that while independently reasonable would be physically challenging to perform in sequence, and implement a reinforcement learning strategy to minimize these as part of our training loss. Finally through human expert evaluation, we demonstrate significant gains in performability directly attributable to improvements with respect to these metrics.;"Nikita Srivatsan, Carnegie Mellon University, USA, education;Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, UC San Diego, USA, education";Carnegie Mellon University, University of California San Diego;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;3.285465;-36.34039

After the early twentieth century, with the development of new Chinese music, the ancient Chinese theory of scales gradually developed into a new pentatonic modes theory under the influence of western music. In this paper, we briefly introduce our self-built CNPM (Chinese National Pentatonic Modes) Dataset, then design residual convolutional neural network models to identify which TongGong system the mode belongs, the pitch of tonic, the mode pattern and the mode type from audio signals, in combination with musical domain knowledge. We use both single-task and multi-task models with three strategies for identification, and compare them with a simple template-based baseline method. In experiments, we use seven accuracy metrics to evaluate the models. The results on identifying both the tonic pitch and the pattern of mode correctly achieve an average accuracy of 69.65%.

Given that most of the errors induced by OMR processes appear non-musical to humans, we propose that the time to correct errors may be reduced by marking all symbols on a score that are musically unlikely, allowing the human to focus their attention accordingly. Using a dataset of Romantic string quartets, we train a variant of the Transformer network architecture on the task of classifying each symbol of an optically-recognized musical piece in symbolic format as correct or erroneous, based on whether a manual correction of the piece would require an insertion, deletion, or replacement of a symbol at that location. Since we have a limited amount of data with real OMR errors, we employ extensive data augmentation to add errors into training data in a way that mimics how OMR would modify the score. Our best-performing models achieve 99% recall and 50% precision on this error-detection task.;"Timothy de Reuse, Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology, McGill University, CAN, facility;Ichiro Fujinaga, Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology, McGill University, CAN, facility";Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology,Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology;facility, facility;CAN, CAN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;34.382713;40.21742

Early studies of equal-loudness contour can trace back to the 1920s and the measured loudness with respect to intensity and frequency has been revised many times since then. However, most studies merely focus on synthesized sound, and the induced theories on natural tones with complex timbre has rarely been justified. To this end, we investigate both theory and applications of natural-tone loudness perception in this paper via modeling piano tone. The theory part contains: 1) an accurate measurement of piano-tone equal-loudness contour of pitches, and 2) a machine-learning model capable of inferring loudness purely based on spectral features trained on human subject measurements. As for the application, we apply our theory to piano control transfer, in which we adjust the MIDI velocities on two different player pianos (in different acoustic environments) to achieve the same perceptual effect. Experiments show that both of our theoretical loudness modeling and the corresponding performance control transfer algorithm significantly outperform their baselines.;"Yang Qu, City University of Hong Kong, HKG, education; Music X Lab, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education;Yutian Qin, New York University, USA, education; Music X Lab, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education;Lecheng Chao, Music X Lab, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education;Hangkai Qian, Music X Lab, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education;Ziyu Wang, Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, ARE, education; Music X Lab, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education;Gus Xia, Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, ARE, education; Music X Lab, NYU Shanghai, CHN, education";City University of Hong Kong, New York University Shanghai, New York University, New York University Shanghai, New York University Shanghai, New York University Shanghai, Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, New York University Shanghai, Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, New York University Shanghai;education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education;HKG, CHN, USA, CHN, CHN, CHN, ARE, CHN, ARE, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developed economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;-0.100923404;-36.18561

In this paper, we explore using an estimate of the live music event rate (LMER) as a rough indicator to measure the strength of a local music scene. We define LMER as the number of music shows per 100,000 people per year and then explore how this indicator is (or is not) correlated with 28 other socioeconomic indicators. To do this, we analyze a set of 308,051 music events from 2019 across 1,139 cities in the United States.

Controllability is essential for building creative tools from such models. Recent work in this area has focused on disentangled latent space representations, but this is only part of the solution. Efficient control of semantic attributes must handle non-linearities and holes that occur in latent spaces, whilst minimising unwanted changes to other attributes.

In computer vision, concept learning was therein proposed to adjust explanations to the right abstraction level (e.g. detect clinical concepts from radiographs). These methods have yet to be used for MIR.In this paper, we adapt concept learning to the realm of music, with its particularities. For instance, music concepts are typically non-independent and of mixed nature (e.g. genre, instruments, mood), unlike previous work that assumed disentangled concepts.We propose a method to learn numerous music concepts from audio and then automatically hierarchise them to expose their mutual relationships. We conduct experiments on datasets of playlists from a music streaming service, serving as a few annotated examples for diverse concepts.

However, despite these improvements, several challenges remain. Particularly, the adaptation of available models to underrepresented music traditions in MIR is usually synonymous with collecting and annotating large amounts of data, which is impractical and time-consuming. Transfer learning, data augmentation, and fine-tuning techniques have been used quite successfully in related tasks and are known to alleviate this bottleneck. Furthermore, when studying these music traditions, models are not required to generalize to multiple mainstream music genres but to perform well in more constrained, homogeneous conditions. In this work, we investigate simple yet effective strategies to adapt beat and downbeat tracking models to two different Latin American music traditions and analyze the feasibility of these adaptations in real-world applications concerning the data and computational requirements. Contrary to common belief, our findings show it is possible to achieve good performance by spending just a few minutes annotating a portion of the data and training a model in a standard CPU machine, with the precise amount of resources needed depending on the task and the complexity of the dataset.;Not found;Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Universidad de la República, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, New York University;education, education, education, education;BRA, URY, BRA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developed economies;1.3203835;-1.0732284

This problem is referred to as domain shift and is commonly approached using domain adaptation (DA) methods. As one relevant scenario, automatic piano transcription algorithms in music learning applications potentially suffer from domain shift since pianos are recorded in different acoustic conditions using various devices. Yet, most currently available datasets for piano transcription only cover ideal recording situations with high-quality microphones. Consequently, a transcription model trained on these datasets will face a mismatch between source and target data in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we employ a recently proposed dataset which includes annotated piano recordings covering typical real-life recording settings for a piano learning application on mobile devices. We first quantify the influence of the domain shift on the performance of a deep learning-based piano multi-pitch estimation (MPE) algorithm. Then, we employ and evaluate four unsupervised DA methods to reduce domain shift. Our results show that the studied MPE model is surprisingly robust to domain shift in microphone mismatch scenarios and the DA methods do not notably improve the transcription performance.;"Franca Bittner, Fraunhofer IDMT, DEU, facility;Marcel Gonzalez, Fraunhofer IDMT, DEU, facility;Maike Richter, Fraunhofer IDMT, DEU, facility;Hanna Lukashevich, Fraunhofer IDMT, DEU, facility;Jakob Abeûer, Fraunhofer IDMT, DEU, facility";Fraunhofer IDMT, Fraunhofer IDMT, Fraunhofer IDMT, Fraunhofer IDMT, Fraunhofer IDMT;facility, facility, facility, facility, facility;DEU, DEU, DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;42.929874;-3.6505606

Instrument playing techniques (IPT) play an important role in musical performance.

In this study, we propose an end-to-end Guzheng playing technique detection system using Fully Convolutional Networks that can be applied to variable-length audio. Because each Guzheng playing technique is applied to a note, a dedicated onset detector is trained to divide an audio into several notes and its predictions are fused with frame-wise IPT predictions. During fusion, we add the IPT predictions frame by frame inside each note and get the IPT with the highest probability within each note as the final output of that note. We create a new dataset named GZ_IsoTech from multiple sound banks and real-world recordings for Guzheng performance analysis.

Using these fingerprints, the method performs a comprehensive search to identify the query audio and precisely estimate its timestamp in the reference audio. Our framework involves training a CNN to maximize the similarity between pairs of embeddings extracted from clean audio and its corresponding distorted and time-shifted version. We employ a channel-wise spectral-temporal attention mechanism to capture salient time indices and spectral bands in the CNN features. The attention mechanism enables the CNN to better discriminate the audio by giving more weight to the salient spectral-temporal patches in the signal.

Recent neural synthesizers have exhibited a tradeoff between domain-specific models that offer detailed control of only specific instruments, or raw waveform models that can train on any music but with minimal control and slow generation. In this work, we focus on a middle ground of neural synthesizers that can generate audio from MIDI sequences with arbitrary combinations of instruments in realtime. This enables training on a wide range of transcription datasets with a single model, which in turn offers note-level control of composition and instrumentation across a wide range of instruments. We use a simple two-stage process: MIDI to spectrograms with an encoder-decoder Transformer, then spectrograms to audio with a generative adversarial network (GAN) spectrogram inverter. We compare training the decoder as an autoregressive model and as a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and find that the DDPM approach is superior both qualitatively and as measured by audio reconstruction and Fréchet distance metrics.

However, progress is currently limited by the difficulty of obtaining such note labels for natural audio recordings at scale. In this paper, we take advantage of the fact that for monophonic music, the transcription problem is much easier and largely solved via modern pitch-tracking methods. Specifically, we show that we are able to combine recordings of real monophonic music (and their transcriptions) into artificial and musically-incoherent mixtures, greatly increasing the scale of labeled training data. By pretraining on these mixtures, we can use a larger neural network model and significantly improve upon the state of the art in multi-instrument polyphonic transcription. We demonstrate this improvement across a variety of datasets and in a ``zero-shot'' setting where the model has not been trained on any data from the evaluation domain.;"Ian Simon, Google Research, Brain Team, education;Josh Gardner, Google Research, Brain Team, education;Curtis Hawthorne, Google Research, Brain Team, education;Ethan Manilow, Google Research, Brain Team, education;Jesse Engel, Google Research, Brain Team, education";Google Research, Google Research, Google Research, Google Research, Google Research;company, company, company, company, company;USA, USA, USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;12.771906;-28.594528

Through its compatibility with a wide range of music genres and text styles (including conventional music tags), the resulting audio-text representation subsumes existing ontologies while graduating to true zero-shot functionalities.

These works have focused on generating either raw audio waveforms or symbolic music. In this work, we explore the feasibility of generating sheet music images, which is often the primary form in which musical compositions are notated for other musicians. Using the PrIMuS dataset as a testbed, we explore five different sequence-based approaches for generating lines of sheet music: generating sequences of (a) pixel columns, (b) image patches, (c) visual word tokens, (d) semantic tokens, and (e) XML-based tags.

With recent advancements in Deep Learning and powerful models such as Transformers, there has been huge progress in automatic music generation. In an accompaniment generation context, creating a coherent drum pattern with apposite fills and improvisations at proper locations in a song is a challenging task even for an experienced drummer. Drum beats tend to follow a repetitive pattern through stanzas with fills/improvisation at section boundaries. In this work, we tackle the task of drum pattern generation conditioned on the accompanying music played by four melodic instruments – Piano, Guitar, Bass and Strings. We use the transformer sequence to sequence model to generate a basic drum pattern conditioned on the melodic accompaniment to find that improvisation is largely absent, attributed possibly to its relatively low representation in the training data. We propose a novelty function that represents the extent of improvisation in a specific bar relative to its neighbors. We train a model to detect improvisation positions from the melodic accompaniment tracks. Finally, we use a novel BERT inspired in-filling architecture, to learn the structure of both the drums and melody to in-fill elements of improvised music.;"Rishabh Dahale, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education;Vaibhav Talwadker, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education;Preeti Rao, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, IND, education;Prateek Verma, Stanford University, USA, education";IIT Bombay, IIT Bombay, IIT Bombay, Stanford University;education, education, education, education;IND, IND, IND, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developed economies;49.739216;-28.541876

Traditional synchronization approaches are often based on dynamic time warping using chroma features as an input representation. Previous work has shown how one can integrate onset cues into this pipeline for improving the alignment's temporal accuracy. Furthermore, recent work based on deep neural networks has led to significant improvements for learning onset, beat, and downbeat activation functions. However, for music with soft onsets and abrupt tempo changes, these functions may be unreliable, leading to unstable results. As the main contribution of this paper, we introduce a combined approach that integrates activation functions into the synchronization pipeline. We show that this approach improves the temporal accuracy thanks to the activation cues while inheriting the robustness of the traditional synchronization approach.

"Yigitcan Özer;Meinard Müller";Source Separation of Piano Concertos with Test-Time Adaptation;2022;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7316708;Music source separation (MSS) aims at decomposing a music recording into constituent sources, such as a lead instrument and the accompaniment. Despite the difficulties in MSS due to the high correlation of musical sources in time and frequency, deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to substantial improvements to accomplish this task. For training supervised machine learning models such as DNNs, isolated sources are required. In the case of popular music, one can exploit open-source datasets which involve multitrack recordings of vocals, bass, and drums. For western classical music, however, isolated sources are generally not available. In this article, we consider the case of piano concertos, which are composed for a pianist typically accompanied by an orchestra. The lack of multitrack recordings makes training supervised machine learning models for the separation of piano and orchestra challenging. To overcome this problem, we generate artificial training material by randomly mixing sections of the solo piano repertoire (e.g., piano sonatas) and orchestral pieces without piano (e.g., symphonies) to train state-of-the-art DNN models for MSS. As our main contribution, we propose a test-time adaptation (TTA) procedure, which exploits random mixtures of the piano-only and orchestra-only parts in the test data to further improve the separation quality.;"Yigitcan Özer, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility;Meinard Müller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility";International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen;facility, facility;DEU, DEU;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;40.58668;-24.571325

Automated Dense Soundtrack Construction for Books using Movie Adaptations;2022;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7372149;Reading, much like music listening, is an immersive experience that transports readers while taking them on an emotional journey. Listening to complementary music has the potential to amplify the reading experience, especially when the music is stylistically cohesive and emotionally relevant. In this paper, we propose the first fully automatic method to build a dense soundtrack for books, which can play high-quality instrumental music for the entirety of the reading duration. Our work employs a unique text processing and music weaving pipeline that determines the context and emotional composition of scenes in a chapter. This allows our method to identify and play relevant excerpts from the soundtrack of the book's movie adaptation. By relying on the movie composer's craftsmanship, our book soundtracks include expert-made motifs and other scene-specific musical characteristics. We validate the design decisions of our approach through a perceptual study. Our readers note that the book soundtrack greatly enhanced their reading experience, due to high immersiveness granted via uninterrupted and style-consistent music, and a heightened emotional state attained via high precision emotion and scene context recognition.;"Jaidev Shriram, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, IND, education;Makarand Tapaswi, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, IND, education;Vinoo Alluri, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, IND, education";International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad, International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad, International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad;education, education, education;IND, IND, IND;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;-24.80681;-25.91593

On the one hand, the introduction of the metric learning paradigm has favored the emergence of scalable yet accurate VI systems. On the other hand, using features focusing on specific aspects of musical pieces, such as melody, harmony, or lyrics, yielded interpretable and promising performances. In this work, we build upon these recent advances and propose a metric learning-based system systematically leveraging four dimensions commonly admitted to convey musical similarity between versions: melodic line, harmonic structure, rhythmic patterns, and lyrics. We describe our deliberately simple model architecture, and we show in particular that an approximated representation of the lyrics is an efficient proxy to discriminate between versions and non-versions. We then describe how these features complement each other and yield new state-of-the-art performances on two publicly available datasets.

However, state-of-the-art music generation systems require large amounts of data and computational resources for training, and are slow at inference. This makes them impractical for real-time interactive use. In this work, we introduce Musika, a music generation system that can be trained on hundreds of hours of music using a single consumer GPU, and that allows for much faster than real-time generation of music of arbitrary length on a consumer CPU. We achieve this by first learning a compact invertible representation of spectrogram magnitudes and phases with adversarial autoencoders, then training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on this representation for a particular music domain. A latent coordinate system enables generating arbitrarily long sequences of excerpts in parallel, while a global context vector allows the music to remain stylistically coherent through time. We perform quantitative evaluations to assess the quality of the generated samples and showcase options for user control in piano and techno music generation.

Detecting such structures is vital for numerous MIR tasks such as musicological analysis, key detection, music segmentation, and others. However, automatic cadence detection remains a challenging task mainly because it involves a combination of high-level musical elements like harmony, voice leading, and rhythm. In this work, we present a graph representation of symbolic scores as an intermediate means to solve the cadence detection task. We approach cadence detection as an imbalanced node classification problem using a Graph Convolutional Network. We obtain results that are at least on par with the state of the art, and we present a model capable of making predictions at multiple levels of granularity, from individual notes to beats, thanks to the fine-grained, note-by-note representation. Moreover, our experiments suggest that graph convolution is able to learn non-local features that assist in cadence detection, freeing us from the need of having to devise specialized features that encode non-local context. We argue that this general approach to modeling musical scores and classification tasks has a number of potential advantages, beyond the specific recognition task presented here.;"Emmanouil Karystinaios, Institute of Computational Perception, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria, education, LIT AI Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Austria, education;Gerhard Widmer, Institute of Computational Perception, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria, education, LIT AI Lab, Linz Institute of Technology, Austria, education";Johannes Kepler University,Johannes Kepler University;education, education;AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;22.225912;8.282567

Compared to automatic speech recognition (ASR), ALT is challenging due to the insufficiency of training data and the variation and contamination of acoustic features caused by singing expressions and accompaniment sounds. The domain adaptation approach has thus recently been taken for updating an ASR model pre-trained from sufficient speech data. In the naive application of the end-to-end approach to ALT, the internal audio-to-lyrics alignment often fails due to the time-stretching nature of singing features. To stabilize the alignment, we make use of the semi-synchronous relationships between notes and characters. Specifically, a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) is used for estimating the semitone-level pitches with note onset times while eliminating the intraand inter-note pitch variations. This estimate helps an end-to-end ALT model based on connectionist temporal classification (CTC) learn correct audio-to-character alignment and mapping, where the ALT model is trained jointly with the pitch and onset estimation model.

Previous approaches for this task have commonly used textual features extracted from the entirety of a song's lyrics, neglecting the inherent structure of lyrics consisting of, for instance, verses and choruses. Therefore, we pose the hypothesis that features extracted from different parts of the lyrics can have significantly different predictive power. To test this hypothesis, we perform a series of experiments to determine whether models trained on features taken from verses and choruses perform differently for genre recognition. Our experiments indeed confirm our hypothesis, showing that generally, using features extracted from verses leads to higher performance than features extracted from choruses. Digging deeper, we found that this is especially true for pop and rap songs.

In this paper, we develop MeloForm, a system that generates melody with musical form using expert systems and neural networks. Specifically, 1) we design an expert system to generate a melody by developing musical elements from motifs to phrases then to sections with repetitions and variations according to pre-given musical form; 2) considering the generated melody is lack of musical richness, we design a Transformer based refinement model to improve the melody without changing its musical form. MeloForm enjoys the advantages of precise musical form control by expert systems and musical richness learning via neural models. Both subjective and objective experimental evaluations demonstrate that MeloForm generates melodies with precise musical form control with 97.79% accuracy, and outperforms baseline systems in terms of subjective evaluation score by 0.75, 0.50, 0.86 and 0.89 in structure, thematic, richness and overall quality, without any labelled musical form data.

Our research quantitatively maps the extent of these cultural influences in popular music consumption, by using network analyses to explore cross-cultural popularity in music from 30 countries corresponding to 6 cultural regions (N = 4863 unique songs over six timepoints from 2019-2021). Using Top100 charts from these countries, we constructed a network based on the co-occurrence of songs in charts, and used eigencentrality as an indicator of cross-cultural song popularity. We then compared the country-of-origin of the artists, arousal music features, and socioeconomic indicators. Songs from artists with Anglo-American backgrounds tended to have higher eigencentrality overall, and mixed effects regressions showed that eigencentrality was negatively associated with danceability, and positively associated with spectral energy, and the migrant population of the country (of the charts). Next, using community detection, we observed 11 separate 'communities' in the network. Most communities appeared to be limited by region/culture, but Anglo-American music seemed disproportionally able to transcend cultural boundaries far beyond their geographical borders. We also discuss implications pertaining to cultural hegemony, and the effectiveness of our method in estimating cross-cultural popularity.;"Kongmeng Liew, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, JPN, education;Vipul Mishra, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, JPN, education;Yangyang Zhou, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, JPN, education;Elena V.

In the context of this research, we study the evolution of a subgenre of Byzantine music known as Heirmologic. We present three Heirmologic corpora spanning the periods before, during and after the 16th century. We discuss the challenges we faced during the digitisation process, and the steps we took to overcome them. For the analysis of the three corpora, we apply the three methods, namely notational texture, melodic arch similarity, and Jensen-Shannon distances of Markovian models, the second of which is novel and inspired by the idea of melodic arches. Through these methods, we aim at highlighting the differences of the corpora in order to obtain an outline of the evolution of the subgenre. We observe that the post 16th century Heirmologic pieces are more similar to the 16th century ones, while there is a greater difference with the pre 16th century pieces.

The content has been collected from a Greek documentary series that is available online, where academics present music traditions of Greece with live music and dance performance during the show, along with discussions about social, cultural and musicological aspects of the presented music. Therefore, this procedure has resulted in a significant wealth of descriptions regarding a variety of aspects, such as musical genre, places of origin and musical instruments. In addition, the audio recordings were performed under strict production-level specifications, in terms of recording equipment, leading to very clean and homogeneous audio content.

However, as its counterpart problem in the singing domain, the development of automatic lyric transcription (ALT) suffers from limited data and degraded intelligibility of sung lyrics. To fill in the performance gap between ALT and ASR, we attempt to exploit the similarities between speech and singing. In this work, we propose a transfer-learning-based ALT solution that takes advantage of these similarities by adapting wav2vec 2.0, an SSL ASR model, to the singing domain. We maximize the effectiveness of transfer learning by exploring the influence of different transfer starting points. We further enhance the performance by extending the original CTC model to a hybrid CTC/attention model. Our method surpasses previous approaches by a large margin on various ALT benchmark datasets.

To address this problem, we propose a CNN-Transformer-based MTI model designed to robustly identify a single melody track for a given MIDI file.

However, the sensitivity of these metrics to variations in the statistical parameters that define an audio texture is not well studied. In this work, we provide a systematic study of the sensitivity of some of the existing audio quality evaluation metrics to parameter variations in audio textures. Furthermore, we also study three more potentially parameter-sensitive metrics for audio texture synthesis, (a) a Gram matrix based distance, (b) an Accumulated Gram metric using a summarized version of the Gram matrices, and (c) a cochlear-model based statistical features metric. These metrics use deep features that summarize the statistics of any given audio texture, thus being inherently sensitive to variations in the statistical parameters that define an audio texture. We study and evaluate the sensitivity of existing standard metrics as well as Gram matrix and cochlear-model based metrics in response to control-parameter variations for audio textures across a wide range of texture and parameter types, and validate with subjective evaluation. We find that each of the metrics is sensitive to different sets of texture-parameter types.

Different from previous models that track beats solely based on the spectrogram of an audio mixture, our model deals with demixed spectrograms with multiple instrument channels. This is inspired by the fact that humans perceive metrical structures from richer musical contexts, such as chord progression and instrumentation. To this end, we develop a Transformer model with both time-wise attention and instrument-wise attention to capture deep-buried metrical cues. Moreover, our model adopts a novel dilated self-attention mechanism, which achieves powerful hierarchical modelling with only linear complexity. Experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in demixed beat tracking over the non-demixed version. Also, Beat Transformer achieves up to 4% point improvement in downbeat tracking accuracy over the TCN architectures.

"Jingwei Zhao;Gus Xia;Ye Wang";Domain Adversarial Training on Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder for Controllable Music Generation;2022;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7316816;The variational auto-encoder has become a leading framework for symbolic music generation, and a popular research direction is to study how to effectively control the generation process. A straightforward way is to control a model using different conditions during inference. However, in music practice, conditions are usually sequential (rather than simple categorical labels), involving rich information that overlaps with the learned representation. Consequently, the decoder gets confused about whether to listen to the latent representation or the condition, and sometimes just ignores the condition. To solve this problem, we leverage domain adversarial training to disentangle the representation from condition cues for better control. Specifically, we propose a condition corruption objective that uses the representation to denoise a corrupted condition. Minimized by a discriminator and maximized by the VAE encoder, this objective adversarially induces a condition-invariant representation. In this paper, we focus on the task of melody harmonization to illustrate our idea, while our methodology can be generalized to other controllable generative tasks.

Second, we develop a graphical user interface which allows users to select different styles of chord progression and piano texture. Currently, chord progression styles include Pop, R&amp;B, and Dark, while piano texture styles include several levels of voicing density and rhythmic complexity.

Recent work suggests that musical surprisal, that is, the unexpectedness of a musical event given its context, may directly predict listeners' experiences of pleasure and enjoyment during music listening. Understanding how surprisal shapes listeners' preferences for certain musical pieces has implications for music recommender systems, which are typically content(both acoustic or semantic) or metadata-based. Here we test a recently developed computational algorithm, called Dynamic-Regularity Extraction (D-REX), that uses Bayesian inference to predict the surprisal that humans experience while listening to music. We demonstrate that the brain tracks musical surprisal as modeled by D-REX by conducting a decoding analysis on the neural signal (collected through magnetoencephalography) of participants listening to music. Thus, we demonstrate the validity of a computational model of musical surprisal, which may remarkably inform the next generation of recommender systems.

This can be done in an efficient manner with models containing less than 100 million parameters that require no fine-tuning or reparameterization for downstream tasks, making this approach practical for industry-scale audio catalogs.Within the class of unsupervised learning strategies, we show that the domain of the training dataset can significantly impact the performance of representations learned by the model. We find that restricting the domain of the pre-training dataset to music allows for training with smaller batch sizes while achieving state-of-the-art in unsupervised learning---and in some cases, supervised learning---for music understanding.We also corroborate that, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on many tasks, supervised learning can cause models to specialize to the supervised information provided, somewhat compromising a model's generality.;"Matthew C.

Then, we expand the CRNN model to predict the quantised times for all beat and non-beat notes. Furthermore, we enable the model to predict the key signatures, time signatures, and hand parts of all notes. Our proposed performance MIDI-to-score system achieves significantly better performance compared to commercial software evaluated on the MV2H metric.

Harvesting data from a Facebook-hosted application, we align psychometric scores of 1,386 users to lyrics from the top 5 songs of their preferred music artists as emerged from Facebook Page Likes. We extract a set of lyrical features related to each song's overarching narrative, moral valence, sentiment, and emotion. A machine learning framework was designed to exploit regression approaches and evaluate the predictive power of lyrical features for inferring moral values. Results suggest that lyrics from top songs of artists people like inform their morality. Virtues of hierarchy and tradition achieve higher prediction scores (.20 ≤ r ≤ .30) than values of empathy and equality (.08 ≤ r ≤ .11), while basic demographic variables only account for a small part in the models' explainability. This shows the importance of music listening behaviours, as assessed via lyrical preferences, alone in capturing moral values. We discuss the technological and musicological implications and possible future improvements.;"Vjosa Preniqi, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Kyriaki Kalimeri, ISI Foundation, ITA, facility;Charalampos Saitis, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education";Queen Mary University of London, ISI Foundation, Queen Mary University of London;education, facility, education;GBR, ITA, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-3.2858307;49.872623

In this work, we explore cross-modal learning in an attempt to bridge audio and language in the music domain. To this end, we propose MusCALL, a framework for Music Contrastive Audio-Language Learning. Our approach consists of a dual-encoder architecture that learns the alignment between pairs of music audio and descriptive sentences, producing multimodal embeddings that can be used for text-to-audio and audio-to-text retrieval out-of-the-box. Thanks to this property, MusCALL can be transferred to virtually any task that can be cast as text-based retrieval. Our experiments show that our method performs significantly better than the baselines at retrieving audio that matches a textual description and, conversely, text that matches an audio query.

A dataset of 4000 symbolic scores and emotion labels was gathered by expanding the HTPD3 dataset with mood tags from last.fm and allmusic.com. We explore how bi-directional LSTM and Transformer encoder architectures can learn relationships between symbolic melodies, chord progressions, tempo, and expressed emotions, with and without a transfer learning strategy leveraging symbolic music data without emotion labels. Three emotion annotation summarisation methods based on the Arousal/Valence (AV) representation are compared: Emotion Average, Emotion Surface, and Emotion Category. 20 participants (average age: 30.2, 7 females and 13 males from Japan) rated how well generated accompaniments matched melodies (musical coherence) as well as perceived emotions for 75 arrangements corresponding to combinations of models and emotion summarisation methods. Musical coherence and match between target and perceived emotions were highest when melodies were encoded using a BLSTM model with transfer learning. The proposed method generates emotion-driven harmonic/tempo arrangements in a fast way, a keen advantage compared to state of the art.

"Franco Caspe;Andrew Mcpherson;Mark Sandler";DDX7: Differentiable FM Synthesis of Musical Instrument Sounds;2022;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7343063;FM Synthesis is a well-known algorithm used to generate complex timbre from a compact set of design primitives. Typically featuring a MIDI interface, it is usually impractical to control it from an audio source. On the other hand, Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) has enabled nuanced audio rendering by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that learn to control differentiable synthesis layers from arbitrary sound inputs. The training process involves a corpus of audio for supervision, and spectral reconstruction loss functions. Such functions, while being great to match spectral amplitudes, present a lack of pitch direction which can hinder the joint optimization of the parameters of FM synthesizers. In this paper, we take steps towards enabling continuous control of a well-established FM synthesis architecture from an audio input. Firstly, we discuss a set of design constraints that ease spectral optimization of a differentiable FM synthesizer via a standard reconstruction loss. Next, we present Differentiable DX7 (DDX7), a lightweight architecture for neural FM resynthesis of musical instrument sounds in terms of a compact set of parameters.

The advances in this field can be directly attributed to the availability of large-scale multitrack research datasets for these mentioned stems. Tasks such as separating similar-sounding sources from an ensemble recording have seen limited research due to the lack of sizeable, bleed-free multitrack datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel multitrack dataset called EnsembleSet generated using the Spitfire BBC Symphony Orchestra library using ensemble scores from RWC Classical Music Database and Mutopia. Our data generation method introduces automated articulation mapping for different playing styles based on the input MIDI/MusicXML data. The sample library also enables us to render the dataset with 20 different mix/microphone configurations allowing us to study various recording scenarios for each performance. The dataset presents 80 tracks (6+ hours) with a range of string, wind, and brass instruments arranged as chamber ensembles.

It is necessary to actively control musical expression for creating a new music performance that conveys various emotions or nuances. However, previous approaches were limited to following the composer's guidelines of musical expression or dealing with only a part of the musical attributes. We aim to disentangle the entire musical expression and structural attribute of piano performance using a conditional VAE framework. It stochastically generates expressive parameters from latent representations and given note structures. In addition, we employ self-supervised approaches that force the latent variables to represent target attributes. Finally, we leverage a two-step encoder and decoder that learn hierarchical dependency to enhance the naturalness of the output.

Yet, in music source separation, these characteristics have not been thoroughly considered, resulting in the domain mismatch between the laboratory and the real world. In this paper, we confirmed that this domain mismatch negatively affect the performance of the music source separation networks. To this end, we first created the out-of-domain evaluation datasets, musdb-L and XL, by mimicking the music mastering process. Then, we quantitatively verify that the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms significantly deteriorated in our datasets.

Stefan Lattner;SampleMatch: Drum Sample Retrieval by Musical Context;2022;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7316780;Modern digital music production typically involves combining numerous acoustic elements to compile a piece of music. Important types of such elements are drum samples, which determine the characteristics of the percussive components of the piece. Artists must use their aesthetic judgement to assess whether a given drum sample fits the current musical context. However, selecting drum samples from a potentially large library is tedious and may interrupt the creative flow. In this work, we explore the automatic drum sample retrieval based on aesthetic principles learned from data. As a result, artists can rank the samples in their library by fit to some musical context at different stages of the production process (i.e., by fit to incomplete song mixtures). To this end, we use contrastive learning to maximize the score of drum samples originating from the same song as the mixture. We conduct a listening test to determine whether the human ratings match the automatic scoring function. We also perform objective quantitative analyses to evaluate the efficacy of our approach.;Stefan Lattner, Sony Computer Science Laboratories (CSL), Paris, France, company;Sony Computer Science Laboratories;company;FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;53.98973;-26.14555

The automation of music production tasks has become an emerging field in recent years, where rule-based methods and machine learning approaches have been explored. Nevertheless, the lack of dry or clean instrument recordings limits the performance of such models, which is still far from professional human-made mixes. We explore whether we can use out-of-domain data such as wet or processed multitrack music recordings and repurpose it to train supervised deep learning models that can bridge the current gap in automatic mixing quality. To achieve this we propose a novel data preprocessing method that allows the models to perform automatic music mixing. We also redesigned a listening test method for evaluating music mixing systems.

A key challenge in *melody transcription* is building methods which can handle broad audio containing any number of instrument ensembles and musical styles---existing strategies work well for some melody instruments or styles but not all. To confront this challenge, we leverage representations from Jukebox (Dhariwal et al. 2020), a generative model of broad music audio, thereby improving performance on melody transcription by 20% relative to conventional spectrogram features. Another obstacle in melody transcription is a lack of training data---we derive a new dataset containing 50 hours of melody transcriptions from crowdsourced annotations of broad music. The combination of generative pre-training and a new dataset for this task results in 77% stronger performance on melody transcription relative to the strongest available baseline.

However, most of these results have been produced by unconditional models, which lack the ability to interact with their users, not allowing them to guide the generative process in meaningful and practical ways. Moreover, synthesizing music that remains coherent across longer timescales while still capturing the local aspects that make it sound ``realistic'' or human-like is still challenging. This is due to the large computational requirements needed to work with long sequences of data, and also to limitations imposed by the training schemes that are often employed. In this paper, we propose a generative model of symbolic music conditioned by data retrieved from human sentiment. The model is a Transformer-GAN trained with labels that correspond to different configurations of the valence and arousal dimensions that quantitatively represent human affective states. We try to tackle both of the problems above by employing an efficient linear version of Attention and using a Discriminator both as a tool to improve the overall quality of the generated music and its ability to follow the conditioning signals.;"Pedro L.

In this study, we investigate the stability of feature group importance when different classification methods and different measures of classification quality are applied. Since musical scores are particularly helpful in deriving semantically meaningful, robust genre characteristics, we focus on the feature groups analyzed by the jSymbolic feature extraction software, which describe properties associated with instrumentation, basic pitch statistics, melody, chords, tempo, and other rhythmic aspects. These symbolic features are analyzed in the context of musical information drawn from five other modalities, and experiments are conducted involving two datasets, one small and one large. The results show that, although some feature groups can remain similarly important compared to others, differences can also be evident in various applications, and can depend on the particular classifier and evaluation measure being used. Insights drawn from this type of analysis can potentially be helpful in effectively matching specific features or feature groups to particular classifiers and evaluation measures in future feature-based MIR research.;"Igor Vatolkin, TU Dortmund University, DEU, education;Cory McKay, Marianopolis College, CAN, education";Technische Universität Dortmund, Marianopolis College;education, education;DEU, CAN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;2.286162;24.710253

At the same time, we extend the analysis and also observe differences with regards to adoption rates between different channels as well as different factors that influences the adoption rate.

State-of-the-art systems are based on a variant of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and use some type of time-frequency audio representation as input, in a fitting combination to predict semantic tags available through expert or crowd-based annotation. In this work we systematically compare five widely used audio input representations (STFT, CQT, Mel spectrograms, MFCCs, and raw audio waveform) using five established convolutional neural network architectures (MusicCNN, VGG16, ResNet, a Squeeze and Excitation Network (SeNet), as well as a newly proposed MusicCNN variant using dilated convolutions) for the task of music tag prediction. Performance of all factor combinations are measured on two distinct tagging datasets, namely MagnaTagATune and MTG Jamendo. A two-way ANOVA shows that both input representation and model architecture significantly impact the classification results. Despite differently sized input representations and practical impact on model training, we find that using STFT as input representations provides the best results overall and on specific tag categories (genre, instrument, mood), while other representations show less consistent behavior in these regards.

Therefore, the primary motivation of this work is to explore the potential of Bayesian nonparametric models in comparison to DL models for music representation learning. More specifically, we assess the music representation learned from the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (HDPGMM), an infinite mixture model based on the Bayesian nonparametric approach, to MIR tasks, including classification, auto-tagging, and recommendation. The experimental result suggests that the HDPGMM music representation can outperform DL representations in certain scenarios, and overall comparable.;"Jaehun Kim, Delft University of Technology, NLD, education;Cynthia C.

Despite promising results achieved by such representations, dealing with the inherent hierarchical aspect of music structure remains a challenging problem. Because different levels of segmentation can be considered as equally valid, specifically designed representations should be optimized to improve hierarchical structure analysis. In this work, we explore unsupervised learning of such representations using a contrastive approach operating at different time-scales. We evaluate the proposed system on flat and multi-level music segmentation. By leveraging both time and the hierarchical organization of music structure, we show that the obtained deep embeddings can encode meaningful patterns and improve segmentation at various levels of granularity.;"Morgan Buisson, LTCI, Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France, education;Brian McFee, Music and Audio Research Laboratory, New York University, USA, education, Center of Data Science, New York University, USA, education;Slim Essid, LTCI, Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France, education;Hélène C.

Hence, there has been a growing interest in considering the user's situation when recommending music to users. Previous works have proposed personalized auto-taggers to infer situation-related tags from music content and user's global listening preferences. However, in a practical music retrieval system, these context-aware auto-tagger could be only used by assuming that the context class is explicitly provided by the user. In this work, for designing a fully automatised music retrieval system, we propose to disambiguate the user's listening information from stream data. Namely, we propose a system which can generate a situational playlist for a user at a certain time first by leveraging personalized music auto-taggers, and second by automatically inferring the user's situation from stream data (e.g. device, network) and user's general profile information (e.g. age). Experiments show that such a personalized context-aware music retrieval system is feasible, but the performance suffers in the case of new users, new tracks or when the number of context classes increases.;"Karim M.

Elio Quinton;Equivariant self-supervision for musical tempo estimation;2022;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7316602;Self-supervised methods have emerged as a promising avenue for representation learning in the recent years since they alleviate the need for labeled datasets, which are scarce and expensive to acquire. Contrastive methods are a popular choice for self-supervision in the audio domain, and typically provide a learning signal by forcing the model to be invariant to some transformations of the input. These methods, however, require measures such as negative sampling or some form of regularisation to be taken to prevent the model from collapsing on trivial solutions. In this work, instead of invariance, we propose to use equivariance as a self-supervision signal to learn audio tempo representations from unlabelled data. We derive a simple loss function that prevents the network from collapsing on a trivial solution during training, without requiring any form of regularisation or negative sampling.Our experiments show that it is possible to learn meaningful representations for tempo estimation by solely relying on equivariant self-supervision, achieving performance comparable with supervised methods on several benchmarks.

Recognition of emotions highlights music's social and psychological functions, extending traditional applications such as style recognition or content similarity. Once musical data are intrinsically multi-modal, exploring this characteristic is usually beneficial. However, building a structure that incorporates different modalities in a unique space to represent the songs is challenging. Integrating information from related instances by learning heterogeneous graph-based representations has achieved state-of-the-art results in multiple tasks. This paper proposes structuring musical features over a heterogeneous network and learning a multi-modal representation using Graph Convolutional Networks with features extracted from audio and lyrics as inputs to handle the music emotion recognition tasks.

The absence of a unified vision makes it difficult to pinpoint its state-of-the-art and determine directions for improvement. To get past this bottleneck, it is necessary to consolidate datasets and evaluation methodologies to allow comprehensive benchmarking. In our review of prior work, we demonstrate the extent of variation in problem scope, datasets, and evaluation practices across audio to score alignment research. To circumvent the high cost of creating large-scale datasets with various instruments, styles, performance conditions, and musician proficiency from scratch, the research community could generate ground truth approximations from non-audio to score alignment datasets which include a temporal mapping between a music score and its corresponding audio. We show a methodology for adapting the Aligned Scores and Performances dataset, created originally for beat tracking and music transcription. We filter the dataset semiautomatically by applying a set of Dynamic Time Warping based Audio to Score Alignment methods using out-of-the-box Chroma and Constant-Q Transform extraction algorithms, suitable for the characteristics of the piano performances of the dataset. We use the results to discuss the limitations of the generated ground truths and data adaptation method.

In this paper, we address this problem by introducing Violin Etudes, a 27.8-hours violin performance dataset constructed with domain knowledge in instrument pedagogy and a novel automatic f0-labeling paradigm. Experimental results on unseen datasets show that the CREPE f0 estimator trained on Violin Etudes outperforms the widely-used pre-trained version trained on multiple manually-labeled datasets. Further preliminary findings suggest that (i) existing data-driven f0 estimators may overfit to equal temperament, and (ii) iterative re-labeling regularized by our novel Constrained Harmonic Resynthesis method can simultaneously enhance datasets and f0 estimators.

First, we exploit the public editorial metadata available on Discogs, an extensive community-maintained music database containing information about artists, releases, and record labels. Second, we use a contrastive learning setup based on COLA, different from previous systems based on triplet loss. We train models targeting several associations derived from the metadata and experiment with stacked combinations of learned representations, evaluating them on standard music classification tasks. Additionally, we consider learning all the associations jointly in a multi-task setup. We show that it is possible to improve the performance of current self-supervised models by using inexpensive metadata commonly available in music collections, producing representations comparable to those learned on classification setups. We find that the resulting representations based on editorial metadata outperform a system trained with music style tags available in the same large-scale dataset, which motivates further research using this type of supervision.

In music information retrieval (MIR), one promising recent application of self-supervised learning is the CLMR framework (contrastive learning of musical representations). CLMR has shown good performance, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art end-to-end classification models, but it is strictly an encoding framework. It suffers the characteristic limitation of any encoder that it cannot explicitly combine multi-timescale information, whereas a characteristic feature of human audio perception is that we tend to perceive all frequencies simultaneously. To this end, we propose a generalization of CLMR that learns to extract and explicitly combine representations across different frequency resolutions, which we coin the tailed U-Net (TUNe). TUNe architectures combine multi-timescale information during a decoding phase, similar to U-Net architectures used in computer vision and source separation, but have a tail added to reduce sample-level information to a smaller pre-defined number of representation dimensions. The size of the decoding phase is a hyperparameter, and in the case of a zero-layer decoding phase, TUNe reduces to CLMR. The best TUNe architectures, however, require less training time to match CLMR performance, have superior transfer learning performance, and are competitive with state-of-the-art models even at dramatically reduced dimensionalities.;"Marcel A.

Ke Nie;Inaccurate Prediction or Genre Evolution? Rethinking Genre Classification;2022;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7342846;The existing MIR research on genre classification primarily focuses on how to classify a song into the correct genre while downplaying the fact that genres mutate over time and in response to social change in terms of their musical properties. Songs claiming the same genre can sound very different if they are released years apart, and genres may revive musical traditions from the past. In this paper, I show that the performance of genre classifiers fluctuates as genres evolve. Unsatisfactory performance of the classifiers may not indicate algorithmic flaws but rather the change of genre characteristics. I demonstrate this by studying the case of Chinese Hip-Hop music. Specifically, I collected and analyzed 69,427 songs from four genres (Hip-Hop, Pop, Rock, and Folk) released on a Chinese music platform between 2009 and 2019. Using classifiers trained from the songs in different year cohorts to predict the genre of all the songs, I show how genre classifiers can be used to detect the stylistic shift in Hip-Hop that happened during this period. The paper thus offers a novel, sociological perspective on contending with the much-challenged idea of improving genre classification accuracy for its own sake. However, instead of questioning the effort, I argue that MIR research on genre classification can be helpful for studying genre as a social construct and cultural phenomenon if the pursuit of prediction performance and the cultural meaning of inaccurate prediction are carefully balanced.;Ke Nie, University of California, San Diego, USA, education;University of California San Diego;education;USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-1.3417193;34.721

Its main challenge is the lack of strong rhythmic and harmonic patterns that are important for music rhythmic analysis in general. Even for human listeners, this can be a challenging task. As a result, existing music beat tracking systems fail to deliver satisfactory performance on singing voices. In this paper, we propose singing beat tracking as a novel task, and propose the first approach to solving this task. Our approach leverages semantic information of singing voices by employing pre-trained self-supervised WavLM and DistilHuBERT speech representations as the front-end and uses a self-attention encoder layer to predict beats. To train and test the system, we obtain separated singing voices and their beat annotations using source separation and beat tracking on complete songs, followed by manual corrections. Experiments on the 741 separated vocal tracks of the GTZAN dataset show that the proposed system outperforms several state-of-the-art music beat tracking methods by a large margin in terms of beat tracking accuracy.

Recently, an increasing number of studies have focused on phrases that are smaller musical units, and several studies have addressed phrase-level control. In this study, we propose a method for sequentially generating a piece that enables the control of each phrase length and, consequently, the length of the entire piece. We added PHRASE and a new event, BAR COUNTDOWN, which indicates the number of bars remaining in the phrase, to the existing event-based music representations. To reflect user input indicating the phrase lengths of the piece being generated, we used an autoregressive generation model that adds these two events to the generated event-token sequence based on the user input and uses it as input for the next time step. Subjective listening tests revealed that the pieces generated by our methods possessed designated phrase lengths and ended naturally at the determined length.";"Daiki Naruse, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education, RIKEN, JPN, facility;Tomoyuki Takahata, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education, RIKEN, JPN, facility;Yusuke Mukuta, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education, RIKEN, JPN, facility;Tatsuya Harada, The University of Tokyo, JPN, education, RIKEN, JPN, facility";University of Tokyo, University of Tokyo, University of Tokyo, University of Tokyo;education, education, education, education;JPN, JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-4.352035;-27.016176

We investigate how singers use singing techniques using real-world recordings of famous solo singers in Japanese popular music songs (J-POP). First, we built a new dataset of singing techniques. The dataset consists of 168 commercial J-POP songs, and each song is annotated using various singing techniques with timestamps and vocal pitch contours. We also present descriptive statistics of singing techniques on the dataset to clarify what and how often singing techniques appear. We further explored the difficulty of the automatic detection of singing techniques using previously proposed machine learning techniques. In the detection, we also investigate the effectiveness of auxiliary information (i.e., pitch and distribution of label duration), not only providing the baseline. The best result achieves 40.4% at macro-average F-measure on nine-way multi-class detection.

One reason, of course, is the paucity of labeled datasets — which, if available, could be used to train machine learning approaches. Dataset curation cannot be crowdsourced; one needs trained musicians to devote sizable effort to carry out such annotations. Further, such an analysis is not simple for beginners; obtaining labeled data that can capture the nuances of a musician's reasoning acquired over years of practice is fraught with challenges. To this end, we provide a system for computational analysis of classical music, both for machine learning and music researchers. First, we introduce a labeled dataset containing 200 classical music pieces annotated by form and phrases. Then, by leveraging this dataset, we show that deep learning-based methods can be used to learn Form Classification as well as Phrase Analysis and Classification, for which few (if any) results have been reported yet. Taken together, we provide the community with a unique dataset as well as a toolkit needed to analyze classical music structure, which can be used or extended to drive applications in both commercial and educational settings.";"Daniel Szelogowski, University of Wisconsin Ð Whitewater, USA, education;Lopamudra Mukherjee, University of Wisconsin Ð Whitewater, USA, education;Benjamin Whitcomb, University of Wisconsin Ð Whitewater, USA, education";University of Wisconsin, University of Wisconsin, University of Wisconsin;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;11.979987;-11.599151

This paper reviews a data challenge on distinguishing computer-generated melodies from human-composed melodies held in association with the Conference on Sound and Music Technology (CSMT) in 2020. An investigation of the submitted systems and the results are presented first. Besides the structure of the proposed models, the paper investigates two important factors that were identified as contributors to good model performance: the specific music features and the music representation used. Through an analysis of the submissions, important melody-related music features have been identified. Encoding or representation of the music in the context of neural network modes has also been found to significantly impact system performance through an experiment where the top-ranked system was re-implemented with different input representations for comparison purposes. Besides demonstrating the feasibility of developing an objective music composition evaluation system, the investigation presented in this paper also reveals some important limitations of current music composition systems opening opportunities for future work in the community.;"Yuqiang Li, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, CHN, education;Shengchen Li, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, CHN, education;George Fazekas, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education";Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Queen Mary University of London;education, education, education;CHN, CHN, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developed economies;-25.680927;21.334017

These alterations could involve timbre translation, re-harmonization, or music rearrangement. Previous studies have achieved promising results utilizing time-frequency and symbolic music representations. Music style translation on raw audio has also been investigated and applied to single-instrument pieces. Although processing raw audio is more challenging, it provides richer information about timbres, dynamics, and articulations.In this paper, we introduce Music-STAR, the first audio-based translation system that translates the existing instruments in a piece into a set of target instruments without using source separation. To conduct our experiments, we also present an audio dataset that contains two-track pieces performed by two instrument sets alongside their stems.

However, the evaluation metrics for MIR tend to capture the model accuracy in terms of the goal. For instance, mode (melodic framework) recognition is implemented with a goal to evaluate and compare melodic analysis approaches, but it is worth investigating if at all it lends itself as one befitting proxy task. In this work, we aim to review whether the model actually learns the task it is intended for. This is particularly relevant in non-Eurogenetic music repertoires where the grammatical rules are rather prescriptive. We employ methodologies that combine domain-knowledge and data-driven optimizations as a possible way for a comprehensive understanding of these relationships. This is tested on Makam which is one of the understudied corpora in MIR. We evaluate an array of feature-engineering methods on the largest mode recognition dataset curated for Ottoman-Turkish makam music, composed of 1000 recordings in 50 makams. We adapted the time-delayed melody surfaces (TDMS) feature, which in combination with support vector machine (SVM) classifier yields 77.2% recognition accuracy, comparable to the current state-of-the-art. We also address (ethno)musicology-driven tasks with a view to gathering deeper insights into this music, such as tuning, intonation, and melodic similarity.

ALT has not been well developed mainly due to the dearth of the paired singing voice and lyrics datasets for model training. Considering that there is a large amount of ASR training data, a straightforward method is to leverage ASR data to enhance ALT training. However, the improvement is marginal when training the ALT system directly with ASR data, because of the gap between the singing voice and standard speech data which is rooted in music-specific acoustic characteristics in singing voice. In this paper, we propose PDAugment, a data augmentation method that adjusts pitch and duration of speech at syllable level under the guidance of music scores to help ALT training. Specifically, we adjust the pitch and duration of each syllable in natural speech to those of the corresponding note extracted from music scores, to narrow the gap between natural speech and singing voice. Experiments on DSing30 and Dali corpus show that the ALT system equipped with our PDAugment outperforms previous state-of-the-art systems by 5.9% and 18.1% WERs respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of PDAugment for ALT.;"Chen Zhang, Zhejiang University, CHN, education;Jiaxing Yu, Zhejiang University, CHN, education;LuChin Chang, Zhejiang University, CHN, education;Xu Tan, Microsoft Research Asia, company;Jiawei Chen, South China University of Technology, CHN, education;Tao Qin, Microsoft Research Asia, company;Kejun Zhang, Zhejiang University, CHN, education";Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University,Microsoft Research Asia, South China University of Technology,Microsoft Research Asia, Zhejiang University;education, education, education, company, education, company, education;CHN, CHN, CHN, CHN, CHN, CHN, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;19.618395;-22.978699

To pre-train CLaMP, we collected a large dataset of 1.4 million music-text pairs.

In addition, we developed a masked music model pre-training objective to enhance the music encoder's comprehension of musical context and structure. CLaMP integrates textual information to enable semantic search and zero-shot classification for symbolic music, surpassing the capabilities of previous models. To support the evaluation of semantic search and music classification, we publicly release WikiMusicText (WikiMT), a dataset of 1010 lead sheets in ABC notation, each accompanied by a title, artist, genre, and description.

To faithfully encode such relations, we need an elegant way to represent both the semantics of prolongation, where a single event is elaborated into multiple events, and process, where the connection from one event to another is elaborated into multiple connections. In existing works, trees are used to capture the former and graphs for the latter. Each such model has the potential to either encode relations between events (e.g., an event being a repetition of another), or relations between processes (e.g., two consecutive steps making up a larger skip), but not both together explicitly. To model meaningful relations between musical events and processes and combine the semantic expressiveness of trees and graphs, we propose a structured representation using algebraic datatype (ADT) with dependent type. We demonstrate its applications towards encoding functional interpretations of harmonic progressions, and large scale organizations of key regions. This paper offers two contributions. First, we provide a novel unifying hierarchical framework for musical processes and events. Second, we provide a structured data type encoding such interpretations, which could facilitate computational approaches in music theory and generation.;"Zeng Ren, EPFL, CHE, education;Wulfram Gerstner, EPFL, CHE, education;Martin Rohrmeier, EPFL, CHE, education";École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;education, education, education;CHE, CHE, CHE;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-1.0551094;3.282343

In an effort towards a unified model of form, this paper proposes an integration of repetition structure (i.e., which segments of a piece occur several times) and formal templates (such as AABA). While repetition structure can be modeled using context-free grammars, most prior approaches allow for arbitrary grammar rules. Constraining the structure of the inferred rules to conform to a small set of templates (meta-rules) not only reduces the space of possible rules that need to be considered but also ensures that the resulting repetition grammar remains interpretable in the context of musical form.

Equally aimed at music-analytical corpus studies, MIR, and machine-learning research, DiMCAT performs common data transformations and analyses using dataframes. Dataframes reduce the inherent complexity of atomic score contents (e.g., notes), larger score entities (e.g., measures), and abstractions (e.g., chord symbols) into easily manipulable computational structures, whose vectorized operations scale to large quantities of musical material. The design of DiMCAT's API prioritizes computational speed and ease of use, thus aiming to cater to machine-learning practitioners and musicologists alike.;"Johannes Hentschel, Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland, education;Andrew McLeod, Fraunhofer IDMT, Ilmenau, Germany, facility;Yannis Rammos, Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland, education;Martin Rohrmeier, Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland, education";École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Fraunhofer IDMT, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;education, facility, education, education;CHE, DEU, CHE, CHE;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-28.59108;2.91083

The corpus can be considered a meta corpus in that it both extends and combines two existing corpora—the widely-used McGill Billboard corpus the and RS200 corpus. Both the McGill Billboard corpus and the RS200 contain expert harmonic annotations using different encoding schemes and each represent harmony in fundamentally different ways: Billboard using a root-quality representation and the RS200 using Roman numerals. By combining these corpora into a unified format, using the well-known **kern and**harm representations, we aim to facilitate research in computational musicology, which is frequently burdened by corpora spread across multiple encoding formats. The format will also facilitate cross-corpus comparison with the large body of existing works in **kern format. For a 100-song subset of the CoCoPops-Billboard collection, we also provide participant ratings of continuous valence and arousal ratings, along with the RMS (Root Mean Square) signal level and associated timestamps.

"Yiwei Ding;Alexander Lerch";Audio Embeddings as Teachers for Music Classification;2023;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10265353;Music classification has been one of the most popular tasks in the field of music information retrieval. With the development of deep learning models, the last decade has seen impressive improvements in a wide range of classification tasks. However, the increasing model complexity makes both training and inference computationally expensive. In this paper, we integrate the ideas of transfer learning and feature-based knowledge distillation and systematically investigate using pre-trained audio embeddings as teachers to guide the training of low-complexity student networks. By regularizing the feature space of the student networks with the pre-trained embeddings, the knowledge in the teacher embeddings can be transferred to the students. We use various pre-trained audio embeddings and test the effectiveness of the method on the tasks of musical instrument classification and music auto-tagging. Results show that our method significantly improves the results in comparison to the identical model trained without the teacher's knowledge. This technique can also be combined with classical knowledge distillation approaches to further improve the model's performance.;"Yiwei Ding, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, education;Alexander Lerch, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, education";Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-8.678434;19.075436

The corpus is annotated with formal sections, aspects of vocal production (including reverberation, layering, panning, and gender of the performers), and relevant metadata. CoSoD complements other popular music datasets by focusing exclusively on musical collaborations between independent acts. In addition to facilitating the study of song form and vocal production, CoSoD allows for the in-depth study of gender as it relates to various timbral, pitch, and formal parameters in musical collaborations. In this paper, we detail the contents of the dataset and outline the annotation process. We also present an experiment using CoSoD that examines how the use of reverberation, layering, and panning are related to the gender of the artist.

Despite recent successful commercial solutions, implementing QbH systems remains challenging due to the lack of high-quality datasets for training machine learning models. In this paper, we propose a deep learning data collection technique and introduce Covers and Hummings Aligned Dataset (CHAD), a novel dataset that contains 18 hours of short music fragments, paired with time-aligned hummed versions. To expand our dataset, we employ a semi-supervised model training pipeline that leverages the QbH task as a specialized case of cover song identification (CSI) task. Starting with a model trained on the initial dataset, we iteratively collect groups of fragments of cover versions of the same song and retrain the model on the extended data. Using this pipeline, we collect over 308 hours of additional music fragments, paired with time-aligned cover versions. The final model is successfully applied to the QbH task and achieves competitive results on benchmark datasets.

Existing approaches employ convolutional blocks specifically designed to capture the harmonic structure. These approaches, however, require either large kernels or multiple kernels, with each kernel aiming to capture a different harmonic. We present TriAD, a convolutional block that achieves an unequally distanced dilation over the frequency axis. This allows our method to capture multiple harmonics with a single yet small kernel. We compare TriAD with other methods of capturing harmonics, and we observe that our approach maintains SOTA results while reducing the number of parameters required.

While taniavartanam segments have been segmented from concerts earlier, no effort has been made to analyze these percussion segments. This paper attempts to further segment the taniavartanam portion into musically meaningful segments. A taniavartanam segment consists of an abhipraya, where artists show their prowess at extempore enunciation of percussion stroke segments, followed by an optional korapu, where each artist challenges the other, and concluding with mohra and korvai, each with its own nuances. This work helps obtain a comprehensive musical description of the taniavartanam in Carnatic concerts. However, analysis is complicated owing to a plethora of tala and nade. The segmentation of a taniavartanam section can be used for further analysis, such as stroke sequence recognition, and help find relations between different learning schools.

Most state-of-the-art approaches for MPE are based on deep networks trained using pitch annotations as targets. The success of current methods is therefore limited by the difficulty of obtaining large amounts of accurate annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for learning MPE without any pitch annotations at all. Our approach exploits multiple recorded versions of a musical piece as surrogate targets. Given one version of a piece as input, we train a network to minimize the distance between its output and time-frequency representations of other versions of that piece. Since all versions are based on the same musical score, we hypothesize that the learned output corresponds to pitch estimates. To further ensure that this hypothesis holds, we incorporate domain knowledge about overtones and noise levels into the network. Overall, our method replaces strong pitch annotations with weaker and easier-to-obtain cross-version targets. In our experiments, we show that our proposed approach yields viable multi-pitch estimates and outperforms two baselines.;"Michael Krause, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility;Sebastian Strahl, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility;Meinard Müller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility";International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen;facility, facility, facility;DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;43.471443;-2.897393

Typically, SDTW is used to iteratively compute and refine soft alignments that compensate for temporal deviations between the training data and its weakly annotated targets. One major problem is that a mismatch between the estimated soft alignments and the reference alignments in the early training stage leads to incorrect parameter updates, making the overall training procedure unstable. In this paper, we investigate such stability issues by considering the task of pitch class estimation from music recordings as an illustrative case study. In particular, we introduce and discuss three conceptually different strategies (a hyperparameter scheduling, a diagonal prior, and a sequence unfolding strategy) with the objective of stabilizing intermediate soft alignment results. Finally, we report on experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategies and discuss efficiency and implementation issues.;"Johannes Zeitler, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility;Simon Deniffel, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility;Michael Krause, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility;Meinard Müller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Germany, facility";International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen;facility, facility, facility, facility;DEU, DEU, DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;44.212433;-3.0137334

In this study, we investigate the impact of different sampling techniques on musical qualities such as diversity and structure. To accomplish this, we train a high-capacity transformer model on a vast collection of highly-structured Irish folk melodies and analyze the musical qualities of the samples generated using distribution truncation sampling techniques. Specifically, we use nucleus sampling, the recently proposed typical sampling, and conventional ancestral sampling. We evaluate the effect of these sampling strategies in two scenarios: optimal circumstances with a well-calibrated model and suboptimal circumstances where we systematically degrade the model's performance.

A typical and recent approach to this is to learn, via deep neural networks, a joint embedding space that correlates short fixed-size snippets of audio and sheet music by means of an appropriate similarity structure. However, two challenges that arise out of this strategy are the requirement of strongly aligned data to train the networks, and the inherent discrepancies of musical content between audio and sheet music snippets caused by local and global tempo deviations. In this paper, we address these two shortcomings by designing a cross-modal recurrent network that learns joint embeddings that can summarize longer passages of corresponding audio and sheet music. The benefits of our method are that it only requires weakly aligned audio sheet music pairs, as well as that the recurrent network handles the non-linearities caused by tempo variations between audio and sheet music.

To substantiate the efficacy of our framework, we collected a singable lyrics dataset, which precisely aligns English, Japanese, and Korean lyrics on a line-by-line and section-by-section basis, and conducted a comparative analysis between singable and non-singable lyrics. Our multidisciplinary approach provides insights into the key components that underlie the art of lyric translation and establishes a solid groundwork for the future of computational lyric translation assessment.;"Haven Kim, Graduate School of Culture Technology, KAIST, South Korea, education;Kento Watanabe, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility;Juhan Nam, Graduate School of Culture Technology, KAIST, South Korea, education";Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology;education, facility, facility, education;KOR, JPN, JPN, KOR;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developing economies;24.437141;17.27176

Sturm;Arthur Flexer";A Review of Validity and Its Relationship to Music Information Research;2023;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10265219;Validity is the truth of an inference made from evidence and is a central concern in scientific work. Given the maturity of the domain of music information research (MIR), validity in our opinion should be discussed and considered much more than it has been so far. Puzzling MIR phenomena like adversarial attacks, horses, and performance glass ceilings become less mysterious through the lens of validity. In this paper, we review the subject of validity as presented in a key reference of causal inference: Shadish et al., Experimental and Quasi-experimental Designs for Generalised Causal Inference [1]. We discuss the four types of validity and threats to each one. We consider them in relationship to MIR experiments grounded with a practical demonstration using a typical MIR experiment.;"Bob L. T.

While timbre is the least specific parameter among these and is often only implicitly understood, prominent brass pedagogues have reported that the presence of excessive muscle tension and inefficiency in playing by a musician is reflected in the timbre quality of the sound produced. In this work, we explore the application of machine learning to automatically assess timbre quality in trumpet playing, given both its educational value and connection to performance quality. An extensive dataset consisting of more than 19,000 tones played by 110 trumpet players of different expertise has been collected. A subset of 1,481 tones from this dataset was labeled by eight professional graders on a scale of 1 to 4 based on the perceived efficiency of sound production. Statistical analysis is performed to identify the correlation among the assigned ratings by the expert graders. A Random Forest classifier is trained using the mode of the ratings and its accuracy and variability is assessed with respect to the variability in human graders as a reference. An analysis of the important discriminatory features identifies stability of spectral peaks as a critical factor in trumpet timbre quality.;"Alberto Acquilino, Schulich School of Music, McGill University, CAN, education, Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT), CAN, facility;Ninad Puranik, Schulich School of Music, McGill University, CAN, education, Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT), CAN, facility;Ichiro Fujinaga, Schulich School of Music, McGill University, CAN, education;Gary Scavone, Schulich School of Music, McGill University, CAN, education";McGill University,McGill University,McGill University,McGill University;education, education, education, education;CAN, CAN, CAN, CAN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;28.85717;-21.081558

In this paper we provide a novel approach to infer this harmonic background from the score notation of a melody. We first construct a pitch context vector for each note in the melody. This vector summarises the pitches that are in the preceding and following contexts of the note. Next, we use these pitch context vectors to generate a list of candidate chords for each note. The candidate chords fit the pitch context of a given note each with a computed strength. Finally, we find an optimal path through the chord candidates, employing a score function for the fitness of a given candidate chord. The algorithm chooses one chord for each note, optimizing the total score. A set of heuristics is incorporated in the score function. The system is heavily parameterised, extremely flexible, and does not need training. This creates a framework to experiment with harmonization of melodies. The output is evaluated by an expert survey, which yields convincing and positive results.;"Peter van Kranenburg, Meertens Institute, Utrecht University, NLD, education;Eoin Kearns, Meertens Institute, NLD, facility";Meertens Institute, Meertens Institute;facility, facility;NLD, NLD;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-9.746873;-19.694473

Our proposed method mainly consists of 1) a hybrid CTC-Attention model for sequence-to-sequence automatic guitar transcription that uses tokenized music representation, and 2) two data augmentation methods for training the model. Our proposed model is a generic encoder-decoder Transformer model but adopts multi-task learning with CTC from the encoder to speed up learning alignments between the output tokens and acoustic features. Our proposed data augmentation methods scale up the amount of training data by 1) creating bar overlap when splitting an excerpt to be used for network input, and 2) by utilizing MIDI-only data to synthetically create audio-MIDI pair data. We confirmed that 1) the proposed data augmentation methods were highly effective for training generic Transformer models that generate tokenized outputs, 2) our proposed hybrid CTC-Attention model outperforms conventional methods that transcribe guitar performance with tokens, and 3) the addition of multi-task learning with CTC in our proposed model is especially effective when there is an insufficient amount of training data.;"Sehun Kim, Nagoya University, JPN, education;Kazuya Takeda, Nagoya University, JPN, education;Tomoki Toda, Nagoya University, JPN, education";Nagoya University, Nagoya University, Nagoya University;education, education, education;JPN, JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;34.803726;-40.883842
"Kento Watanabe;Masataka Goto";Text-to-Lyrics Generation With Image-Based Semantics and Reduced Risk of Plagiarism;2023;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10265309;This paper proposes a text-to-lyrics generation method, aiming to provide lyric writing support by suggesting the generated lyrics to users who struggle to find the right words to convey their message. Previous studies on lyrics generation have focused on generating lyrics based on semantic constraints such as specific keywords, lyric style, and topics. However, these methods had limitations because users could not freely input their intentions as text. Even if such intentions can be given as input text, the lyrics generated from the input tend to contain similar wording, making it difficult to inspire the user. Our method is therefore developed to generate lyrics that (1) convey a message similar to the input text and (2) contain wording different from the input text. A straightforward approach of training a text-to-lyrics encoder-decoder is not feasible since there is no text-lyric paired data for this purpose. To overcome this issue, we divide the text-to-lyrics generation process into a two-step pipeline, eliminating the need for text-lyric paired data. (a) First, we use an existing text-to-image generation technique as a text analyzer to obtain an image that captures the meaning of the input text, ignoring the wording. (b) Next, we use our proposed image-to-lyrics encoder-decoder (I2L) to generate lyrics from the obtained image while preserving its meaning. The training of this I2L model only requires pairs of lyrics and images generated from lyrics, which are readily prepared. In addition, we propose for the first time a lyrics generation method that reduces the risk of plagiarism by prohibiting the generation of uncommon phrases in the training data. Experimental results show that the proposed method can generate lyrics with different phrasing while conveying a message similar to the input text.;"Kento Watanabe, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, facility";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;facility, facility;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;3.6092346;49.366077

Due to the long sequential inputs, it is still challenging to model the global structure efficiently and to deal with the data imbalance between beats and no beats. In order to meet the above challenges, we propose a novel Transformer-based model consisting of a low-resolution encoder and a high-resolution decoder. The encoder with low temporal resolution is suited to capture global features with more balanced data. The decoder with high temporal resolution is designed to predict beat times at a desired resolution. In the decoder, the global structure is considered by the cross attention between the global features and high-dimensional features. There are two key modifications in the proposed model: (1) adding 1D convolutional layers in the encoder and (2) replacing positional embedding by the upsampled encoder features in the decoder. In the experiment, we achieved the state-of-the-art performance and showed that the decoder produced more precise and stable results.;"Tian Cheng, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility;Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology;facility, facility;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;56.720676;5.227947

Most of the recent MSS techniques are based on architectures with CNNs, RNNs, and attention-based transformers that take waveforms or complex spectrograms or both as inputs. For the growth of the research field, we believe it is important to study not only the current established methodologies but also diverse perspectives. Therefore, since the MLP-Mixer-based architecture has been reported to perform as well as or better than architectures with CNNs and transformers in the computer vision field despite the MLP's simple computation, we report a way to effectively apply such an architecture to MSS as a reusable insight. In this paper we propose a model called TFC-MLP, which is a variant of the MLP-Mixer architecture that preserves time-frequency positional relationships and mixes time, frequency, and channel dimensions separately, using complex spectrograms as input. The TFC-MLP was evaluated with source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) using the MUSDB18-HQ dataset.

However, what if it were possible to use a function to listen to only the choruses of each song in a playlist one after another? In this paper, we call this music listening concept chorus-playlist, and we investigate its potential impact from various perspectives such as the demand and the objectives for listening to music with chorus-playlist. To this end, we conducted a questionnaire-based online user survey involving 214 participants. Our analysis results suggest reusable insights, including the following: (1) We show a high demand for listening to existing playlists with the chorus-playlist approach. We also reveal preferred options for chorus playback, such as adding crossfade transitions between choruses. (2) People listen to playlists with chorus-playlist for various objectives. For example, when they listen to their own self-made playlists, they want to boost a mood or listen to music in a specific context such as work or driving. (3) There is also a high demand for playlist creation on the premise of continuous listening to only the choruses of the songs in a playlist.

Moreover, we propose and evaluate three factor-based functions that would enable more effectively browsing songs on a music streaming service. The user survey results provide several reusable insights, including the following: (1) for most participants, the melody and singing voice are important factors in judging whether they like a song on first listen; (2) personal characteristics do influence the important factors (e.g., participants who have high openness and are sensitive to beat deviations emphasize melody); and (3) the proposed functions each have a certain level of demand because they enable users to easily find music that fits their tastes.

This leads to research questions on whether these models can be used to learn representations for different music cultures and styles, or whether we can build similar music audio embedding models trained on data from different cultures or styles. To that end, we leverage transfer learning methods to derive insights about the similarities between the different music cultures to which the data belongs to. We use two Western music datasets, two traditional/folk datasets coming from eastern Mediterranean cultures, and two datasets belonging to Indian art music. Three deep audio embedding models are trained and transferred across domains, including two CNN-based and a Transformer-based architecture, to perform auto-tagging for each target domain dataset.

We then train baselines to predict and analyze music memorability, leveraging both interpretable features and audio mel-spectrograms as inputs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore music memorability using data-driven deep learning-based methods. Through a series of experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that while there is room for improvement, predicting music memorability with limited data is possible.

The model is capable of controllable music generation with two paradigms: internal control and external control. Internal control refers to the process in which users pre-define a part of the music and then let the model infill the rest, similar to the task of masked music generation (or music inpainting). External control conditions the model with external yet related information, such as chord, texture, or other features, via the cross-attention mechanism. We show that by using internal and external controls, Polyffusion unifies a wide range of music creation tasks, including melody generation given accompaniment, accompaniment generation given melody, arbitrary music segment inpainting, and music arrangement given chords or textures.

Experiments on two datasets suggest that our contrastive method outperforms single-modality embeddings and baseline algorithms for combining modalities, both in terms of artist retrieval accuracy and coverage. Improvements with respect to other methods are particularly significant for less popular query artists.

In practice, the boundary conditions may not be known a priori or may not satisfy such strict assumptions. This paper introduces an alignment algorithm called FlexDTW that is designed to handle a wide range of boundary conditions. FlexDTW allows alignment paths to start anywhere on the bottom or left edge of the cost matrix (adjacent to the origin) and to end anywhere on the top or right edge. In order to properly compare paths of very different lengths, we use a goodness measure that normalizes the cumulative path cost by the path length. The key insight of FlexDTW is that the Manhattan length of a path can be computed by simply knowing the starting point of the path, which can be computed recursively during dynamic programming. We artificially generate a suite of 16 benchmarks based on the Chopin Mazurka dataset in order to characterize audio alignment performance under a variety of boundary conditions. We show that FlexDTW has consistently strong performance that is comparable or better than commonly used alignment algorithms, and it is the only system with strong performance in some boundary conditions.;"Irmak Bükey, Pomona College, USA, education;Jason Zhang, University of Michigan, USA, education;TJ Tsai, Harvey Mudd College, USA, education";Pomona College, University of Michigan, Harvey Mudd College;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;46.938;-3.4137824

Such optimization tasks benefit from access to accurate gradients. However, typical audio synths incorporate components with discontinuities – such as sawtooth or square waveforms, or a categorical search over discrete parameters like a choice among such waveforms – that thwart conventional automatic differentiation (AD). AD libraries in frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch typically ignore discontinuities, providing incorrect gradients at such locations. Thus, SOTA parameter inference methods avoid differentiating the synth directly, and resort to workarounds such as genetic search or neural proxies. Instead, we adapt and extend recent computer graphics methods for differentiable rendering to directly differentiate the synth as a white box program, and thereby optimize its parameters using gradient descent. We evaluate our framework using a generic FM synth with ADSR, noise, and IIR filters, adapting its parameters to match a variety of target audio clips.

We explore the music adaption of SSL with two distinctive speech-related models, data2vec1.0 and Hubert, and refer to them as music2vec and musicHuBERT, respectively. We train 12 SSL models with 95M parameters under various pre-training configurations and systematically evaluate the MIR task performances with 13 different MIR tasks. Our findings suggest that training with music data can generally improve performance on MIR tasks, even when models are trained using paradigms designed for speech. However, we identify the limitations of such existing speech-oriented designs, especially in modelling polyphonic information. Based on the experimental results, empirical suggestions are also given for designing future musical SSL strategies and paradigms.;"Yinghao Ma, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Ruibin Yuan, Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, CHN, education, Carnegie Mellon University, USA, education;Yizhi Li, University of Sheffield, GBR, education;Ge Zhang, Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, CHN, education, University of Waterloo, CAN, education;Xingran Chen, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, USA, education;Hanzhi Yin, Carnegie Mellon University, USA, education;Chenghua Lin, University of Sheffield, GBR, education;Emmanouil Benetos, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;Anton Ragni, University of Sheffield, GBR, education;Norbert Gyenge, University of Sheffield, GBR, education;Ruibo Liu, Dartmouth College, USA, education;Gus Xia, New York University Shanghai, CHN, education;Roger Dannenberg, Carnegie Mellon University, USA, education;Yike Guo, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HKG, education;Jie Fu, Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, CHN, education";Queen Mary University of London, Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, University of Sheffield, Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, University of Michigan, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Sheffield, Queen Mary University of London, University of Sheffield, University of Sheffield, Dartmouth College, New York University Shanghai, Carnegie Mellon University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence;education, facility, education, facility, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, facility;GBR, CHN, GBR, CHN, USA, USA, GBR, GBR, GBR, GBR, USA, CHN, USA, HKG, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developing economies, Developed economies, Developing economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developing economies, Developed economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;-9.853714;11.664377
"Carey Bunks;Tillman Weyde;Simon Dixon;Bruno Di Giorgi";Modeling Harmonic Similarity for Jazz Using Co-occurrence Vectors and the Membrane Area;2023;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10265400;In jazz, measuring harmonic similarity is complicated by the common practice of reharmonization -the altering or substitution of chords without fundamentally changing the piece's harmonic identity. This is analogous to natural language processing tasks where synonymous terms can be used interchangeably without significantly modifying the meaning of a text. Our approach to modeling harmonic similarity borrows from NLP techniques, such as distributional semantics, by embedding chords into a vector space using a co-occurrence matrix. We show that the method can robustly detect harmonic similarity between songs, even when reharmonized. The co-occurrence matrix is computed from a corpus of symbolic jazz-chord progressions, and the result is a map from chords into vectors. A song's harmony can then be represented as a piecewise-linear path constructed from the cumulative sum of its chord vectors. For any two songs, their harmonic similarity can be measured as the minimal surface membrane area between their vector paths. Using a dataset of jazz contrafacts, we show that our approach reduces the median rank of matches from 318 to 18 compared to a baseline approach using pitch class vectors.;"Carey Bunks, Queen Mary University of London, UK, education, City, University of London, UK, education;Tillman Weyde, City, University of London, UK, education;Simon Dixon, Queen Mary University of London, UK, education;Bruno Di Giorgi, Apple, UK, company";Queen Mary University of London, City University London, Queen Mary University of London, Apple;education, education, education, company;GBR, GBR, GBR, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-9.0008135;0.094685115

We develop RT-MIR techniques aimed at augmenting percussive fingerstyle, which blends acoustic guitar playing with guitar body percussion. We formulate several design objectives for RT-MIR systems for augmented instrument performance: (i) causal constraint, (ii) perceptually negligible action-to-sound latency, (iii) control intimacy support, (iv) synthesis control support. We present and evaluate real-time guitar body percussion recognition and embedding learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and CNNs jointly trained with variational autoencoders (VAEs). We introduce a taxonomy of guitar body percussion based on hand part and location. We follow a cross-dataset evaluation approach by collecting three datasets labelled according to the taxonomy. The embedding quality of the models is assessed using KL-Divergence across distributions corresponding to different taxonomic classes. Results indicate that the networks are strong classifiers especially in a simplified 2-class recognition task, and the VAEs yield improved class separation compared to CNNs as evidenced by increased KL-Divergence across distributions. We argue that the VAE embedding quality could support control intimacy and rich interaction when the latent space's parameters are used to control an external synthesis engine.

Inspired by recent works that shed light on the role of the soloist, we offer a collection of 48 manually verified transcriptions of professional jazz bassists, comprising over 50,000 note events, which are based on the backing tracks used in the FiloSax dataset.

We then use FiloBass to enrich our understanding of jazz bass lines, by conducting a corpus-based musical analysis with a contrastive study of existing instructional methods. Together with the original FiloSax dataset, our work represents a significant step toward a fully annotated performance dataset for a jazz quartet setting.

Evidence from musicology and psychology research shows that gender-loaded messages can be reliably encoded and decoded via musical sounds. However, much of this evidence comes from examining music in isolation, while studies of the gendering of music within multimodal communicative events are sparse. In this paper, we outline a method to automatically analyse how music in TV advertising aimed at children may be deliberately used to reinforce traditional gender roles. Our dataset of 606 commercials included music-focused mid-level perceptual features, multimodal aesthetic emotions, and content analytical items. Despite its limited size, and because of the extreme gender polarisation inherent in toy advertisements, we obtained noteworthy results by leveraging multi-task transfer learning on our densely annotated dataset. The models were trained to categorise commercials based on their intended target audience, specifically distinguishing between masculine, feminine, and mixed audiences. Additionally, to provide explainability for the classification in gender targets, the models were jointly trained to perform regressions on emotion ratings across six scales, and on mid-level musical perceptual attributes across twelve scales.

GOLF employs a glottal model as the harmonic source and IIR filters to simulate the vocal tract, resulting in an interpretable and efficient approach.

YouTube differs from traditional music streaming services in that they provide a diverse range of music-related videos as well as soundtracks. However, notwithstanding the surge in the platform's utilization as a music consumption tool, there is a lack of thorough research on the phenomenon. To investigate its usability and interface satisfaction as a music listening tool, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 27 users who listen to music through YouTube more than three times a week. Our qualitative analysis found that YouTube has five main meanings for users as a music streaming service: 1) exploring musical diversity, 2) sharing unique playlists, 3) providing visual satisfaction, 4) facilitating user interaction, and 5) allowing free and easy access.

However, most existing unsupervised training strategies omit the notion of repetition and therefore fail at encompassing this essential aspect of music structure. This work introduces a triplet mining method which explicitly considers repeating sequences occurring inside a music track by leveraging common audio descriptors. We study its impact on the learned representations through downstream music segmentation. Because musical repetitions can be of different natures, we give further insight on the role of the audio descriptors employed at the triplet mining stage as well as the trade-off existing between the quality of the triplets mined and the quantity of unlabelled data used for training.

The SSL paradigm we use is equivariance to pitch transposition, which enables our model to accurately perform pitch estimation on monophonic audio after being trained only on a small unlabeled dataset. We use a lightweight (&lt; 30k parameters) Siamese neural network that takes as inputs two different pitch-shifted versions of the same audio represented by its constant-Q transform. To prevent the model from collapsing in an encoder-only setting, we propose a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective which captures pitch information. Furthermore, we design the architecture of our network to be transposition-preserving by introducing learnable Toeplitz matrices. We evaluate our model for the two tasks of singing voice and musical instrument pitch estimation and show that our model is able to generalize across tasks and datasets while being lightweight, hence remaining compatible with low-resource devices and suitable for real-time applications. In particular, our results surpass self-supervised baselines and narrow the performance gap between self-supervised and supervised methods for pitch estimation.";"Alain Riou, LTCI, Télécom-Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, FRA, education, Sony Computer Science Laboratories - Paris, FRA, company;Stefan Lattner, Sony Computer Science Laboratories - Paris, FRA, company;Gaëtan Hadjeres, Sony AI, company;Geoffroy Peeters, LTCI, Télécom-Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, FRA, education";Telecom ParisTech, Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Sony AI,Telecom ParisTech;education, company, company, education;FRA, FRA, JPN, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;43.177486;-2.3724215

However, the same level of progress has not been achieved for singing voices. To bridge this gap, we suggest a framework for training singer identity encoders to extract representations suitable for various singing-related tasks, such as singing voice similarity and synthesis. We explore different self-supervised learning techniques on a large collection of isolated vocal tracks and apply data augmentations during training to ensure that the representations are invariant to pitch and content variations. We evaluate the quality of the resulting representations on singer similarity and identification tasks across multiple datasets, with a particular emphasis on out-of-domain generalization. Our proposed framework produces high-quality embeddings that outperform both speaker verification and wav2vec 2.0 pre-trained baselines on singing voice while operating at 44.1 kHz.

"Changhong Wang;Gaël Richard;Brian McFee";Transfer Learning and Bias Correction With Pre-Trained Audio Embeddings;2023;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10265223;Deep neural network models have become the dominant approach to a large variety of tasks within music information retrieval (MIR). These models generally require large amounts of (annotated) training data to achieve high accuracy. Because not all applications in MIR have sufficient quantities of training data, it is becoming increasingly common to transfer models across domains. This approach allows representations derived for one task to be applied to another, and can result in high accuracy with less stringent training data requirements for the downstream task. However, the properties of pre-trained audio embeddings are not fully understood. Specifically, and unlike traditionally engineered features, the representations extracted from pre-trained deep networks may embed and propagate biases from the model's training regime. This work investigates the phenomenon of bias propagation in the context of pre-trained audio representations for the task of instrument recognition. We first demonstrate that three different pre-trained representations (VGGish, OpenL3, and YAMNet) exhibit comparable performance when constrained to a single dataset, but differ in their ability to generalize across datasets (OpenMIC and IRMAS). We then investigate dataset identity and genre distribution as potential sources of bias. Finally, we propose and evaluate post-processing countermeasures to mitigate the effects of bias, and improve generalization across datasets.;"Changhong Wang, LTCI, Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France, education;Gaël Richard, LTCI, Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France, education;Brian McFee, Music and Audio Research Laboratory, New York University, USA, education";Telecom ParisTech,Telecom ParisTech, New York University;education, education, education;FRA, FRA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;10.185942;-5.4121823

However, open datasets comprising isolated sources are few, small, and restricted to a few music styles. At the same time, multi-track datasets with source bleeding are usually found larger in size, and are easier to compile. In this work, we address the task of singing voice separation when the ground-truth signals have bleeding and only the target vocals and the corresponding mixture are available. We train a cold diffusion model on the frequency domain to iteratively transform a mixture into the corresponding vocals with bleeding. Next, we build the final separation masks by clustering spectrogram bins according to their evolution along the transformation steps. We test our approach on a Carnatic music scenario for which solely datasets with bleeding exist, while current research on this repertoire commonly uses source separation models trained solely with Western commercial music. Our evaluation on a Carnatic test set shows that our system improves Spleeter on interference removal and it is competitive in terms of signal distortion.

Most existing deep learning methods for music transcription do not capture these variations and often need frame-level annotations, which are scarce for the violin. In this paper, we propose a novel method for high-resolution violin transcription that can leverage piece-level weak labels for training. Our conformer-based model works on the raw audio waveform and transcribes violin notes and their corresponding pitch deviations with 5.8 ms frame resolution and 10-cent frequency resolution. We demonstrate that our method (1) outperforms generic systems in the proxy tasks of violin transcription and pitch estimation, and (2) can automatically generate new training labels by aligning its feature representations with unseen scores.

Score-Independent Detection of Conspicuous Mistakes in Piano Performances;2023;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10265297;In piano performance, some mistakes stand out to listeners, whereas others may go unnoticed. Former research concluded that the salience of mistakes depended on factors including their contextual appropriateness and a listener's degree of familiarity to what is being performed. A conspicuous error is considered to be an area where there is something obviously wrong with the performance, which a listener can detect regardless of their degree of knowledge of what is being performed. Analogously, this paper attempts to build a score-independent conspicuous error detector for standard piano repertoire of beginner to intermediate students. We gather three qualitatively different piano playing MIDI data: (1) 103 sight-reading sessions for beginning and intermediate adult pianists with formal music training, (2) 245 performances by presumably late-beginner to early-advanced pianists on a digital piano, and (3) 50 etude performances by an advanced pianist. The data was annotated at the regions considered to contain conspicuous mistakes. Then, we use a Temporal Convolutional Network to detect the sites of such mistakes from the piano roll. We investigate the use of two pre-training methods to overcome data scarcity: (1) synthetic data with procedurally-generated mistakes, and (2) training a part of the model as a piano roll auto-encoder. Experimental evaluation shows that the TCN performs at an F-measure of 0.78 without pretraining for sight-reading data, but the proposed pretraining steps improve the F-measure on performance and etude data, approaching the agreement between human raters on conspicuous error labels.

We build on top of existing spectrogram-based audio transformers such as AST and train our models on a supervised task using patchout training similar to PaSST. In contrast to previous works, we study how specific design decisions affect downstream music tagging tasks instead of focusing on the training task. We assess the impact of initializing the training with different existing weights, using various input audio segment lengths, using learned representations from different blocks and tokens of the transformer for downstream tasks, and applying patchout at inference to speed up feature extraction. We find that 1) initializing the audio training from ImageNet or AudioSet weights and longer input segments are beneficial both for the training and downstream tasks, 2) the best representations for the downstream tasks are located in the middle blocks of the transformer, and 3) using patchout at inference allows faster processing than our convolutional baselines while maintaining superior performance.

These rudiments are often practiced on silent practice pads using only the hands. Additionally, many percussive instruments across cultures are played exclusively with the hands. Building on these concepts and inspired by Einstein's probably apocryphal quote, Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler, we hypothesize that a dual-voice reduction could serve as a natural and meaningful compressed representation of multi-voiced drum patterns. This representation would retain more information than its corresponding monotonic representation while maintaining relative simplicity for tasks such as rhythm analysis and generation. To validate this potential representation, we investigate whether experienced drummers can consistently represent and reproduce the rhythmic essence of a given drum pattern using only their two hands.

Although the music information retrieval community has recently shown interest in this task, existing approaches mainly use machine-readable scores, leaving the broader case of sheet music images unaddressed. Based on previous works involving sheet music images, we use a mid-level representation, bootleg score, describing notehead positions relative to staff lines coupled with a transformer model. This architecture is adapted to our task by introducing a different encoding scheme that reduces the encoded sequence length to one-eighth of the original size. In terms of evaluation, we consider five datasets---more than 7500 scores with up to 9 difficulty levels---, two being mainly compiled for this work. The results obtained when pretraining the scheme on the IMSLP corpus and fine-tuning it on the considered datasets prove the proposal's validity, achieving the best-performing model with a balanced accuracy of 40.3\% and a mean square error of 1.3.

By examining a corpus of 400 monophonic Slovenian tunes, we are releasing annotations of structure, contour, and implied harmony. We propose an efficient algorithm based on suffix arrays and bit-vectors to match both music content (melodic sequence) and context (descriptors). Our study reveals that certain descriptors, such as contour types and harmonic stability exhibit variations based on phrase position within a tune. Additionally, combining melody and descriptors in pattern-matching queries enhances precision for classification tasks. We emphasize the importance of the interplay between melodic sequences and music descriptors, highlighting that different pattern queries may have varying levels of detail requirements.

As a complement to standard score notation, tablatures transcribe performance gesture information including finger positions and a variety of guitar-specific playing techniques such as slides, hammer-on/pull-off or bends. This paper focuses on bends, which enable to progressively shift the pitch of a note, therefore circumventing physical limitations of the discrete fretted fingerboard. In this paper, we propose a set of 25 high-level features, computed for each note of the tablature, to study how bend occurrences can be predicted from their past and future short-term context. Experiments are performed on a corpus of 932 lead guitar tablatures of popular music and show that a decision tree successfully predicts bend occurrences with an F1 score of 0.71 and a limited amount of false positive predictions, demonstrating promising applications to assist the arrangement of non-guitar music into guitar tablatures.;"Alexandre D’Hooge, Univ.

A melodic contour or harmonic progression can be shaped into a wide variety of different rhythms, densities, or combinations of layers. Instead of describing these textural organizations only locally, using existing formalisms, we question how these parameters may evolve throughout a musical piece, and more specifically how much they change. Hence, we define several distance functions to compare texture between two musical bars, based either on textural labels annotated with a dedicated syntax, or on symbolic scores. We propose an evaluation methodology based on textural heterogeneity and contrasts in classical Thema and Variations using the TAVERN dataset.

In the standard OMR workflow, layout analysis is a critical component for identifying relevant parts of the image, such as staff lines, text, or notes. State-of-the-art approaches to this task are based on machine learning, which entails having to label a training corpus, an error-prone, laborious, and expensive task that must be performed by experts. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot strategy for building robust models by utilizing only partial annotations, therefore requiring minimal human effort. Specifically, we introduce a masking layer and an oversampling technique to train models using a small set of annotated patches from the training images. Our proposal enables achieving high performance even with scarce training data, as demonstrated by experiments on four benchmark datasets.

Thanks to recent advances in computer vision and deep learning, there are successful approaches that can locate the music-notation elements from a given music score image. Once detected, these elements must be related to each other to reconstruct the musical notation itself, in the so-called notation assembly stage. However, despite its relevance in the eventual success of the OMR, this stage has been barely addressed in the literature. This work presents a set of neural approaches to perform this assembly stage. Taking into account the number of possible syntactic relationships in a music score, we give special importance to the efficiency of the process in order to obtain useful models in practice. Our experiments, using the MUSCIMA++ handwritten sheet music dataset, show that the considered approaches are capable of outperforming the existing state of the art in terms of efficiency with limited (or no) performance degradation.

Each participating country is able to evaluate every other country's performance via a combination of rankings from professional jurors and telephone votes from viewers. Between fan sites and the official Song Contest organisation, a complete historical record of musical performances and country-to-country contest scores is available, back to the very first edition in 1956, and for the most recent contests, there is also information about each individual juror's rankings. In this paper, we introduce MIRoVision, a set of scripts which collates the data from these sources into a single, easy-to-use dataset, and a discrete-choice model to convert the raw contest scores into a stable, interval-scale measure of the quality of Eurovision Song Contest entries across the years.

While previous work has mostly focused on piano, this paper concentrates on rhythm guitar, which is especially popular with amateur musicians and has a broad skill spectrum. This paper proposes a rubric-based 'playability' metric to formalise this spectrum. The rubric comprises seven criteria that contribute to a single playability score, representing the overall difficulty of a song. The rubric was created through interviewing and incorporating feedback from guitar teachers and experts. Additionally, we introduce the playability prediction task by adding annotations to a subset of 200 songs from the McGill Billboard dataset, labelled by a guitar expert using the proposed rubric. We use this dataset to weight each rubric criterion for maximal reliability. Finally, we create a rule-based baseline to score each rubric criterion automatically from chord annotations and timings, and compare this baseline against simple deep learning models trained on chord symbols and textual representations of guitar tablature. The rubric, dataset, and baselines lay a foundation for understanding what makes songs easy or difficult for guitar players and how we can use MIR tools to match amateurs with songs closer to their skill level.;"Marcel A.

In this paper, we propose an input feature modification and a training objective modification based on two assumptions. First, harmonics in the spectrograms of audio data decay rapidly along the frequency axis. To enhance the model's sensitivity on the trailing harmonics, we modify the Combined Frequency and Periodicity (CFP) representation using discrete z-transform. Second, the vocal and non-vocal segments with extremely short duration are uncommon. To ensure a more stable melody contour, we design a differentiable loss function that prevents the model from predicting such segments. We apply these modifications to several models, including MSNet, FTANet, and a newly introduced model, PianoNet, modified from a piano transcription network.

George Sioros;Polyrhythmic Modelling of Non-Isochronous and Microtiming Patterns;2023;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10265245;Computational models and analyses of musical rhythms are predominantly based on the subdivision of durations down to a common isochronous pulse, which plays a fundamental structural role in the organization of their durational patterns. Meter, the most widespread example of such a temporal scheme, consists of several hierarchically organized pulses. Deviations from isochrony found in musical patterns are considered to form an expressive, micro level of organization that is distinct from the structural macro-organization of the basic pulse. However, polyrhythmic structures, such as those found in music from West Africa or the African diaspora, challenge both the hierarchical subdivision of durations and the structural isochrony of the above models. Here we present a model that integrates the macroand micro-organization of rhythms by generating non-isochronous girds from isochronous pulses within a polyrhythmic structure. Observed micro-timing patterns may then be generated from structural non-isochronous grids, rather than being understood as expressive deviations from isochrony. We examine the basic mathematical properties of the model and show that meter can be generated as a special case. Finally, we demonstrate the model in the analysis of micro-timing patterns observed in Brazilian samba performances.;George Sioros, University of Plymouth, GBR, education;University of Plymouth;education;GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;49.993015;9.18147

Receiving constructive feedback on one's playing is crucial for improvement. However, personal feedback from an expert instructor is seldom available on demand. The goal motivating this project is to build software that will provide comparably useful feedback to beginners, in order to supplement feedback from human instructors. To lay the groundwork for that, in this paper we investigate performance assessment criteria from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. We gathered 83 piano performances from 21 players. Each recording was evaluated by both expert piano instructors and novice players. This dataset is unique in that the novice evaluators are also players, and that both quantitative and qualitative evaluations are collected. Our analysis of the evaluations indicates that the kind of specific, concrete piano techniques that are most elusive to novice evaluators are precisely the kind of characteristics that can be detected, measured, and visualized for learners by a well-designed software tool.;Yucong Jiang, University of Richmond, USA, education;University of Richmond;education;USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-0.41438115;-39.56224

The task consists of two components: recognizing harmony labels and finding their time boundaries. Most of the previous attempts focused on the first component, while time boundaries were rarely modeled explicitly. Lack of boundary modeling in the objective function could lead to segmentation errors. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach named Harana, to jointly detect the labels and boundaries of harmonic regions using neural semi-CRF (conditional random field). In contrast to rule-based scores used in traditional semi-CRF, a neural score function is proposed to incorporate features with more representational power. To improve the robustness of the model to imperfect harmony profiles, we design an additional score component to penalize the match between the candidate harmony label and the absent notes in the music. Quantitative results from our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach improves segmentation quality as well as frame-level accuracy compared to previous methods.;"Qiaoyu Yang, University of Rochester, USA, education;Frank Cwitkowitz, University of Rochester, USA, education;Zhiyao Duan, University of Rochester, USA, education";University of Rochester, University of Rochester, University of Rochester;education, education, education;USA, USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;22.856226;-38.76356

For these mappings, we use dimensionality reduction or clustering to assign similar segments to similar colors and vice versa. To provide a better overview, we further designed simplified music notation representations, including hierarchical and compressed encodings. These overviews allow users to display whole pieces more compactly on a single screen without clutter and to find and navigate to distant segments more quickly.

Even if they do not have musical knowledge, such as about chord progressions and instruments, users can try various text prompts to generate audio. However, compared to the image domain, gaining a clear understanding of the space of possible music audios is difficult because users cannot listen to the variations of the generated audios simultaneously. We therefore facilitate users in exploring not only text prompts but also audio priors that constrain the text-to-audio music generation process. This dual-sided exploration enables users to discern the impact of different text prompts and audio priors on the generation results through iterative comparison of them. Our developed interface, IteraTTA, is specifically designed to aid users in refining text prompts and selecting favorable audio priors from the generated audios. With this, users can progressively reach their loosely-specified goals while understanding and exploring the space of possible results.

However, a more desirable future path is most likely somewhere in between these two polar opposites where productive and ethical human-AI collaboration could happen through the use of these tools. To explore this possibility, we first need to improve our understanding of how music creators perceive and utilize these types of tools in their creative process.

Therefore, it is essential to consider all stakeholders' goals and values when developing and evaluating the music recommender systems integrated into these services. One vital goal is treating artists fairly, thereby giving them a fair chance to have their music recommended and listened to, and subsequently building a fan base. Such artist fairness is often assumed to have a trade-off with user goals such as satisfaction. Using insights from two studies, this work shows the opposite: some goals from different stakeholders are complementary. Our first study, in which we interview music artists, demonstrates that they often see increased transparency and control for users as a means to also improve artist fairness.

We present a methodology based on training a neural model with synthetic images, thus reducing the difficulty of obtaining labeled data. As sheet music renderings depict regular visual characteristics compared to scores from real collections, we propose an unsupervised neural adaptation approach consisting of loss functions that promote alignment between the features learned by the model and those of the target collection while preventing the model from converging to undesirable solutions. This unsupervised adaptation bypasses the need for extensive retraining, requiring only the unlabeled target images.

Such benchmark metrics do not provide insights into the transcription quality of specific musical aspects such as articulation, dynamics, or rhythmic precision of the output, which are essential in the context of expressive performance analysis. Furthermore, in recent years, MAESTRO has become the de-facto training and evaluation dataset for such models. However, inference performance has been observed to deteriorate substantially when applied on out-of-distribution data, thereby questioning the suitability and reliability of transcribed outputs from such models for specific MIR tasks. In this work, we investigate the performance of three state-of-the-art piano transcription models in two experiments. In the first one, we propose a variety of musically informed evaluation metrics which, in contrast to the IR metrics, offer more detailed insight into the musical quality of the transcriptions. In the second experiment, we compare inference performance on real-world and perturbed audio recordings, and highlight musical dimensions which our metrics can help explain. Our experimental results highlight the weaknesses of existing piano transcription metrics and contribute to a more musically sound error analysis of transcription outputs.;"Patricia Hu, Johannes Kepler University, AUT, education;   Lukáš Samuel Marták, Johannes Kepler University, AUT, education;   Carlos Eduardo Cancino-Chacón, Johannes Kepler University, AUT, education;   Gerhard Widmer, Johannes Kepler University, AUT, education";Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University;education, education, education, education;AUT, AUT, AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;4.4250045;-37.17915
"Tsung-Ping Chen; Kazuyoshi Yoshii";Learning Multifaceted Self-Similarity over Time and Frequency for Music Structure Analysis;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_12.html;This paper describes a deep learning method for music structure analysis (MSA) that aims to split a music signal into temporal segments and assign a function label (e.g., intro, verse, or chorus) to each segment. The computational base for MSA is a spectro-temporal representation of input audio such as the spectrogram, where the compositional relationships of the spectral components provide valuable clues (e.g., chords) to the identification of structural units. However, such implicit features might be vulnerable to local operations such as convolution and pooling operations. In this paper, we hypothesize that the self-attention over the spectral domain as well as the temporal domain plays a key role in tackling MSA. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a novel MSA model built on the Transformer-in-Transformer architecture that alternately stacks spectral and temporal self-attention layers. Experiments with the Beatles, RWC, and SALAMI datasets showed the superiority of the dual-aspect self-attention. In particular, the differentiation between spectral and temporal self-attentions can provide extra performance gain. By analyzing the attention maps, we also demonstrate that self-attention can unfold tonal relationships and the internal structure of music.;"Tsung-Ping Chen, Kyoto University, JPN, education;   Kazuyoshi Yoshii, Kyoto University, JPN, education";Kyoto University, Kyoto University;education, education;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-3.1956742;9.539456
"Sujoy Roychowdhury; Preeti Rao; Sharat Chandran";Human Pose Estimation for Expressive Movement Descriptors in Vocal Musical Performance;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_273.html;Vocal concerts in Indian music are invariably associated with the   performers’ hand gesticulations that are believed to convey emotion, music semantics as well as the individual style of the   performers. Video recordings, with one or more cameras, along with markerless human pose estimation algorithms can be employed to capture such movements, and thus potentially solve music information retrieval (MIR) queries.  Nevertheless, off-the-shelf algorithms are built for the most part for upright human configurations contrasting with seated positions in Indian vocal concerts and the upper body movements in the context of performing music.  Current state-of-the-art algorithms are black box neural network based and this calls for an investigation of the components of such algorithms.  Key decisions involve the choice of one or more cameras, the choice of 2D or 3D features, and relevant parameters. such as confidence thresholds in common machine learning methods.

The main theme of symbolic music generation primarily encompasses the preprocessing of raw audio data and the implementation of a deep learning framework. Current techniques dedicated to symbolic music generation generally encounter two significant challenges: training data's lack of information about chords and scales and the requirement of specially designed model architecture adapted to the unique format of symbolic music representation. In this paper, we solve the above problems by introducing new symbolic music representation with MusicLang chord analysis model. We propose our MMT-BERT architecture adapting to the representation. To build a robust multitrack music generator, we fine-tune a pre-trained MusicBERT model to serve as the discriminator, and incorporate relativistic standard loss. This approach, supported by the in-depth understanding of symbolic music encoded within MusicBERT, fortifies the consonance and humanity of music generated by our method.

Some fear that the adoption of AI is poised to result in massive job destruction; others sense it will jeopardize and eventually upend all legal frameworks of intellectual property. AI, however, is not the first instance where humanity has confronted the prospect of machines emulating musical creativity. Already in the Baroque, various modes of musical artificiality were explored, ranging from automata and organ stops mimicking human performance and natural sounds, up to devices for mechanized composition (e.g., Athanasius Kircher, Johann Philip Kirnberger, C.P.E. Bach, Antonio Calegari and Diederich Nickolaus Winkel).   Valuable insights emerge from the reconsideration—and digital implementation—of these curiosities through the lens of present-day generative models. It can be argued that the very notion of ‘artificiality’ has presented humanity with long-standing philosophical dilemmas, in addressing the debate on the role of art as a substitute of (divine) nature.

"Julian Lenz; Anirudh Mani";A Generative Framework for Expressive Musical Ideas and Variations;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_315.html;We introduce Cadenza, a new multi-stage generative framework for predicting expressive variations of symbolic musical ideas as well as unconditional generations. To accomplish this we introduce a novel MIDI encoding method, PerTok (Performance Tokenizer) that captures minute expressive details whilst maintaining short sequence length and vocabulary sizes for polyphonic, monophonic and rhythmic tasks. The proposed framework comprises two sequential stages: 1) Composer and 2) Performer. The Composer model is a transformer-based Variational Autoencoder (VAE), with Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) and an autoregressive decoder modified to more effectively integrate the latent codes of the input musical idea. The Performer model is a bidirectional transformer encoder that is separately trained to predict velocities and microtimings on MIDI sequences. Extensive human evaluations demonstrate Cadenza's versatile capabilities in both meeting and surpassing the musical quality of other state-of-the-art symbolic models in unconditional generation, and secondly, composing new, expressive ideas that are both stylistically related to the input whilst providing novel ideas to the user. Our framework is designed, researched and implemented with the objective of ethically providing inspiration for musicians.;"Julian Lenz, Lemonaide, unknown, company;   Anirudh Mani, Lemonaide, unknown, company";Lemonaide, Lemonaide;company, company;unknown, unknown;NOT_FOUND;;;-2.902267;-19.65213

However, the potential for a one-to-many emulation strategy remains an avenue yet to be explored. This paper presents such an attempt that utilizes conditioning mechanisms to emulate multiple guitar amplifiers through a single neural model. For condition representation, we use contrastive learning to build a tone embedding encoder designed to distill and encode the distinctive style-related features of various amplifiers, leveraging a dataset of comprehensive amplifier settings. Targeting zero-shot application scenarios, we also examine various strategies for tone embedding representation, evaluating referenced tone embedding against two retrieval-based embedding methods for amplifiers unseen in the training time.

Despite its steady improvements along previous generations from audio feature dimensionality reduction to short query identification, the system is found to be vulnerable to audios with noise and ambiguous melody when extracting musical information from constant-Q transformation (CQT) spectrograms. Although some recent studies suggest that incorporating lyric-related features can enhance the overall performance of CSI systems, this approach typically requires training a separate automatic lyric recognition (ALR) model to extract lyric-related features from music recordings. In this work, we introduce X-Cover, the latest CSI system that incorporates a pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) module, Whisper, to extract and integrate lyrics-related features into modelling. Specifically, we jointly fine-tune the ASR block and the previous ByteCover3 system in a parameter-efficient fashion, which largely reduces the cost of using lyric information compared to training a new ALR model from scratch.

In the field of Music Emotion Recognition (MER), recent efforts have been made to predict listeners' time-varying perceived emotions using machine-learning models. However, interpreting these models has been challenging due to their black-box nature. To increase the explainability of models for subjective emotional experiences, we focus on composers’ emotional intentions. Our study aims to determine which audio features effectively predict both composers' time-varying emotions and listeners' perceived emotions. Seven composers performed 18 piano improvisations expressing three types of emotions (joy/happiness, sadness, and anger), which were then listened to by 36 participants in a laboratory setting. Both composers and listeners continuously assessed the emotional valence of the music clips on a 9-point scale (1: 'very negative' to 9: 'very positive'). Linear mixed-effect models analysis revealed that listeners significantly perceived the composers' intended emotions. Regarding audio features, the RMS was found to modulate the degree to which the listener's perceived emotion resembled the composer's emotion across all emotions. Moreover, the significant audio features that influenced this relationship varied depending on the emotion type. We propose that audio features related to the emotional responses of composers-listeners can be considered key factors in predicting listeners' emotional responses.;"Eun Ji Oh, KAIST, KOR, education;   Hyunjae Kim, KAIST, KOR, education;   Kyung Myun Lee, KAIST, KOR, education";KAIST, KAIST, KAIST;education, education, education;KOR, KOR, KOR;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;-28.385992;55.981487

In this article, we present an investigation into the robustness and generalisation capability of a lossy audio identification model. Our contributions are as follows. (1) We show the lack of robustness to codec parameter variations of a model equivalent to prior art. In particular, when naively training a lossy compression detection model on a dataset of music recordings processed with a range of codecs and their lossless counterparts, we obtain near perfect performance metrics on the held-out test set, but severely degraded performance on lossy tracks produced with codec parameters not seen in training.

In this study, we propose a probabilistic representation learning method for multimodal MIR based on contrastive learning and optimal transport. Our method trains encoders that map each content item to a hypersphere so that the probability distributions of a positive pair of content items become close to each other, while those of an irrelevant pair are far apart. To achieve such training, we design novel loss functions that utilize both probabilistic contrastive learning and spherical sliced-Wasserstein distances.

The culmination of NLP is the speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) task, referring to translation and synthesis of human speech. A disparity between S2ST and the possible adaptation to the singing domain, which we describe as singing-voice to singing-voice translation (SV2SVT), is becoming prominent as the former is progressing ever faster, while the latter is at a standstill. Singing-voice synthesis systems are overcoming the barrier of multi-lingual synthesis, despite limited attention has been paid to multi-lingual songwriting and song translation. This paper endeavors to determine what is required for successful SV2SVT and proposes PolySinger (Polyglot Singer): the first system for SV2SVT, performing lyrics translation from English to Japanese. A cascaded approach is proposed to establish a framework with a high degree of control which can potentially diminish the disparity between SV2SVT and S2ST. The performance of PolySinger is evaluated by a mean opinion score test with native Japanese speakers.

However, combining loops requires a nuanced understanding of musical compatibility that can be difficult to learn and time-consuming. This study concentrates on the 'vertical problem' of music loop compatibility, which pertains to layering different loops to create a harmonious blend. The main limitation to applying deep learning in this domain is the absence of a large, high-quality, labeled dataset containing both positive and negative pairs. To address this, we synthesize high-quality audio from multi-track MIDI datasets containing independent instrument stems, and then extract loops to serve as positive pairs. This provides models with instrument-level information when learning compatibility. Moreover, we improve the generation of negative examples by matching the key and tempo of candidate loops, and then employing AutoMashUpper to identify incompatible loops. Creating a large dataset allows us to introduce and examine the application of Transformer architectures for addressing vertical loop compatibility. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, achieving an 18.6\% higher accuracy across multiple genres.

After removing vocals from the recordings with a deep learning source separation technique, we further process the instrumental segments using non-negative matrix factorization and select the bell components. Then, we compute a tempo-agnostic rhythmic feature from the bell track and use it to cluster the data. Finally, we use synthesized patterns from the musicological literature about Candomblé as references to propagate labels to the rhythmic clusters in our data. This semi-supervised approach to pattern analysis precludes the need for downbeat and cycle annotations, making it particularly suited for extensive archive investigations.

Methods addressing this task commonly rely on sequence alignment algorithms such as Hidden Markov Models or Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) applied directly to note or onset sequences.

At the heart of our approach lies a transformer encoder network --- TheGlueNote --- which predicts pairwise note similarities for two 512 note subsequences. We postprocess the predicted similarities using flavors of weightedDTW and pitch-separated onsetDTW to retrieve note matches for two sequences of arbitrary length.

Japanese idol-group songs, vital to Japanese pop culture, feature a unique vocal arrangement style, where songs are divided into several segments, and a specific individual or multiple singers are assigned to each segment. To enhance singer diarization methods for recognizing such structures, we constructed FruitsMusic as a resource using 40 music videos of Japanese idol groups from YouTube. The corpus includes detailed annotations, covering songs across various genres, division and assignment styles, and groups ranging from 4 to 9 members. FruitsMusic also facilitates the development of various music information retrieval techniques, such as lyrics transcription and singer identification, benefiting not only Japanese idol-group songs but also a wide range of songs featuring single or multiple singers from various cultures. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of FruitsMusic, including its creation methodology and unique characteristics compared to conversational speech. Additionally, this paper evaluates the efficacy of current methods for singer embedding extraction and diarization in challenging real-world conditions using FruitsMusic.

"Andrew M. Demetriou; Jaehun Kim; Cynthia Liem";Towards Automated Personal Value Estimation in Song Lyrics;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_335.html;Most music widely consumed in Western Countries contains song lyrics, with U.S. samples reporting almost all of their song libraries contain lyrics. In parallel, social science theory suggests that personal values - the abstract goals that guide our decisions and behaviors - play an important role in communication: we share what is important to us to coordinate efforts, solve problems and meet challenges. Thus, the values communicated in song lyrics may be similar or different to those of the listener, and by extension affect the listener's reaction to the song. This suggests that working towards automated estimation of values in lyrics may assist in downstream MIR tasks, in particular, personlization. However, as highly subjective text, song lyrics present a challenge in terms of sampling songs to be annotated, annotation methods, and in choosing a method for aggregation. In this project, we take a perspectivist approach, guided by social science theory, to gathering annotations, estimating their quality, and aggregating them. We then compare aggregated ratings to estimates based on pre-trained sentence/word embedding models by employing a validated value dictionary. We discuss conceptually 'fuzzy' solutions to sampling and annotation challenges, promising initial results in annotation quality and in automated estimations, and future directions.;"Andrew M.

To achieve high temporal accuracy, synchronization approaches integrate onset-related information extracted from music recordings using either traditional signal processing techniques or exploiting symbolic representations obtained by data-driven automatic music transcription (AMT) approaches. In line with this research direction, our paper introduces a high-resolution synchronization approach that combines recent AMT techniques with traditional synchronization methods. Rather than relying on the final symbolic AMT results, we show how to exploit raw onset and frame predictions obtained as intermediate outcomes from a state-of-the-art AMT approach. Through extensive evaluations conducted on piano recordings under varied acoustic conditions across different transcription models, audio features, and dynamic time warping variants, we illustrate the advantages of our proposed method in both audio–audio and audio–score synchronization tasks. Specifically, we emphasize the effectiveness of our approach in aligning historical piano recordings with poor audio quality. We underscore how additional fine-tuning steps of the transcription model on the target dataset enhance alignment robustness, even in challenging acoustic environments.;"Johannes Zeitler, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, facility;   Ben Maman, Tel Aviv University, ISR, education;   Meinard Müller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, facility";International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Tel Aviv University, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen;facility, education, facility;DEU, ISR, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developing economies, Developed economies;32.169487;14.392681

This task is challenging due to the intricate spectral variations inherent in music signals, which convey melody, harmonics, and timbres of diverse instruments. In this paper, we introduce Mel-RoFormer, a spectrogram-based model featuring two key designs: a novel Mel-band Projection module at the front-end to enhance the model's capability to capture informative features across multiple frequency bands, and interleaved RoPE Transformers to explicitly model the frequency and time dimensions as two separate sequences. We apply Mel-RoFormer to tackle two essential MIR tasks: vocal separation and vocal melody transcription, aimed at isolating singing voices from audio mixtures and transcribing their lead melodies, respectively. Despite their shared focus on singing signals, these tasks possess distinct optimization objectives. Instead of training a unified model, we adopt a two-step approach. Initially, we train a vocal separation model, which subsequently serves as a foundation model for fine-tuning for vocal melody transcription. Through extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, we showcase that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance in both vocal separation and melody transcription tasks, underscoring the efficacy and versatility of Mel-RoFormer in modeling complex music audio signals.;"Ju-Chiang Wang, ByteDance, CHN, company;   Wei-Tsung Lu, New York University, USA, education;   Jitong Chen, ByteDance, CHN, company";ByteDance, New York University, ByteDance;company, education, company;CHN, USA, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developed economies, Developing economies;36.54384;-16.502066

The problem of generating tablature from a symbolic music representation involves inferring this string and fret assignment per note across an entire composition or performance. On the guitar, multiple string-fret assignments are possible for each pitch, which leads to a large combinatorial space that prevents exhaustive search approaches. Most modern methods use constraint-based dynamic programming approaches to minimize some cost function (e.g. hand position movement). In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning solution to symbolic guitar tablature estimation. We train an encoder-decoder Transformer model in a masked language modeling paradigm to assign notes to strings. The model is first pre-trained on DadaGP, a dataset of over 25K tablatures, and then fine-tuned on a curated set of professionally transcribed guitar performances. Given the subjective nature of assessing tablature quality, we conduct a user study amongst guitarists, wherein we ask participants to rate the playability of multiple versions of tablature for the same four-bar excerpt.

However, some existing audio autoencoders have limitations, such as multi-stage training procedures, slow iterative sampling, or low reconstruction quality. We introduce Music2Latent, an audio autoencoder that overcomes these limitations by leveraging consistency models. Music2Latent encodes samples into a compressed continuous latent space in a single end-to-end training process while enabling high-fidelity single-step reconstruction. Key innovations include conditioning the consistency model on upsampled encoder outputs at all levels through cross connections, using frequency-wise self-attention to capture long-range frequency dependencies, and employing frequency-wise learned scaling to handle varying value distributions across frequencies at different noise levels.  We demonstrate that Music2Latent outperforms existing continuous audio autoencoders in sound quality and reconstruction accuracy while achieving competitive performance on downstream MIR tasks using its latent representations.

Prior works aim to learn various emotions at once, leading to inadequate modeling. This paper explores the disentanglement of emotions in piano performance generation through a two-stage framework. The first stage focuses on valence modeling of lead sheet, and the second stage addresses arousal modeling by introducing performance-level attributes. To further capture features that shape  valence, an aspect less explored by previous approaches, we introduce a novel functional representation of symbolic music. This representation aims to capture the emotional impact of major-minor tonality, as well as the interactions among notes, chords, and key signatures. Objective and subjective experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework in both emotional valence and arousal modeling.

However, automatic analysis of musical dynamics for singing voice has received limited attention partly due to the scarcity of suitable datasets and a lack of clear evaluation frameworks. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology for dataset curation. Employing the proposed methodology, we compile a dataset comprising 509 musical dynamics annotated singing voice  performances, aligned with 163 score files, leveraging state-of-the-art source separation and alignment techniques. The scores are sourced from the OpenScore Lieder corpus of romantic-era compositions, widely known for its wealth of expressive annotations. Utilizing the curated dataset, we train a multi-head attention based CNN model with varying window sizes to evaluate the effectiveness of estimating musical dynamics. We explored two distinct perceptually motivated input representations for the model training: log-Mel spectrum and bark-scale based features. For testing, we manually curate another dataset of 25 musical dynamics annotated performances in collaboration with a professional vocalist.

Although text-to-music generation is getting largely adopted by the general public, explicit control and example-based style transfer are more adequate modalities to capture the intents of artists and musicians.   In this paper, we aim to unify explicit control and style transfer within a single model by separating local and global information to capture musical structure and timbre respectively. To do so, we leverage the capabilities of diffusion autoencoders to extract semantic features, in order to build two representation spaces. We enforce disentanglement between those spaces using an adversarial criterion and a two-stage training strategy. Our resulting model can generate audio matching a timbre target, while specifying structure either with explicit controls or through another audio example. We evaluate our model on one-shot timbre transfer and MIDI-to-audio tasks on instrumental recordings and show that we outperform existing baselines in terms of audio quality and target fidelity.

In the latter, musical information is often reduced to basic features, i.e. durations, pitches and velocities. Most existing works then rely on generic tokenization strategies from classical natural language processing, or matrix representations, e.g. piano roll. In this work, we evaluate how enriched representations of symbolic data can impact deep models, i.e. Transformers and RNN, for music style classification. In particular, we examine representations that explicitly incorporate musical information implicitly present in MIDI-like encodings, such as rhythmic organization, and show that they outperform generic tokenization strategies.

While the importance of temporal alignment varies across different contexts, achieving precise temporal synchronization is a prominent goal in musical performances. Musicians often incorporate expressive timing variations, which require precise control over timing and synchronization, particularly in ensemble performance. This is crucial because both deliberate expressive nuances and accidental timing deviations can affect the overall timing of a performance. This discussion prompts the question of how musicians adjust their temporal dynamics to achieve synchronization within an ensemble.

Existing approaches for this task often train a neural network to estimate control parameters for a set of audio effects. However, generalization of these systems is limited due to their reliance on synthetic training data and differentiable audio effects. In this work, we introduce ST-ITO, Style Transfer with Inference-Time Optimization, an approach that instead searches the parameter space of an audio effect chain at inference. This method enables control of arbitrary audio effect chains, including unseen and non-differentiable effects. Our approach employs a learned metric of audio production style, which we train through a simple and scalable self-supervised pretraining strategy, along with a gradient-free optimizer. Due to the limited existing evaluation methods for audio production style transfer, we introduce a four-part benchmark to comprehensively evaluate both audio production style metrics and style transfer systems. This evaluation demonstrates that our approach enables more expressive style transfer and improved generalization, highlighting the limitations of synthetic training data and differentiable audio effects.;"Christian J.

"Yujia Yan; Zhiyao Duan";Scoring Time Intervals Using Non-Hierarchical Transformer for Automatic Piano Transcription;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_382.html;The neural semi-Markov Conditional Random Field (semi-CRF) framework has demonstrated promise for event-based piano transcription. In this framework, all events (notes or pedals) are represented as closed time intervals tied to specific event types. The neural semi-CRF approach requires an interval scoring matrix that assigns a score for every candidate interval. However, designing an efficient and expressive architecture for scoring intervals is not trivial. This paper introduces a simple method for scoring intervals using scaled inner product operations that resemble how attention scoring is done in transformers. We show theoretically that, due to the special structure from encoding the non-overlapping intervals, under a mild condition, the inner product operations are expressive enough to represent an ideal scoring matrix that can yield the correct transcription result. We then demonstrate that an encoder-only structured non-hierarchical transformer backbone, operating only on a low-time-resolution feature map, is capable of transcribing piano notes and pedals with high accuracy and time precision. The experiment shows that our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks in terms of the F1 measure on the Maestro dataset.;"Yujia Yan, University of Rochester, USA, education;   Zhiyao Duan, University of Rochester, USA, education";University of Rochester, University of Rochester;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;7.702825;-39.59951
Malcolm Sailor;Fine-Tuning a Masked Language Model for Roman Numeral Analysis;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_322.html;Music is plentiful, but labeled data for music theory tasks like roman numeral analysis is scarce. Self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled data is therefore a promising means of improving performance on these tasks, especially because, during pretraining, a model may be expected to acquire latent representations of musical abstractions like keys and chords. However, existing deep learning models for roman numeral analysis have not used pretraining, instead training from scratch on labeled data, while conversely, pretrained models for music understanding have generally been applied to sequence-level tasks not involving explicit music theory, like composer or genre classification. In contrast, this paper applies pretraining methods to a music theory task by fine-tuning a masked language model, MusicBERT, for roman numeral analysis. We apply token classification to predict labels for each note, then aggregate the predictions of simultaneous notes to obtain a single label at each time step. Conditioning the chord predictions on key predictions gives more coherent labels. The resulting model outperforms previous roman numeral analysis models by a substantial margin.;Malcolm Sailor, Yale University, USA, education;Yale University;education;USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-6.4672236;-14.435476

Accurate beat tracking without DBN postprocessing;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_10.html;We propose a system for tracking beats and downbeats with two objectives: generality across a diverse music range, and high accuracy. We achieve generality by training on multiple datasets -- including solo instrument recordings, pieces with time signature changes, and classical music with high tempo variations -- and by removing the commonly used Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) postprocessing, which introduces constraints on the meter and tempo. For high accuracy, among other improvements, we develop a loss function tolerant to small time shifts of annotations, and an architecture alternating convolutions with transformers either over frequency or time. Our system surpasses the current state of the art in F1 score despite using no DBN. However, it can still fail, especially for difficult and underrepresented genres, and performs worse on continuity metrics, so we publish our model, code, and preprocessed datasets, and invite others to beat this.;"Francesco Foscarin, Johannes Kepler University, AUT, education;   Jan Schlüter, Johannes Kepler University, AUT, education;   Gerhard Widmer, Johannes Kepler University, AUT, education";Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University, Johannes Kepler University;education, education, education;AUT, AUT, AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;58.110508;7.192587

"Tomoyasu Nakano; Masataka Goto";Using Item Response Theory to Aggregate Music Annotation Results of Multiple Annotators;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_205.html;Human music annotation is one of the most important tasks in music information retrieval (MIR) research. Results of labeling, tagging, assessment, and evaluation can be used as training data for machine learning models that estimate them automatically. For such machine learning purposes, a single target (e.g., song) is usually annotated by multiple human annotators, and the results are aggregated by majority voting or averaging. Majority voting, however, requires the number of annotators to be an odd number, which is not always possible. And averaging is sensitive to differences in the judgmental characteristics of each annotator and cannot be used for ordinal scales. This paper therefore proposes that the item response theory (IRT) be used to aggregate the music annotation results of multiple annotators. IRT-based models can jointly estimate annotators' characteristics and latent scores (i.e., aggregations of annotation results) of the targets, and they are also applicable to ordinal scales. We evaluated the IRT-based models in two actual cases of music annotation --- semantic tagging of music and Likert scale-based evaluation of singing skill --- and compared those models with their simplified models that do not consider the characteristics of each annotator.;"Tomoyasu Nakano, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility;   Masataka Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), JPN, facility";National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST);facility, facility;JPN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;-21.064922;27.957241

These systems enable new approaches for classification and retrieval, leveraging both modalities. Despite the promising results they have shown for zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, closer inspection of the embeddings is needed. This paper evaluates the inherent zero-shot properties of joint audio-text spaces for the case-study of instrument recognition. We present an evaluation and analysis of two-tower systems for zero-shot instrument recognition, and a detailed analysis of the properties of the pre-projected and joint embedding spaces. Our findings suggest that audio encoders alone demonstrate good quality, while challenges remain within the text encoder or joint space projection. Specifically, two-tower systems exhibit sensitivity towards specific words, favoring generic prompts over musically informed ones. Despite the large size of textual encoders, they do not yet leverage additional textual context or infer instruments accurately from their descriptions. Lastly, a novel approach for quantifying the semantic meaningfulness of the textual space leveraging an existing instrument ontology is proposed.

Lyrics obtained from the listening histories of 541 Last.fm users, divided into At-Risk and No-Risk based on their mental well-being scores, were analyzed using natural language processing techniques. Statistical analyses of the results revealed that individuals at risk for depression prefer songs with lyrics associated with low valence and low arousal. Additionally, lyrics associated with themes of denial, self-reference, and ambivalence were preferred. In contrast, themes such as liberation, familiarity, and activity are not as favored.

To serialize symbolic music data, we design a custom tokenization stage based on compound tokens that carefully quantizes continuous values.  This technique preserves more score information while reducing sequence lengths by 3.5x compared to prior approaches. Using the transformer backbone, our method demonstrates better understanding of note values, rhythmic structure, and details such as staff assignment.

The proposed models yielded the best accuracy across experiments, with an average F1 weighted score of 0.8. This performance is, on average, 5% higher than out-of-domain and zero-shot models. When examining precision in binary classification, the proposed models perform on average 12% higher than the baselines.

Arthur Flexer;On the validity of employing ChatGPT for distant reading of music similarity;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_1.html;In this work we explore whether large language models (LLM) can be a useful and valid tool for music knowledge discovery. LLMs offer an interface to enormous quantities of text and hence can be seen as a new tool for 'distant reading', i.e. the computational analysis of text including sources about music. More specifically we investigated whether ratings of music similarity, as measured via human listening tests, can be recovered from textual data by using ChatGPT. We examined the inferences that can be drawn from these experiments through the formal lens of validity. We showed that correlation of ChatGPT with human raters is of of moderate positive size but also lower than the average human inter-rater agreement. By evaluating a number of threats to validity and conducting additional experiments with ChatGPT, we were able to show that especially construct validity of such an approach is seriously compromised. The opaque black box nature of ChatGPT makes it close to impossible to judge the experiment's construct validity, i.e. the relationship between what is meant to be inferred from the experiment, which are estimates of music similarity, and what is actually being measured. As a consequence the use of LLMs for music knowledge discovery cannot be recommended.;Arthur Flexer, Johannes Kepler University, AUT, education;Johannes Kepler University;education;AUT;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies;-16.558134;2.0641139
"Weixing Wei; Jiahao Zhao; Yulun Wu; Kazuyoshi Yoshii";Streaming Piano Transcription Based on Consistent Onset and Offset Decoding with Sustain Pedal Detection;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_18.html;This paper describes a streaming audio-to-MIDI piano transcription approach that aims to sequentially translate a music signal into a sequence of note onset and offset events. The sequence-to-sequence nature of this task may call for the computationally-intensive transformer model for better performance, which has recently been used for offline transcription benchmarks and could be extended for streaming transcription with causal attention mechanisms. We assume that the performance limitation of this naive approach lies in the decoder. Although time-frequency features useful for onset detection are considerably different from those for offset detection, the single decoder is trained to output a mixed sequence of onset and offset events without guarantee of the correspondence between the onset and offset events of the same note. To overcome this limitation, we propose a streaming encoder-decoder model that uses a convolutional encoder aggregating local acoustic features, followed by an autoregressive Transformer decoder detecting a variable number of onset events and another decoder detecting the offset events for the active pitches with validation of the sustain pedal at each time frame. Experiments using the MAESTRO dataset showed that the proposed streaming method performed comparably with or even better than the state-of-the-art offline methods while significantly reducing the computational cost.;"Weixing Wei, Kyoto University, JPN, education;   Jiahao Zhao, Kyoto University, JPN, education;   Yulun Wu, Fudan University, CHN, education;   Kazuyoshi Yoshii, Kyoto University, JPN, education";Kyoto University, Kyoto University, Fudan University, Kyoto University;education, education, education, education;JPN, JPN, CHN, JPN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developing economies, Developed economies;6.58561;-38.393475

Results on the 10KSinging dataset show that data augmentation and BiCA boost performance individually.

JASCO can generate high-quality music samples conditioned on global text descriptions along with fine-grained local controls. JASCO is based on the Flow Matching modeling paradigm together with a novel conditioning method that allows for both locally (e.g., chords) and globally (text description) controlled music generation. Specifically, we apply information bottleneck layers in conjunction with temporal blurring to extract relevant information with respect to specific controls. This al- lows the incorporation of both symbolic and audio-based conditions in the same text-to-music model. We experiment with various symbolic control signals (e.g., chords, melody), as well as with audio representations (e.g., separated drum tracks, full-mix).

Diffusion inference-time T-optimization (DITTO), in particular, offers state-of-the-art results, but is over 10x slower than real-time, limiting practical use. We propose Distilled Diffusion Inference-Time T-Optimization (or DITTO-2), a new method to speed up inference-time optimization-based control and unlock faster-than-real-time generation for a wide-variety of applications such as music inpainting, outpainting, intensity, melody, and musical structure control. Our method works by (1) distilling a pre-trained diffusion model for fast sampling via an efficient, modified consistency or consistency trajectory distillation process (2) performing inference-time optimization using our distilled model with one-step sampling as an efficient surrogate optimization task and (3) running a final multi-step sampling generation (decoding) using our estimated noise latents for best-quality, fast, controllable generation. Through thorough evaluation, we find our method not only speeds up generation over 10-20x, but simultaneously improves control adherence and generation quality all at once. Furthermore, we apply our approach to a new application of maximizing text adherence (CLAP score) and show we can convert an unconditional diffusion model without text inputs into a model that yields state-of-the-art text control.

One approach to tackle OMR is through a multi-stage pipeline, where the model first detects visual music notation elements in the image (object detection) and then assembles them into a music notation (notation assembly). In this paper, we focus on the MUSCIMA++ v2.0 dataset. It represents musical notation as a graph, where the pairwise relationships among detected music objects are predicted. Most previous work on notation assembly unrealistically assumes perfect object detection. In this study, we consider both stages together. First, we introduce a music object detector based on YOLOv8, which improves detection performance. Second, we introduce a supervised training pipeline that completes the notation assembly stage based on detection output. We find that this model is able to outperform existing models trained on perfect detection output, showing the benefit of considering the detection and assembly stage in a more holistic way.

Previous studies have shown that lyrics are a rich source of information and are complementary to other information sources, such as audio. One factor that hinders the research and application of lyrics on a large scale is their availability. To mitigate this, we propose the use of transcription-based lyrics embeddings (TLE). These estimate ground-truth' lyrics embeddings given only audio as input. Central to this approach is the use of transcripts derived from an automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) system instead of human-transcribed,ground-truth' lyrics, making them substantially more accessible. We conduct an experiment to assess the effectiveness of TLEs across various music information retrieval (MIR) tasks.

In this paper we also propose a Transformer-based framework for note-level transcription of choral music. This framework bypasses the frame-level processing and directly produces a sequence of notes with associated timestamps.

Of the very few current systems that support source separation beyond this setup, most continue to rely on an inflexible decoder setup that can only support a fixed pre-defined set of stems. Increasing stem support in these inflexible systems correspondingly requires increasing computational complexity, rendering extensions of these systems computationally infeasible for long-tail instruments. We propose Banquet, a system that allows source separation of multiple stems using just one decoder. A bandsplit source separation model is extended to work in a query-based setup in tandem with a music instrument recognition PaSST model. On the MoisesDB dataset, Banquet — at only 24.9 M trainable parameters — performed on par with or better than the significantly more complex 6-stem Hybrid Transformer Demucs. The query-based setup allows for the separation of narrow instrument classes such as clean acoustic guitars, and can be successfully applied to the extraction of less common stems such as reeds and organs.;"Karn N Watcharasupat, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, education;   Alexander Lerch, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, education";Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology;education, education;USA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;43.929314;-21.827032

To achieve this, a conversational music retrieval system should seamlessly engage in multi-turn conversation by 1) understanding user queries and 2) responding with natural language and retrieved music. A straightforward solution would be a data-driven approach utilizing such conversation logs. However, few datasets are available for the research and are limited in terms of volume and quality. In this paper, we present a data generation framework for rich music discovery dialogue using a large language model (LLM) and user intents, system actions, and musical attributes. This is done by i) dialogue intent analysis using grounded theory, ii) generating attribute sequences via cascading database filtering, and iii) generating utterances using large language models.

We collected EEG data alongside subjective ratings of arousal, valence, familiarity, and preference from both fans (N=20) and non-fans (N=34) of the K-pop idol group, NCT127 to investigate response variability to the same NCT127 music. Our analysis focused on determining whether the inclusion of EEG alongside audio features could enhance the predictive power of linear mixed-effects models for these subjective ratings. Specifically, we employed stimulus-response correlation (SRC), a recent approach in neuroscience correlating stimulus features with EEG responses to the ecologically valid stimuli. The results showed that familiarity and preference was significantly higher in the fan group. Furthermore, the inclusion of SRC significantly enhanced the prediction of familiarity compared to models based solely on audio features. However, the impact of SRC on predictions of arousal and valence exhibited variation depending on the correlated audio features, with certain SRCs improving predictions while others diminished them. For preference, only a few SRCs negatively affected model performance.

Existing approaches mainly employ supervised learning and the training demands strongly-aligned and paired song-to-piano data, which is built by remapping piano notes to song audio. This would, however, result in the loss of piano information and accordingly cause inconsistencies between the original and remapped piano versions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a transfer learning approach that pre-trains our model on piano-only data and fine-tunes it on weakly-aligned paired data constructed without note remapping. During pre-training, to guide the model to learn piano composition concepts instead of merely transcribing audio, we use an existing lead sheet transcription model as the encoder to extract high-level features from the piano recordings. The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on the paired song-piano data to transfer the learned composition knowledge to the pop song domain.

In this paper, we focus on generative modeling of singers' vocal melodies extracted from audio recordings, as the voice is musically prominent within the tradition. Prior generative work in Hindustani music models melodies as coarse discrete symbols which fails to capture the rich expressive melodic intricacies of singing.

We propose GaMaDHaNi, a modular two-level hierarchy, consisting of a generative model on pitch contours, and a pitch contour to audio synthesis model. We compare our approach to non-hierarchical audio models and hierarchical models that use a self-supervised intermediate representation, through a listening test and qualitative analysis. We also evaluate audio model's ability to faithfully represent the pitch contour input using Pearson correlation coefficient. By using pitch contours as an intermediate representation, we show that our model may be better equipped to listen and respond to musicians in a human-AI collaborative setting by highlighting two potential interaction use cases (1) primed generation, and (2) coarse pitch conditioning.;"Nithya Nadig Shikarpur, University of Montreal, CAN, education;   Krishna Maneesha Dendukuri, University of Montreal, CAN, education;   Yusong Wu, University of Montreal, CAN, education;   Antoine CAILLON, IRCAM, FRA, facility;   Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang, Google Brain, USA, company";University of Montreal, University of Montreal, University of Montreal, IRCAM, Google Brain;education, education, education, facility, company;CAN, CAN, CAN, FRA, USA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-15.747105;-14.603139
"Megan Wei; Michael Freeman; Chris Donahue; Chen Sun";Do Music Generation Models Encode Music Theory?;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_189.html;"Music foundation models possess impressive music generation capabilities. When people compose music, they may infuse their understanding of music into their work, by using notes and intervals to craft melodies, chords to build progressions, and tempo to create a rhythmic feel. To what extent is this true of music generation models? More specifically, are fundamental Western music theory concepts observable within the ""inner workings"" of these models? Recent work proposed leveraging latent audio representations from music generation models towards music information retrieval tasks (e.g. genre classification, emotion recognition), which suggests that high-level musical characteristics are encoded within these models. However, probing individual music theory concepts (e.g. tempo, pitch class, chord quality) remains under-explored. Thus, we introduce SynTheory, a synthetic MIDI and audio music theory dataset, consisting of tempos, time signatures, notes, intervals, scales, chords, and chord progressions concepts. We then propose a framework to probe for these music theory concepts in music foundation models (Jukebox and MusicGen) and assess how strongly they encode these concepts within their internal representations. Our findings suggest that music theory concepts are discernible within foundation models and that the degree to which they are detectable varies by model size and layer.";"Megan Wei, Brown University, USA, education;   Michael Freeman, Brown University, USA, education;   Chris Donahue, Carnegie Mellon University, USA, education;   Chen Sun, Brown University, USA, education";Brown University, Brown University, Carnegie Mellon University, Brown University;education, education, education, education;USA, USA, USA, USA;FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;3.8284578;-20.123302

Although there have been attempts to accelerate the iterative procedure, high-quality TTA systems remain inefficient due to the hundreds of iterations required in the inference phase and large amount of model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose SpecMaskGIT, a light-weight, efficient yet effective TTA model based on the masked generative modeling of spectrograms. First, SpecMaskGIT synthesizes a realistic 10 s audio clip in less than 16 iterations, an order of magnitude less than previous iterative TTA methods. As a discrete model, SpecMaskGIT outperforms larger VQ-Diffusion and auto-regressive models in a TTA benchmark, while being real-time with only 4 CPU cores or even 30× faster with a GPU. Next, built upon a latent space of Mel-spectrograms, SpecMaskGIT has a wider range of applications (e.g., zero-shot bandwidth extension) than similar methods built on latent wave domains. Moreover, we interpret SpecMaskGIT as a generative extension to previous discriminative audio masked Transformers, and shed light on its audio representation learning potential.

Identifying how exactly these models conceptualize data has become crucial. To date, however, interpretability research has mainly focused on the text and image domain, leaving a gap in the music domain. In this paper, we investigate the transferability of straightforward text-oriented interpretability techniques to the music domain. Specifically, we examine the usability of these techniques for analyzing how the generative music model MusicGen constructs representations of human-interpretable musicological concepts. Using the DecoderLens, we gain insight into how the model gradually composes these concepts, and using interchange interventions, we observe the contributions of individual model components in generating the sound of specific instruments and genres. We also encounter several shortcomings of the interpretability techniques for the music domain, which underscore the complexity of music and need for proper audio-oriented adaptation.

Historical records, including manuscripts, research papers, and oral traditions, confirm Saint Yared's establishment of three canonical EOTC chanting modes during the 6th century. This paper attempts to investigate the EOTC chants using music information retrieval (MIR) techniques. Among the research questions regarding the analysis and understanding of EOTC chants, Yaredawi YeZema Silt, namely the mode of chanting adhering to Saint Yared's standards, is of primary importance. Therefore, we consider the task of Yaredawi YeZema Silt classification in EOTC chants by introducing a new dataset and showcasing a series of classification experiments for this task. Results show that using the distribution of stabilized pitch contours as the feature representation on a simple neural-network-based classifier becomes an effective solution. The musicological implications and insights of such results are further discussed through a comparative study with the previous ethnomusicology literature on EOTC chants. By making this dataset publicly accessible, our aim is to promote future exploration and analysis of EOTC chants and highlight potential directions for further research, thereby fostering a deeper understanding and preservation of this unique spiritual and cultural heritage.;"Mequanent Argaw Muluneh, Academia Sinica, education;   Yan-Tsung Peng, National Chengchi University, TWN, education;   Li Su, Academia Sinica, TWN, education";Academia Sinica, National Chengchi University, Academia Sinica;education, education, education;TWN, TWN, TWN;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developing economies, Developing economies;-10.914233;-11.827948

Against this shortcoming, we present STONE, the first self-supervised tonality estimator. The architecture behind STONE, named ChromaNet, is a convnet with octave equivalence which outputs a ``key signature profile'' (KSP) of 12 structured logits. First, we train ChromaNet to regress artificial pitch transpositions between any two unlabeled musical excerpts from the same audio track, as measured as cross-power spectral density (CPSD) within the circle of fifths (CoF). We observe that this self-supervised pretext task leads KSP to correlate with tonal key signature. Based on this observation, we extend STONE to output a structured KSP of 24 logits, and introduce supervision so as to disambiguate major versus minor keys sharing the same key signature.

Analysis of TR-808 samples reveals their spectral characteristics and their integration into modern genres like trap and hip-hop. The study also considers the impact of loudspeaker frequency response and human ear sensitivity on bass drum perception. The findings suggest that Storch’s method prioritizes the spectral properties of the bass drum over traditional pitch values, enhancing bass response and overall sound quality.

Such models enable end-to-end generation of higher-quality music, and some allow conditioned generation using text descriptions. However, the control power of text controls on music is intrinsically limited, as they can only describe music \textit{indirectly} through meta-data (such as singers and instruments) or high-level representations (such as genre and emotion). \textit{We aim to further equip the models with direct and \textbf{content-based} controls on innate music languages} such as pitch, chords and drum track.

As the main contribution of this article, we introduce a novel evaluation approach that decomposes an audio track into musically meaningful sound events and applies the evaluation metric based on these units. In a case study, we apply this strategy to the challenging task of separating piano concerto recordings into piano and orchestra tracks. To assess piano separation quality, we use a score-informed nonnegative matrix factorization approach to decompose the reference and separated piano tracks into notewise sound events. In our experiments assessing various MSS systems, we demonstrate that our notewise evaluation, which takes into account factors such as pitch range and musical complexity, enhances the comprehension of both the results of source separation and the intricacies within the underlying music.;"Yigitcan Özer, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, education;   Hans-Ulrich Berendes, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, education;   Vlora Arifi-Müller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, education;   Fabian-Robert Stöter, AudioShake, USA, company;   Meinard Müller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, education";International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, AudioShake, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen;education, education, education, company, education;DEU, DEU, DEU, USA, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;38.825928;-24.455664

However, editing music audios remains challenging due to conflicting desiderata: performing fine-grained alterations on the audio while maintaining a simplistic user interface. To address this challenge, we propose Audio Prompt Adapter (or AP Adapter), a lightweight addition to pretrained text-to-music models. We utilize AudioMAE to extract features from the input audio, and construct attention-based adapters to feed these features into the internal layers of AudioLDM2, a diffusion text-to-music model. With only 22M trainable parameters, AP Adapter empowers users to harness both global (e.g., style and timbre) and local (e.g., melody) aspects of music, using the original audio and a short text as inputs. Through objective and subjective studies, we evaluate AP Adapter on three tasks: timbre transfer, style transfer, and accompaniment generation. Additionally, we demonstrate its effectiveness on out-of-domain audios containing unseen instruments during training.;"Fang Duo Tsai, National Taiwan University, TWN, education;   Shih-Lun Wu, Carnegie Mellon University, USA, education;   Haven Kim, University of California San Diego, USA, education;   Bo-Yu Chen, National Taiwan University, TWN, education;   Bo-Yu Chen, Rhythm Culture Corporation, TWN, company;   Hao-Chung Cheng, National Taiwan University, TWN, education;   Yi-Hsuan Yang, National Taiwan University, TWN, education";National Taiwan University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of California San Diego, National Taiwan University, Rhythm Culture Corporation, National Taiwan University, National Taiwan University;education, education, education, education, company, education, education;TWN, USA, USA, TWN, TWN, TWN, TWN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;-21.19826;-25.95996

Indeed, even though in the recent literature the quality of the generated transcription has improved thanks to the curation of large training datasets via crowdsourcing, there is still a large margin of improvement for this task to be considered solved. Aiming to steer the development of future models, we identify the most common errors from training and testing on the aforementioned crowdsourced datasets. We perform this study in three steps: First, we detail the quality of the transcription for each class of interest; second, we employ a new metric and a pseudo confusion matrix to quantify different mistakes in the estimations; last, we compute the agreement between different annotators of the same track to estimate the accuracy of the ground-truth. Our findings are twofold: On the one hand, we observe that the previously reported issue that less represented instruments (e.g., toms) are less reliably transcribed is mostly solved now. On the other hand, cymbal instruments have unprecedented relative low performance.

In this paper, we focus on the problem of compositional representation learning for music data, specifically targeting the fully-unsupervised setting. We propose a simple and extensible framework that leverages an explicit compositional inductive bias, defined by a flexible auto-encoding objective that can leverage any of the current state-of-art generative models.

Our findings reveal that our proposal achieves comparable or superior performance with respect to other blind source separation methods and, furthermore, it even surpasses current state-of-art supervised baselines on signal-to-interference ratio metrics. Additionally, by learning an a-posteriori masking diffusion model in the space of composable representations, we achieve a system capable of seamlessly performing unsupervised source separation, unconditional generation, and variation generation.

In this paper, a novel temporal convolutional network-based beat-tracking approach featuring self-supervised learning (SSL) representations and adapter tuning is proposed to track the beat and downbeat of singing voices jointly. The SSL DistilHuBERT representations are utilized to capture the semantic information of singing voices and are further fused with the generic spectral features to facilitate beat estimation. Sources of variabilities that are particularly prominent with the non-homogeneous singing voice data are reduced by the efficient adapter tuning. Extensive experiments show that feature fusion and adapter tuning improve the performance individually, and the combination of both leads to significantly better performances than the un-adapted baseline system, with up to 31.6% and 42.4% absolute F1-score improvements on beat and downbeat tracking, respectively.;"Jiajun Deng, Chinese University of Hong Kong, CHN, education;   Yaolong Ju, Huawei, CHN, company;   Jing Yang, Huawei, CHN, company;   Simon Lui, Huawei, CHN, company;   Xunying Liu, Chinese University of Hong Kong, CHN, education";Chinese University of Hong Kong, Huawei, Huawei, Huawei, Chinese University of Hong Kong;education, company, company, company, education;CHN, CHN, CHN, CHN, CHN;NOT_FOUND;Developing economies;Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies, Developing economies;57.744686;0.941973

However, existing systems for mixing style transfer are limited in that they often operate only on a fixed number of tracks, introduce artifacts, and produce mixes in an end-to-end fashion, without grounding in traditional audio effects, prohibiting interpretability and controllability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Diff-MST, a framework comprising a differentiable mixing console, a transformer controller, and an audio production style loss function. By inputting raw tracks and a reference song, our model estimates control parameters for audio effects within a differentiable mixing console, producing high-quality mixes and enabling post-hoc adjustments. Moreover, our architecture supports an arbitrary number of input tracks without source labelling, enabling real-world applications.

Addressing this gap, our work focuses on monotimbral MSS, specifically within the context of classical guitar duets. To this end, we introduce the GuitarDuets dataset, featuring a combined total of approximately 3 hours of real and synthesized classical guitar duet recordings, as well as note-level annotations of the synthesized duets. We perform an extensive cross-dataset evaluation by adapting Demucs, a state-of-the-art MSS architecture, to monotimbral source separation. Furthermore, we develop a joint permutation-invariant transcription and separation framework, to exploit note event predictions as auxiliary information. Our results indicate that utilizing both the real and synthesized subsets of GuitarDuets leads to improved separation performance in an independently recorded test set compared to existing multi-track guitar datasets.

In recent years, APT has relied on supervised deep learning, which demands a large amount of labeled data that is often limited. This paper introduces a semi-supervised approach to APT, leveraging unlabeled data with techniques originally introduced in computer vision (CV): pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization, and distribution matching. The idea of pseudo-labeling is to use the current model for producing artificial labels for unlabeled data, and consistency regularization makes the model's predictions for unlabeled data robust to augmentations. Finally, distribution matching ensures that the pseudo-labels follow the same marginal distribution as the reference labels, adding an extra layer of robustness. Our method, tested on three piano datasets, shows improvements over purely supervised methods and performs comparably to existing semi-supervised approaches. Conceptually, this work illustrates that semi-supervised learning techniques from CV can be effectively transferred to the music domain, considerably reducing the dependence on large annotated datasets.;"Sebastian Strahl, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, facility;   Meinard Müller, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, DEU, facility";International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen;facility, facility;DEU, DEU;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;6.1906385;-36.32899

We propose a novel method for controlling surprisal in music generation using sequence models. To achieve this goal, we define a metric called Instantaneous Information Content (IIC). The IIC serves as a proxy function for the perceived musical surprisal (as estimated from a probabilistic model) and can be calculated at any point within a music piece. This enables the comparison of surprisal across different musical content even if the musical events occur in irregular time intervals. We use beam search to generate musical material whose IIC curve closely approximates a given target IIC. We experimentally show that the IIC correlates with harmonic and rhythmic complexity and note density. The correlation decreases with the length of the musical context used for estimating the IIC.

Identifying repetitions in music is computationally not trivial, especially when they are varied or deeply hidden within tree-like structures. Rather than focusing on repetitions of musical events, we propose to pursue repeated structural relations between events. More specifically, given a context-free grammar that describes a tonal structure, we aim to computationally identify such relational repetitions within the derivation tree of the grammar. To this end, we first introduce the template, a grammar-generic structure for generating trees that contain structural repetitions. We then approach the discovery of structural repetitions as a search for optimally compressible templates that describe a corpus of pieces in the form of production-rule-labeled trees. To make it tractable, we develop a heuristic, inspired by tree compression algorithms, to approximate the optimally compressible templates of the corpus. After implementing the algorithm in Haskell, we apply it to a corpus of jazz harmony trees, where we assess its performance based on the compressibility of the resulting templates and the music-theoretical relevance of the identified repetitions.;"Zeng Ren, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, CHE, education;   Yannis Rammos, EPFL, CHE, education;   Martin A Rohrmeier, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, CHE, education";École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, EPFL, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne;education, education, education;CHE, CHE, CHE;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-36.16536;-28.435778

We establish a replicable methodology to systematically identify similar pieces of music audio in a manner that is useful for understanding training data attribution. We compare the effect of applying CLMR and CLAP embeddings to similarity measurement in a set of 5 million audio clips used to train VampNet, a recent open source generative music model. We validate this approach with a human listening study. We also explore the effect that modifications of an audio example (e.g., pitch shifting) have on similarity measurements. This work is foundational to incorporating automated influence attribution into generative modeling, which promises to let model creators and users move from ignorant appropriation to informed creation.

"Brian Bemman; Justin Christensen";Inner Metric Analysis as a Measure of Rhythmic Syncopation;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_251.html;Inner Metric Analysis (IMA) is a method for symbolic music analysis that identifies strong and weak metrical positions according to coinciding periodicities within note onsets. These periodicities are visualized with bar graphs known as metric weight and spectral weight profiles. Analyzing these profiles for the presence of syncopation has thus far required manual inspection. In this paper, we propose a simple measure using chi-squared distance for quantifying the level of syncopation found in IMA weight profiles by considering each as a distribution to be compared against (1) a uniform distribution 'nominal' weight profile, and (2) a non-uniform distribution based on beat strength. We apply this measure to the task of predicting perceptual ratings of syncopation using the Song (2014) dataset of 111 single-bar rhythmic patterns and compare its performance to seven existing models of syncopation/complexity. Our results indicate that the proposed measure based on (1) achieves a moderately high Spearman rank correlation (r_s=0.80) to all ratings and is the only single measure that reportedly works across all categories. For so-called polyrhythms in 4/4, the measure based on (2) surpasses all other models and further outperforms five models for monorhythms in 6/8 and three models for monorhythms in 4/4.;"Brian Bemman, Durham University, GBR, education;   Justin Christensen, The University of Sheffield, GBR, education";Durham University, The University of Sheffield;education, education;GBR, GBR;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies;39.688496;22.043358
"Antonin Gagneré; Slim Essid; Geoffroy Peeters";A Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning scheme for beat tracking amenable to few-shot learning;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_283.html;In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Supervised-Learning scheme to train rhythm analysis systems and instantiate it for few-shot beat tracking.   Taking inspiration from the Contrastive Predictive Coding paradigm, we propose to train a Log-Mel-Spectrogram-Transformer-encoder to contrast observations at times separated by hypothesized beat intervals from those that are not.   We do this without the knowledge of ground-truth tempo or beat positions, as we rely on the local maxima of a Predominant Local Pulse function, considered as a proxy for Tatum positions, to define candidate anchors, candidate positives (located at a distance of a power of two from the anchor) and negatives (remaining time positions).   We show that a model pre-trained using this approach on the unlabeled FMA, MTT and MTG-Jamendo datasets can successfully be fine-tuned in the few-shot regime, i.e. with just a few annotated examples to get a competitive beat-tracking performance.;"Antonin Gagneré, IRCAM, FRA, education;   Slim Essid, IRCAM, FRA, education;   Geoffroy Peeters, IRCAM, FRA, education";IRCAM, IRCAM, IRCAM;education, education, education;FRA, FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;58.037735;6.008933
"Christopher J. Tralie; Ben Cantil";A Bayesian Approach To Real Time Concatenative Musaicing;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_340.html;We present The Concatenator,'' a real time system for audio-guided concatenative synthesis. Similarly to Driedger et al.'smusaicing'' (or ``audio mosaicing'') technique, we concatenate a set number of windows within a corpus of audio to re-create the harmonic and percussive aspects of a target audio stream. Unlike Driedger's NMF-based technique, however, we instead use an explicitly Bayesian point of view, where corpus window indices are hidden states and the target audio stream is an observation. We use a particle filter to infer the best hidden corpus states in real-time. Our transition model includes a tunable parameter to control the time-continuity of corpus grains, and our observation model allows users to prioritize how quickly windows change to match the target. Because the computational complexity of the system is independent of the corpus size, our system scales to corpora that are hours long, which is an important feature in the age of vast audio data collections. Within The Concatenator module itself, composers can vary grain length, fit to target, and pitch shift in real time while reacting to the sounds they hear, enabling them to rapidly iterate ideas. To conclude our work, we evaluate our system with extensive quantitative tests of the effects of parameters, as well as a qualitative evaluation with artistic insights. Based on the quality of the results, we believe the real-time capability unlocks new avenues for musical expression and control, suitable for live performance and modular synthesis integration, which furthermore represents an essential breakthrough in concatenative synthesis technology.;"Christopher J.

"Dorian Desblancs; Gabriel Meseguer Brocal; Romain Hennequin; Manuel Moussallam";From Real to Cloned Singer Identification;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_271.html;Cloned voices of popular singers sound increasingly realistic and have gained popularity over the past few years. They however pose a threat to the industry due to personality rights concerns. As such, methods to identify the original singer in synthetic voices are needed. In this paper, we investigate how singer identification methods could be used for such a task. We present three embedding models that are trained using a singer-level contrastive learning scheme, where positive pairs consist of segments with vocals from the same singers. These segments can be mixtures for the first model, vocals for the second, and both for the third. We demonstrate that all three models are highly capable of identifying real singers. However, their performance deteriorates when classifying cloned versions of singers in our evaluation set. This is especially true for models that use mixtures as an input. These findings highlight the need to understand the biases that exist within singer identification systems, and how they can influence the identification of voice deepfakes in music.;"Dorian Desblancs, Deezer, FRA, company;   Gabriel Meseguer Brocal, Deezer, FRA, company;   Romain Hennequin, Deezer, FRA, company;   Manuel Moussallam, Deezer, FRA, company";Deezer, Deezer, Deezer, Deezer;company, company, company, company;FRA, FRA, FRA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;30.763947;4.1550794

Moreover, current systems frequently rely solely on text input and typically focus on producing complete musical pieces, which is incompatible with existing workflows in music production. To address these issues, we introduce Diff-A-Riff, a Latent Diffusion Model designed to generate high-quality instrumental accompaniments adaptable to any musical context. This model offers control through either audio references, text prompts, or both, and produces 48kHz pseudo-stereo audio while significantly reducing inference time and memory usage. We demonstrate the model's capabilities through objective metrics and subjective listening tests, with extensive examples available on the accompanying website.;"Javier Nistal, Sony CSL, JPN, company;   Marco Pasini, Queen Mary University of London, GBR, education;   Cyran Aouameur, Sony CSL, JPN, company;   Stefan Lattner, Sony CSL, FRA, company;   Maarten Grachten, Machine Learning Consultant, unknown, unknown";Sony CSL, Queen Mary University of London, Sony CSL, Sony CSL, Machine Learning Consultant;company, education, company, company, unknown;JPN, GBR, JPN, FRA, unknown;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;-6.5091586;-24.17748
"Morgan Buisson; Brian McFee; Slim Essid";Using Pairwise Link Prediction and Graph Attention Networks for Music Structure Analysis;2024;https://ismir2024program.ismir.net/poster_405.html;The task of music structure analysis has been mostly addressed as a sequential problem, by relying on the internal homogeneity of musical sections or their repetitions. In this work, we instead regard it as a pairwise link prediction task. If for any pair of time instants in a track, one can successfully predict whether they belong to the same structural entity or not, then the underlying structure can be easily recovered. Building upon this assumption, we propose a method that first learns to classify pairwise links between time frames as belonging to the same section (or segment) or not. The resulting link features, along with node-specific information, are combined through a graph attention network. The latter is regularized with a graph partitioning training objective and outputs boundary locations between musical segments and section labels. The overall system is lightweight and performs competitively with previous methods. The evaluation is done on two standard datasets for music structure analysis and an ablation study is conducted in order to gain insight on the role played by its different components.;"Morgan Buisson, IRCAM, FRA, education;   Brian McFee, New York University, USA, education;   Slim Essid, IRCAM, FRA, education";IRCAM, New York University, IRCAM;education, education, education;FRA, USA, FRA;NOT_FOUND;Developed economies;Developed economies, Developed economies, Developed economies;2.8977394;5.495033
