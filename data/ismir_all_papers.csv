Uitdenbogerd+RMIT University>AUS>education;Justin Zobel+RMIT University>AUS>education,"Several techniques have been proposed for matching melody queries to stored music. In previous work [2], we found that local alignment, a technique derived from bioinformatics, was more effective than the n-gram methods derived from information retrieval that are used in other work. In this paper we explore a broader range of n-gram techniques, and test them with both manual queries and queries automatically extracted from MIDI files. Our experiments show that alternative - indeed, simpler - n-gram matching techniques than those tested in earlier work can be as effective as local alignment; one highly effective technique is to simply count the number of 5-grams in common between query and stored piece of music. N-grams are particularly effective for short queries and manual queries, while local alignment is superior for the automatic queries. In our experiments we have used a database of 10 466 standard MIDI files down loaded from the internet. These were processed to extract their melodies as described in [1]. In that earlier paper, we used volunteer listeners to judge a small set of extracted melodies. We discovered that our simple algorithm that chooses notes starting at each instance to be melody notes and that we have named all mono, was the most successful in extracting melodies. However, we continued to test all of our melody extraction algorithms in our second paper [2] in the context of melodic similarity measurement. In this experiment we used three methods of melodic standardisation to produce the representations that would be used for matching. They were: contour, which uses a three-symbol alphabet to represent where a melody goes up, down or stays the same; modulo-12 interval (pitch distance between notes), which keeps the size of intervals and their direction but reduced to one octave; and exact interval, which keeps the exact interval size and direction. All these represented pitch information only. A set of 28 automatically extracted melody queries were used to locate other versions of the same piece of music. The results were evaluated by computing the eleven-point precision average and the precision at a recall level of 20. Again the all mono method was successful, as were the entropy channel and all channels methods. The entropy channel method applies the all mono technique to each channel and then selects the melody channel based on its first order predictive entropy. The all channels technique also applies the all mono algorithm to each channel and then retains them all for the matching process. In addition, we confirmed that contour was insufficient for good matching, but that the use of interval sequences worked well. Queries of 30 intervals produced good answers. The similarity measurement techniques tested were local alignment, longest common subsequence, an n-gram counting technique that included the frequency of occurrence of each n-gram, and the Ukkonen n-gram measure. Local alignment was a clear winner. However, local alignment is a slow technique. It would be useful to have a good n-gram-based technique as indexes can be built to speed up matches. This led to our current exploration of n-grams. In this current set of experiments we used the same experimental framework as that used in [2], but also tested a set of manually produced queries. These manual queries were created by a classically trained pianist with perfect pitch, who listened to the source MI DI files and played a melodic fragment to represent each piece. We explored the variables of n-gram length, n-gram counting method, song-length normalisation, melody extraction and query length. The results clearly showed that n-grams of length five work best using the count distinct method, where term",AUS,education,Developed economies,"[-21.950747, 12.021705]","[10.458278, 25.674925]","[-9.966851, 13.527035, 1.5142258]","[12.146098, 8.528841, -11.015212]","[13.550116, 9.195553]","[5.964702, 3.0088642]","[16.559679, 7.5599427, -0.71927035]","[6.199837, 9.134612, 15.462156]"

Uitdenbogerd+RMIT University>AUS>education;Abhijit Chattaraj+RMIT University>AUS>education;Justin Zobel+RMIT University>AUS>education,"Music Information Retrieval has a longer history than most people realise, with systems developed in the 1960's. The field has its roots in information retrieval, musicology and music psychology. Information retrieval has provided us with a framework for evaluating retrieval systems. Musicologists have applied various techniques to measure stylistic parameters of composers and general similarity of musical works. Music perception research has taught us that contour is the most important feature of melody for listeners (Dowling 1978). Precursors to computerised music IR are the incipit and theme indexes such as Barlow and Morganstern's dictionary of musical themes (Barlow and Morganstern 1948), however, on-line collections with incipit indexes were soon to follow (for example Hudson 1970). The current trend in music IR research has been to develop systems that allow the location of answers to queries presented as hummed melodies, or entered in some other way. The earliest system we have found was that developed by Yamamoto in 1988, which only allowed exact matches (Kageyama et al 1993). The nineties have shown a rapid increase in music IR research, with systems papers being published every year since 1993 and more than a dozen published in 1998 (eg. Uitdenbogerd and Zobel 1998, Blackburn and de Roure1998, Hewlett and Selfridge-Field 1998). In addition, interesting developments have occurred in the field of audio retrieval. Despite this growth of interest in the field, the comparison of systems is difficult because of the lack of a common data set, queries, or relevance judgements. MIR systems can be evaluated in a similar manner to other systems. As with traditional IR, we need to decide what is a query, what is an answer, and what is meant by relevance, that is, what constitutes similarity. The usual definition of an ad hoc music query is a melody fragment consisting of a sequence of notes. The relevance of answers produced by a system will depend on the user's need. For example, relevant answers for a search for copyright similarity may be different to those for a user who half remembers a song. In earlier work, we collected queries and relevance judgements from a collection of 10,466 MIDI files by assuming that alternative arrangements or performances of a piece chosen as a query were relevant, and used these to measure effectiveness with the standard techniques of eleven-point precision averages and precision at k pieces retrieved. These were used to determine which matching techniques were most successful. Whether these relevance judgements correspond to - or yield the same ranking of techniques as - human relevance judgements was an open question. In recent work, we collected manual queries by having an expert musician listen to MIDI files and create a melodic query for each file. The files were selected so as to allow comparison with our earlier work with automatic queries and relevance assessments. We also developed a system for collecting music relevance judgements from listeners to permit a more established approach to system evaluation. Users were presented with a MIDI file melody and were required to determine whether each answer was highly similar or not.",AUS,education,Developed economies,"[-20.716003, 30.305164]","[17.662737, 10.013004]","[-11.435485, 24.773275, 5.4172716]","[13.914063, 9.573709, -3.0776358]","[14.101717, 8.372066]","[6.426471, 3.6530826]","[16.616594, 6.6033583, -0.9244419]","[6.7389307, 9.141099, 14.920794]"

I describe a theory of musical meaning that argues that experienced listeners of tonal music hear musical motion metaphorically, as purposeful action within a dynamic field of musical forces (musical gravity, magnetism, and inertia). That theory has been used to clarify issues in Schenkerian theory, to analyze music in many styles, to improve the training of musicians, to account for experimental results in melodic expectation, to explain striking regularities in published analyses of tonal music, and even to illuminate the phenomenon of ""swing"" in jazz.     The assumptions of that theory generate a small set of patterns and pattern combinations. This small set of patterns crops up over and over again in tonal music. Recognizing these patterns and their significance requires seeing how they are embellished in particular pieces. I illustrate these patterns, their combinations and embellishments, and something about their meaning by analyzing several folk songs, including ""Ah, vous dirai-je, Maman"" and Mozart's variations on it.     The ubiquity of this small set of patterns raises interesting questions about searching for musical patterns, about the role of computers in information retrieval vs their role in musical artificial intelligence, and about musical meaning.

Kim+MIT Media Lab>USA>education;Wei Chai+MIT Media Lab>USA>education;Ricardo Garcia+MIT Media Lab>USA>education;Barry Vercoe+MIT Media Lab>USA>education,"Identifying a musical work from a melodic fragment is a task that most people are able to accomplish with relative ease. For some time now researchers have worked to give computers this ability as well, as it would be the cornerstone of any query-by-humming system. To accomplish this, it is reasonable to study how humans are able to perform this task, and to assess what features we use to determine melodic similarity. Research has shown that melodic contour is an important feature in determining melodic similarity, but it is also clear that rhythmic information is important as well. The goal of this research is to explore what variation of contour and rhythmic information can result in the most efficient, robust, and scalable representation for melody. We intend for this to be the basis of a query-by-humming system that will be used to test the validity of our proposed representation. The importance of melodic contour The literature suggests that a coarse melodic contour description is more important to listeners than strict intervals in determining melodic similarity. Experiments have shown that interval direction alone (i.e. the 3-level +/-/0 contour representation) is an important element of melody recognition. There is, of course, anecdotal and experimental evidence that humans use more than just interval direction (a 3-level contour) in assessing melodic similarity. In an experiment by Lindsay (1996), subjects were asked to repeat (sing) a melody that was played for them. He found that while there was some correlation between sung interval accuracy and musical experience, even musically inexperienced subjects were able to negotiate different interval sizes fairly successfully. From a practical standpoint, a 3-level representation will generally require longer queries to arrive at a unique match. Given the perceptual and practical considerations, we chose to explore finer (5- and 7-level) contour divisions for our representation. Proposed melody representation We used a triple <T P B> to represent each melody, where T is the time signature of the song, P is the pitch contour vector, and B is the beat number vector. The range of values of P vary depending on the number of levels of contour used, but follow the pattern of 0, +, -, ++, --, +++, etc. The first value of B is the location of the first note within its measure in beats (according to the time signature). Successive values of B are incremented according to the number of beats between successive notes. Values of B are quantized to the nearest whole beat. Additionally, we used a vector Q to represent different contour resolutions and quantization boundaries. The length of Q indirectly reveals the number of levels of contour being used, and the individual values of Q indicate the absolute value of the quantization boundaries (in number of half-steps). For example, Q = [0 1] represents that we quantize interval changes into three levels, 0 for no change, + for an ascending interval (a boundary at one half-step or more), and - for a descending interval. This representation is equivalent to the popular +/-/0 or U/D/R (up/down/repeat) representation. Q = [0 1 3] represents a quantization of intervals into five levels, 0 for no change, + for an ascending half-step or whole-step (1 or 2 half-steps), ++ for ascending at least a minor third (3 or more half-steps), - for a descending half-step or whole-step, and -- for a descent of at least a minor third. Thus far, we have assembled a data set of 50 multi-track MIDI files, containing a mixture of popular and classical music. The popular music selections span a variety of different countries.

The method uses the tonality measure which is derived from the discrete bark spectrum as a means of detecting transitions between tonal and noise-like parts of the audio input. The meaning of ‘tonal’ in this context is different from the music-theoretical meaning and implies that there are dominant sinusoidal components in the spectrum, but, does not indicate that they are consonant or harmonic in any sense. Segmentation is performed by determining the times of these transitions, hence providing reference points for search purposes. Search is carried out by pivoting the query information on these reference points. The cumulative distance between the tonality pattern in successive frames of the query and the candidate sound fragments is used as a measure of similarity. In order to quantify the tonality, the input is processed as follows: the signal is sampled at 22050 Hz and a 2048-point FFT is performed on each frame using a Hanning analysis window. The window is hopped every 71 msecs. which corresponds to approximately 30 % overlap with the previous window. A pre-emphasis filter is applied to compensate for the reduced sensitivity of the human ear at low frequencies. The bark-band filter outputs are calculated from the FFT output by integration of the power spectral density within the critical bands. This is followed by a stage in which tonality determination is carried out for each critical band. The Spectral Flatness Measure (SFM) and the corresponding tonality coefficient (Johnston 1988) are used to quantify the tonal quality, i.e. how much tone-like the sound is as opposed to being noise-like. SFM is defined by the ratio of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean of the power spectral density components in each critical band. A tonality vector is defined to be the collection of tonality coefficients for a single frame. More specifically, the tonality vector contains a tonality coefficient for each critical band. In order to perform segmentation, the tonal-to-noise and the noise-to-tonal transitions are obtained. These transitions are calculated, as a sequence bj (j is the time index), from the rate of change of the smoothed tonality vector with respect to time. The smoothing occurs due to averaging of the tonality vectors across several frames. By detecting rapid changes in the summary tonality in either direction, segmentation decisions are made. The sequence bj is an indicator for the overall tonal quality change of the input signal. Whenever tonal inputs become dominant in the input signal, for example, with the start of a vocal or solo instrument, the value of the indicator increases during the transition. That is to say, an increase in the value of b (over time) is interpreted as a transition from a noisy part to a more tonal part. Conversely, the decrease in the value of b, possibly extending to the negative extreme, indicates a transition from tonal to noisy spectra. The search for an audio fragment is done by comparing a short sequence of tonality vectors in the database with the same number of tonality vectors in the search sequence. As an exhaustive search is very costly for this purpose, a selective search that uses segments corresponding to relatively high perceptual entropy is performed. The determination of these segments is performed by the use of the b sequence. The starting times of these segments are called anchor times and are classified as either ‘tonal-to-noise’, or, ‘noise-to-tonal’. The noise-to-tonal anchor",USA,education,Developed economies,"[7.7985225, 26.515894]","[-15.355779, 4.570103]","[13.656799, 0.9329799, -5.064901]","[-1.0305611, 3.4738157, -13.585661]","[12.056409, 8.590465]","[5.4296637, 6.0619354]","[15.276759, 8.145539, -2.1999297]","[5.299334, 10.792669, 14.313591]"

14,Michael Good,Representing Music Using XML.,2000,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415032,Michael Good+Recordare>USA>company,"Why does the world need another music representation language? Beyond MIDI describes over 20 different languages or musical codes (Selfridge-Field, 1997). Most commercial music programs have their own internal, proprietary music representation and file format. Music's complexity has led to this proliferation of languages and formats. Sequencers, notation programs, analysis tools, and retrieval tools all need musical information optimized in different ways.  Yet no music interchange language has been widely adopted since MIDI. MIDI has contributed to enormous growth in the electronic music industry, but has many well-known limitations for notation, analysis, and retrieval. These include its lack of representation of musical concepts such as rests and enharmonic pitches (distinguishing Db from C#), as well as notation concepts such as stem direction and beaming. Other interchange formats such as NIFF and SMDL overcome these restrictions, but have not been widely adopted.  Successful interchange formats such as MIDI and HTML share a common trait that NIFF and SMDL lack. MIDI and HTML skillfully balance simplicity and power. They are simple enough for many people to learn, and powerful enough for many real-world applications. The simplicity makes it easy for software developers to implement the standards and to develop encoding tools for musicians. This helps circumvent the “chicken-and-egg” problem with new formats.  XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation for representing structured data in text, designed for ease of usage over the Internet by a wide variety of applications. XML is a meta-markup language that lets designers and communities develop their own representation languages for different applications. Like HTML and MIDI, it balances simplicity and power in a way that has made it very attractive to software developers.  The common base of XML technology lets developers of new languages focus on representation issues instead of low-level software development. All XML-based languages can be processed by a variety of XML tools available from multiple vendors. Since XML files are text files, users of XML files always have generic text-based tools available as a lowest common denominator. XML documents are represented in Unicode, providing support for international score exchange.  MusicXML is an XML-based music interchange language. It represents common western musical notation from the 17th century onwards, including both classical and popular music. The language is designed to be extensible to future coverage of early music and less standard 20th and 21st century scores. Non-western musical notations would use a separate XML language. As an interchange language, it is designed to be sufficient, not optimal, for diverse musical applications. MusicXML is not intended to supersede other languages that are optimized for specific musical applications, but to support sharing of musical data between applications.  The current MusicXML software runs on Windows. As of September 2000, it reads 100% of the MuseData format plus portions of NIFF and Finale’s Enigma Transportable Files (ETF). It writes to Standard MIDI Files in Format 1, MuseData files, and Sibelius. The NIFF, ETF, and MIDI converters use XML versions of these languages as intermediate structures. MusicXML is defined using an XML Document Type Definition (DTD) at www.musicxml.com/xml.html.

Dunn+Indiana University>USA>education,"This presentation will focus primarily on work being done at Indiana University in the area of digital music libraries, with some discussion of related efforts.  Indiana University’s VARIATIONS system serves as both an early example of a working digital library supporting music content and an early application of World Wide Web technologies to music. Since April 1996, the system has provided online access within the William and Gayle Cook Music Library to sound recordings from the library’s collections. Unlike many early university-based digital library projects whose primary goals were to provide broader access to unique and/or archival collections, VARIATIONS has built its digital collection from standard musical repertoire identified as central to the teaching mission of the Indiana University School of Music.  At present, the collection available in VARIATIONS encompasses over 6800 sound recording titles, representing a broad range of musical material reflecting the curriculum of the IU School of Music, including operas, songs, instrumental music, jazz, rock, and world music. Recordings are digitized at CD-quality by library staff and stored as both WAV-format “archival” copies and MPEG service copies for delivery to users. Users are able to locate sound recordings either by browsing reserve lists (organized by course number, instructor, composer, and title) or by searching IU’s online library catalog system, IUCAT. Sound files are streamed to users via an IBM VideoCharger server and a customized player application.  VARIATIONS has become an integral part of music library services and the instructional process within the School of Music at IU, but despite its success, VARIATIONS lacks many elements that one might expect to find in a “digital music library.” One such element is access to formats other than audio. In fact, the very name VARIATIONS was intended in part to convey the idea that musical information by its nature comes in many different formats (including sound, notation, time-based information, text, video) and that access to all of these formats in an integrated fashion is a desirable goal for a digital music library system.  Indiana University has recently embarked on a four-year project to dramatically expand upon the current VARIATIONS system to create a Digital Music Library with funding from the National Science Foundation and National Endowment for the Humanities as part of the federal Digital Library Initiatives – Phase 2 (DLI2) program. Lead Principal Investigator for the project is Dr. Michael A. McRobbie, Vice President for Information Technology and Professor of Philosophy and Computer Science at IU. This project, involving faculty from music, law, and library and information science, and librarians and staff from both the library system and information technology services department, centers around three main tasks: First, the project will create a Digital Music Library (DML) testbed system. Secondly, applications will be developed for music education and research based upon the collections and functionality provided by the DML testbed.

Pinzon+King's College London>GBR>education|Curtin University of Technology>AUS>education,"This paper focuses on a set of string pattern-matching problems that arise in musical analysis, and especially in musical information retrieval. A musical score can be viewed as a string: at a very rudimentary level, the alphabet could simply be the set of notes in the chromatic or diatonic notation, or the set of intervals that appear between notes (e.g. pitch may be represented as MIDI numbers and pitch intervals as number of semitones). An important example of flexibility required in score searching arises from the nature of polyphonic music. Within a certain time span each of the simultaneously-performed voices in a musical composition does not, typically, contain the same number of notes. So ‘melodic events’ occurring in one voice may be separated from their neighbours in a score by intervening events in other voices. Since we cannot generally rely on voice information being present in the score we need to allow for temporal ‘gaps’ between events in the matched pattern. Typically, the magnitude of such a gap (which might be expressed as a maximum time value, or, more probably, as a maximum number of skipped event-time-slots) will be a parameter set by the user. In our mathematical treatment the allowance for gaps in the query and the score being searched is represented by the constant α. Fig. 1 shows a short example from a musical score in monophonic format in which we attempt to match a pattern y (also known as the ‘query’) within a music score t (that we will call the ‘text’). This pattern can only be matched by allowing gaps of up to two spaces between pitches in the pattern; Note that the matching of the pattern to the score can be actually ‘approximate’ (see Cambouropolos et al 1999), in that the difference between the pitches and the sequence of musical events could be bounded by a constant δ (for simplicity we set δ to be zero in this example). We can see that there is an occurrence of the pattern in the text, starting at position three because y1, y2, y3, y4 and y5 matches exactly x3, x5, x8, x9 and x11, respectively, with a sequence of gaps G=(g1=1, g2=2, g3=0, g4=1). g1 is the number of spaces between the first two matched pitches in the text (i.e. between (x3=8) and (x5=3)), g2 is the number of spaces between the second and the third matched pitches in the text, and so on. Clearly, this is a valid match because all the gaps are less than or equal to two, which was the given gap restriction. If we want to find matches with a gap of up to one, then this match won’t be a valid one. Fig. 2 shows a similar example but for δ=1 so that the matched pitches don’t need to be exact, an ‘error’ of up to 1 is now allowed. Therefore, the first pitch in the pattern (8) matches the third pitch in the text (7) because |8-7|=1 and that is less or equal to our allowed error of one. The second pitch in the pattern (3) matches the fifth pitch in the text (4) and so on. The sequence of gaps remains exactly the same. The problem of matching with gaps can be formally defined as follows: given a musical sequence x (call the ‘text’) and a motif y (call the ‘pattern’) find all occurrences of y in x such that yi = xji ∀ i ∈ {1..m}, where m is the length of y. Note that y occurs at position j1 of x with a gap sequence G=(g1, g2, …, gm-1), where gi =|ji - ji+1-1| ∀ i ∈ {1..m-1}. We will consider this problem under a variety of conditions: the motif matching can be either exact or approximate. The gaps can be bounded, unbounded or all the same length. We have designed efficient algorithms and implementations of all the above variants.",FRA,education,Developed economies,"[12.408132, 8.233631]","[4.8844476, 22.101044]","[3.1805437, -4.361238, 12.461729]","[7.1648836, 8.401042, -12.309202]","[11.083781, 7.950862]","[5.247854, 3.2788951]","[14.104313, 7.497063, -0.5923619]","[5.608079, 9.571529, 15.30644]"

For a survey of several computational tasks related to this kind of data retrieval we refer to Crawford et al. [3]. Existing DMLs like MELDEX [1], Themefinder [4], and the Sonoda-Muraoka-System [7] work with melody databases relying on score-like information. Retrieval and matching are performed in a fault-tolerant way by string-based methods which mainly take into account pitch information. Generally, rhythm plays only a subordinate role. The music dictionary of Barlow and Morgenstern [2] shows that music retrieval based on pitch information only leads to results with typically too many false matches. (An example of such absurd matches is given in Selfridge-Field [6], p. 27.) We are convinced that both pitch and rhythm are crucial for recognizing melodies. In the more general context of polyphonic music, one is even forced to consider pitch and rhythm information. PROMS, a web-based computer-music service under development at the University of Bonn, Germany, is part of the MiDiLiB project [5]. The aim of PROMS is to design and to implement PROcedures for Music Search. Our discussion will take place in a rather general setting: we assume that our database contains several kinds of music such as polyphonic and homophonic music as well as melodies. We also use score-like information. A query to the database is a fragment of a piece of music. This could be a melody or a certain figure of an accompaniment. The task is now to locate efficiently all occurrences of this fragment in all pieces of music in the database. We have designed and implemented a web-based computer-music service that enables searching in polyphonic music. In contrast to the above mentioned systems, PROMS is not string-based but set-oriented. The basic objects within the PROMS system are single notes, specified by its onset time t, its pitch p, and its duration d. A piece of music is then a finite set M of notes. Our database consists of a sequence of N pieces of music in the MIDI format: D1, . . . , DN. Similarly, a query is itself a finite set Q of notes. Thus there is no principal difference between a piece Di of music in the database and a query Q. However, typically, Di is much larger than Q.

We treat the rhythm, melody, and chords of a music object as music features and develop various data structures and algorithms to efficiently perform approximate and partial matching for the retrieval of music data. In we present the techniques for retrieving songs by music segments. A music segment consists of a segment type and the associated beat and pitch information. We also propose multi-feature index structures for exact and approximate searching on different features. The problem of feature extraction is also studied. The repeating pattern is defined as a sequence of notes, which appears more than once in music objects. Choosing repeating patterns as the feature to represent the music objects meets both efficiency and semantic-richness requirements for content-based music data retrieval. We propose approaches to efficiently discover the repeating patterns of music objects. We have also implemented Muse, a prototype system for content-based music data retrieval to illustrate the feasibility of the concepts we propose.""",TWN,education,Developing economies,"[-12.724873, 22.052015]","[10.538237, 19.710644]","[-0.62816024, 17.426704, -0.22751713]","[9.629357, 1.5535078, -6.1319065]","[13.208245, 7.9359674]","[5.9757833, 3.7471533]","[16.027681, 6.860994, -1.8812171]","[6.313964, 9.449343, 14.98763]"

There has been some research to improve the interface either for pull applications, e.g. query-by-humming systems, or for push applications, e.g. collaborative-filtering-based or feature-based music recommendation systems. However, for content-based search or feature-based filtering systems, one important problem is to describe music by its parameters or features, so that search engines or information filtering agents can use them to measure the similarity of the target (user’s query or preference) and the candidates. MPEG7 (formally called “Multimedia Content Description Interface”) is an international standard, which describes the multimedia content data to allow universal indexing, retrieval, filtering, control, and other activities supported by rich metadata. However, the metadata about the multimedia content itself are still insufficient, because many features of multimedia content are quite perceptual and user-dependent. For example, emotional features are very important for multimedia retrieval, but they are hard to be described by a universal model since different users may have different emotional responses to the same multimedia content. We therefore turn to user modeling techniques and representations to describe the properties of each user, so that the retrieval will be more accurate. Besides, user modeling can be used to reduce the search space, make push service easier and improve the user interface. There are several important issues in user modeling for music information retrieval purpose or even more general multimedia retrieval. 1) How to model the user? User-programmed, machine-learning and knowledge-engineered methods can be used. 2) What information is needed to describe a user for music IR purpose? It may include both the user’s indirect information (e.g. age, sex, citizenship, education, music experience, etc.) and direct information (e.g. user’s interests, definition of qualitative features, appreciation habit, etc.). 3) How to represent, use and share the user model? Similar to MPEG7 concepts, we can use a standard language in text format to represent the user model, so that search engines or information filtering agents can use it to refine the result easily and efficiently, without repeating the long-time observation and learning of the user’s behavior. User modeling can be done on client-side or server-side. Issues including easy/hard to obtain the user information, hard/easy to use collaborative filtering model, far from/close to the music data, more/less privacy or safety, more scalable/higher load on the server, etc., need to be considered when choosing either of the paradigms. We adopted the client-side user modeling paradigm in our MusicCat system. It is an agent that allows the user to define contexts and corresponding features of music that he wants to hear in those contexts correspondingly. Besides, the user can also define qualitative features of music based on quantitative features. For examples, the user just needs to tell the agent what kind of music he prefers to hear at what kind of context, like “I need fast and exciting music when I’m happy”, “I need soft music to wake me up every morning at 8:00”, “I need slow classical music, when I’m thinking”, “I need rhythmic music when I’m walking”, etc. Or, the user can define qualitative features, like “Romantic music for me means slow music with titles or lyric including word love”, “My favorite music includes É” etc. Then, when the moment comes - the user tells the agent or a pre-defined time approaches, the agent can automatically, randomly and repeatedly choose music from the user’s collection according to the pre-defined constraints. So far, MusicCat uses a profile-based user interface. And only midi files are used in the system.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-18.077328, 19.564547]","[30.96459, 11.948953]","[-7.258646, 17.148188, -3.896642]","[16.314753, -1.073819, -0.008341399]","[14.080564, 8.371347]","[7.413214, 3.6498196]","[16.773987, 6.822271, -1.3929713]","[7.274197, 8.611003, 14.682829]"

1,Eloi Batlle;Pedro Cano,Automatic Segmentation for Music Classification using Competitive Hidden Markov Models.,2000,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416764,Eloi Batlle+Audiovisual Institute. Universitat Pompeu Fabra>ESP>education;Pedro Cano+Audiovisual Institute. Universitat Pompeu Fabra>ESP>education,"Music information retrieval has become a major topic in the last few years and we can find a wide range of applications that use it. For this reason, audio databases start growing in size as more and more digital audio resources have become available. However, the usefulness of an audio database relies not only on its size but also on its organization and structure. Therefore, much effort must be spent in the labeling process whose complexity grows with database size and diversity.  In this paper we introduce a new audio classification tool and we use its properties to develop an automatic system to segment audio material in a fully unsupervised way. The audio segments obtained with this process are automatically labeled in a way that two segments with similar psychoacoustics properties get the same label. By doing so, the audio signal is automatically segmented into a sequence of abstract acoustic events. This is specially useful to classify huge multimedia databases where a human driven segmentation is not practicable. This automatic classification allow a fast indexing and retrieval of audio fragments. This audio segmentation is done using competitive hidden Markov models as the main classification engine and, thus, no previous classified or hand-labeled data is needed. This powerful classification tool also has a great flexibility and offers the possibility to customize the matching criterion as well as the average segment length according to the application needs.  The first stage in a classification system is the parameterization part where some features are obtained from the raw audio signal. The aim of this parameterization stage is to calculate a set of values that represent the main characteristics of the audio samples. The nature of the parameterization is strongly dependent on the application since it will determine the set of abstract acoustic units and, therefore, the underlying structure of a certain sound. The main classification engine in our system is based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). HMMs have proven to be a very powerful tool to statistically model a process that varies in time. The idea behind them is very simple. Consider a stochastic process from an unknown source and we only have access to its output in time. HMMs are well suited to model this kind of events. From this point of view, HMMs can be seen as a doubly embedded stochastic process with a process that is not observable (hidden process) and can only be observed through another stochastic process (observable process) that produces the time set of observations. However, after examining the audio segmentation problem, we can see that usual HMM training is completely useless because we do not have a priori information about the segmentation. In traditional HMM the training procedure uses a labeled observation sequence and parameter estimation is based on learning from examples. For example, in speech recognition, the training database is labeled with the phonemes of the speech sequences. By doing so, HMMs learn from examples of each phoneme and they use this knowledge to identify similar patterns in the recognition stage. But the problem we are dealing with in automatic music segmentation is very different (and by far more difficult). Our main goal is to blindly identify similar (in some sense) audio segments and therefore we do not have any previous knowledge to train traditional HMMs. Thus, this is clearly an example of HMMs unsupervised training. Competitive Hidden Markov Models have proved to be specially well suited for this kind of situations. CoHMM are different to HMM mainly in the training stage since the recognition stage (or classification) shares the common algorithm. In this paper we also show some results that prove that coHMM converge to a realistic segmentation architecture.",ESP,education,Developed economies,"[-1.0213434, -4.7329006]","[-8.030196, 1.6765993]","[2.5099664, -0.6485976, -1.5585523]","[-1.023839, -8.643452, -6.3188996]","[11.180826, 8.864341]","[4.6671147, 4.8605814]","[14.594179, 8.205524, -1.7212178]","[5.608668, 10.819298, 13.80536]"

16,David Huron,Perceptual and Cognitive Applications in Music Information Retrieval.,2000,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1414794,David Huron+Ohio State University>USA>education,"Music librarians and cataloguers have traditionally created indexes that allow users to access musical works using standard reference information, such as the name of the composer or the title of the work. While this basic information remains important, these standard reference tags have surprisingly limited applicability in most music-related queries. Music is used for an extraordinary variety of purposes: the restaurateur seeks music that targets a certain clientele; the aerobics instructor seeks a certain tempo; the film director seeks music conveying a certain mood; an advertiser seeks a tune that is highly memorable; the physiotherapist seeks music that will motivate a patient; the truck driver seeks music that will keep him/her alert. Although there are many other uses for music, music’s preeminent functions are social and psychological. The most useful retrieval indexes are those that facilitate searching according to such social and psychological functions. Typically, such indexes will focus on stylistic, mood, and similarity information. In attempting to build such musical indexes, two general questions arise: (1) What is the best taxonomic system by which to classify moods, styles, and other musical characteristics? (2) How can we create automated systems that will reliably characterize recordings or scores? Internet-based music distribution has brought these two questions to the fore. In the case of proprietary musical databases, the second problem can be centrally managed, and perhaps addressed using manual methods. However, past experience with Internet access to text documents implies that non-proprietary decentralized indexing is likely to prove more popular and successful. That is, future music indexes will likely resemble web-wide search engines (like Infoseek or Google) rather than closed proprietary systems (like Beatscape or Encyclopedia Britannica). The problem of building musical web crawlers that traverse the web and index music-related files (such as MP3) should prove challenging. The enabling technology for such musical web crawlers will need to draw extensively on research in music perception and cognition. Consider two sample problems: music summarization and mood characterization.

On the contrary, it is “active” and based on a set of interactions between listeners and musical documents—including automatic music information research and extraction—so as to discover intentions. This recognition process is based on the observation of regularities and rules, in order to build “forms” from all indications, information and redundancies. The listener interprets all the signs that are meaningful for him as intentions, attributed to the composer. Features of computer assisted listening Let us specify further the active listening situation for the musicologist, taking for example the consultation of a document in such a digital library as IRCAM’s. The musicologist is facing a computer screen, while handling scores and books. This terminal allows him, among many other possibilities, to listen to music, to access musical data bases and hypermedia analyses. The musicologist is handling several devices on several media at the same time. First of all, the listener needs a framework that takes him/her into account. The purpose is to set the conditions of possibility of listening by restricting the heuristics of “forms”. It is therefore necessary to set a listening framework for the musicologist, to assist him in discovering the “intentions” of music. The main feature of this listening environment is thus its capacity to enable its user to vary the music representation. In the same way that working on a musical piece leads us either to read it silently or to sol-fa, or to hum it, or to play it, the musicologist’s environment must enable rapid changes of the representation of abstract objects. This is very important: a critical part of the analysis work consists in associating varied representations and contexts. Its purpose is the emergence of meaning from numerous and dissimilar elements that views imagined by the musicologist manage to reconcile. Musical databases help weave these links. In such an environment as the IRCAM Digital Library, we can either: •= associate various representations of music: hypermedia analyses offer sonograms as well as scores or formal schemes. •= or associate various contexts: the musicologist can easily know which works are contemporary with the Marteau sans Maître by Boulez using roughly the same instruments, or explore the musical production of the year 1954.",FRA,facility,Developed economies,"[-20.663506, 30.226164]","[45.55514, -9.183018]","[-11.035848, 25.389164, 5.9067364]","[17.687336, 6.4113274, 12.158862]","[14.12101, 8.339573]","[8.611695, 3.5474129]","[16.71295, 6.515071, -0.9029045]","[7.8793516, 8.084999, 14.032923]"

Because of the lack of standards in music identification – or the lack of enforcement of existing standards – there is a huge amount of unidentified music files in the world. We propose here an identification mechanism that exploits the information possibly contained in the file name itself. We study large corpora of files whose names are decided by humans without particular constraints other than readability, and draw various hypotheses concerning the natural syntaxes that emerge from these corpora. A central hypothesis is the local syntactic consistency, which claims that file name syntaxes, whatever they are, are locally consistent within clusters of related music files. These heuristics allow to parse successfully file names without knowing their syntax a priori, using statistical measures on clusters of files, rather than on parsing files on a strict individual basis. Based on these validated hypothesis we propose a heuristics-based parsing system and illustrate it in the context of an Electronic Music Distribution project.",FRA,company,Developed economies,"[-24.058079, 2.244352]","[6.200994, 8.406278]","[-5.9129868, 9.106775, -25.046436]","[4.262708, 6.7435365, -1.4744053]","[12.851693, 7.9857006]","[5.633424, 3.8645616]","[16.252525, 7.175141, -2.7819996]","[5.910441, 9.174074, 14.516641]"

The structure of the representation is discussed and illustrated with sample algorithms, including some from music information retrieval. The score representation was designed for the development of general algorithms and applications. The common container-iterator paradigm is used, in which the score is modelled as a container of objects, such as clefs, key signatures, time signatures, notes, rests and barlines. Access to objects within the score is achieved through iterators. These iterators provide the developer with a mechanism for accessing the information content of the score. The iterators are designed to achieve a high level of data hiding, so that the user is shielded from the substantial underlying complexity of score representation, while at the same time, having access to the score’s full information content.",IRL,education,Developed economies,"[-4.9684134, 55.21096]","[25.313658, 12.437792]","[-27.99063, 6.218993, 13.027457]","[10.28187, 1.9178103, 2.4130385]","[12.687256, 5.1295047]","[6.9093747, 3.0079207]","[14.967264, 4.8218193, 0.9423036]","[6.434049, 8.323249, 14.728]"

Explicit linkage of relationships among entities is critical for document-based information retrieval. Works contain representations of recorded knowledge. Core bodies of work—canons—function to preserve and disseminate the parameters of a culture. A musical work is an intellectual sonic conception. Musical works take documentary form in a variety of instantiations. Epistemology for documentary analysis provides key perceptual information about the objects of knowledge organization. Works are carriers of knowledge, representing deliberately-constructed packages of both rational and empirical evidence of human knowledge. Smiraglia (2001) suggests the parameters of a theory of the work, incorporating the tools of epistemology to comprehend works by expressing theoretical parameters in the context of a taxonomic definition. A work is a signifying, concrete set of ideational conceptions that finds realization through semantic or symbolic expression. Semiotic analysis suggests a variety of cultural and social roles for works.

This paper focuses on the pitch aspect of melodic similarity, scrutinising the term pitch replacing it by a less ambivalent and overused term, which we will call meloton. Based on the term meloton the paper suggests to approach the issue of ‘melotonic’ similarity from a transformational angle, where transformations are executed as reflections and translations. ‘Melotonic’ similarity then is seen as related to the transformation process in form of a transpositional and interval vector.

In this work, algorithms for the automatic genre categorization of audio signals are described. More specifically, we propose a set of features for representing texture and instrumentation. In addition a novel set of features for representing rhythmic structure and strength is proposed. The performance of those feature sets has been evaluated by training statistical pattern recognition classifiers using real world audio collections. Based on the automatic hierarchical genre classification two graphical user interfaces for browsing and interacting with large audio collections have been developed.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-31.262966, -8.000625]","[12.090944, -4.0048227]","[-18.633297, -14.617555, -0.79117495]","[2.2621815, -13.3643055, -1.3912743]","[13.116853, 11.093242]","[5.1051836, 5.423272]","[15.827743, 9.32473, -2.05965]","[6.14701, 10.408575, 13.039848]"

Papipuun performs quick listening in a manner similar to a stylus skipping on a scratched record, but the skipping occurs correctly at punctuations of musical phrases, not arbitrarily. First, we developed a method for representing polyphony based on time-span reduction in the generative theory of tonal music (GTTM) and the deductive object-oriented database (DOOD). The operation, least upper bound, plays an important role in similarity checking of polyphonies represented in our method. Next, in a preprocessing phase, a user analyzes a set piece by the time-span reduction, using a dedicated tool called TS-Editor. For the real-time phase, the user interacts with the main system, Summarizer, to perform music summarization. Summarizer discovers a piece structure by means of similarity checking. When the user identifies the fragments to be skipped, Summarizer deletes them and concatenates the rest.

One difference between Carnatic music and the better-known Hindusthani music of North India is its embeddedness in a religious-philosophical context. This context crucially determines the objects of knowledge organization and the indigenous theory of musical affect. The author presents the view that a digital library of Carnatic music should contain the objects of knowledge organization and their interrelationships as conceived by indigenous practitioners and audiences, rather than by Western specialists or North Indian practitioners. The author demonstrates how three features of Carnatic music (viz. aural transmission, improvisation and cultural context) have particular implications for the development of a digital library. Aural transmission results in musical documents being less important sources of information than recordings. Improvisation results in a highly transformational and often ambiguous relationship between (intra)musical signifiers and signified, causing problems of classification and machine recognition. The cultural context favours the prioritisation of emotional affect over introductory ease of listening and even technical recording quality in the selection of the recordings to be included in a digital library of Carnatic music.",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[-14.8766165, -23.048637]","[-4.5756235, 20.427507]","[7.003771, 4.0751476, -15.623404]","[1.223143, 15.82685, 14.429902]","[11.582011, 11.306394]","[4.235732, 3.6564927]","[15.257752, 8.288241, 1.3399574]","[4.3133273, 9.482008, 15.01673]"

An adequate separation of notes into different voices is crucial for obtaining readable and usable scores from performances of polyphonic music recorded on keyboard (or other polyphonic) instruments; for improving quantisation results within a transcription system; and in the context of music retrieval systems that primarily support monophonic queries. In this paper we propose a new voice separation algorithm based on a stochastic local search method. Different from many previous approaches, our algorithm allows chords in the individual voices; its behaviour is controlled by a small number of intuitive and musically motivated parameters; and it is fast enough to allow interactive optimisation of the result by adjusting the parameters in real-time. We demonstrate that compared to existing approaches, our new algorithm generates better solutions for a number of typical voice separation problems.

Through a chronological scanning of the score, analogies are inferred between local relationships — namely, notes and intervals — and global structures — namely, patterns — whose paradigms are stored inside an abstract pattern trie (APT). Basic mechanisms for inference of new patterns are described. The same pattern-matching algorithm used for pattern discovery during pre-analysis of musical works is reused during MIR applications.

Two novel methods are presented that constitute the algorithmic core of the system. First, a probabilistic musical meter estimation process is described, which segments a continuous musical signal into patterns. As a side-product, the method outputs tatum, tactus (beat), and measure lengths. A subsequent process performs the actual similarity measurements. Acoustic features are extracted which model the fluctuation of loudness and brightness within the pattern, and dynamic time warping is then applied to align the patterns to be compared.

In short, it tries to detect the pitches in a sung melody and compares these pitches with symbolic representations of the known melodies. Melodies that are similar to the sung pitches are retrieved. Approximate pattern matching in the melody comparison process compensates for the errors in the sung melody by using classical dynamic programming. A filtering method is used to save computation in the dynamic programming framework. This paper presents the algorithms for pitch detection, note onset detection, quantization, melody encoding and approximate pattern matching as they have been implemented in the CubyHum software system. Since human reproduction of melodies is imperfect, findings from an experimental singing study were a crucial input to the development of the algorithms. Future research should pay special attention to the reliable detection of note onsets in any preferred singing style.

PATS generates playlists that suit a particular context-of-use, that is, the real-world environment in which the music is heard. To create playlists, it uses a dynamic clustering method in which songs are grouped based on their attribute similarity. The similarity measure selectively weighs attribute-values, as not all attribute-values are equally important in a context-of-use. An inductive learning algorithm is used to reveal the most important attribute-values for a context-of-use from preference feedback of the user. In a controlled user experiment, the quality of PATS-compiled and randomly assembled playlists for jazz music was assessed in two contexts-of-use. The quality of the randomly assembled playlists was used as base-line. The two contexts-of-use were ‘listening to soft music’ and ‘listening to lively music’. Playlist quality was measured by precision (songs that suit the context-of-use), coverage (songs that suit the context-of-use but that were not already contained in previous playlists) and a rating score.

The strategy employed here is to consider the audio signal as a succession of “states” (at various scales) corresponding to the structure (at various scales) of a piece of music. This is, of course, only applicable to certain kinds of musical genres based on some kind of repetition. From the audio signal, we first derive dynamic features representing the time evolution of the energy content in various frequency bands. These features constitute our observations from which we derive a representation of the music in terms of “states”. Since human segmentation and grouping performs better upon subsequent hearings, this “natural” approach is followed here. The first pass of the proposed algorithm uses segmentation in order to create “templates”. The second pass uses these templates in order to propose a structure of the music using unsupervised learning methods (K-means and hidden Markov model). The audio summary is finally constructed by choosing a representative example of each state.

Repetition is agreed to be one of the most important factors of musical meaningfulness. Therefore repetitive musical phrases are suitable for indexing purposes. The extraction of such phrases can be done by applying an existing text mining method to musical data. Because of the differences between text and musical data the application requires some technical modification of the method.

Although this type of description is of great interest, it is very difficult to implement it into realistic automatic labelling systems because of the necessity of dealing with thousands of categories, hence with thousands of different sound models. Moreover, digitally synthesised or transformed sounds, which are frequently used in most of the contemporary popular music, have no identifiable sources. We propose a description framework, based on Schaeffer’s research on a generalised solfeggio which could be applied to any type of sounds. He defined some morphological description criteria, based on intrinsic perceptual qualities of sound, which doesn’t refer to the cause or the meaning of a sound.

One of the frustrations for libraries, archives, and patrons alike is the gulf between the information about a holding and actual access to it. But users are not the only ones to have an opinion about free access. Local musicians feel that everyone profits from their cultural heritage but them; researchers find themselves held responsible for research recordings made decades earlier and largely forgotten; and some communities seek to protect music that was never meant to be commercialized, and is considered to be secret or divine. Caught in the middle between angry patrons, angry companies, and angry artists, what are music librarians and archivists supposed to do? Using his own experience as a researcher, archivist, and record producer, the author discusses the issues and makes some suggestions that can help those who wish to use the music they can so easily find out about. It is a great honor to be with you at the ISMIR 2003. I have devoted much of my life to making information available for eventual retrieval, and it is nice to be among specialists in doing just that. As a researcher, I have made field recordings among indigenous peoples in remote jungles of Brazil. As the director of an audiovisual archive I wanted to make available as much information as possible about the collections by publishing printed catalogs, entering collection-level information on OCLC, creating in-house databases, and revising depositors’ contracts. As a record company director I have produced hundreds of CDs with extensive liner notes, maintained a vast back catalog in print, and moved early to supplying information on the Internet. As the archival consultant to the Smithsonian Institution's GlobalSound Internet music project, I have continued to search for new ways to make information about music, and music itself, available to as wide a public as we can reach. A huge amount of music is available on the Internet today, and even more music is signaled in myriad archives catalogues. More will music will certainly become available. One problem we face is finding what is there (and also what isn’t). Another problem is finding out how we may use it. The short summary of my talk would be: although you can find it, a variety of forces (not all of them related to greed) shape the way music should be used.

Ellis+Columbia University>USA>education,"Automatic extraction of content description from commercial audio recordings has a number of important applications, from indexing and retrieval through to novel musicological analyses based on very large corpora of recorded performances. Chord sequences are a description that captures much of the character of a piece in a compact form and using a modest lexicon. Chords also have the attractive property that a piece of music can (mostly) be segmented into time intervals that consist of a single chord, much as recorded speech can (mostly) be segmented into time intervals that correspond to specific words. In this work, we build a system for automatic chord transcription using speech recognition tools. For features we use “pitch class profile” vectors to emphasize the tonal content of the signal, and we show that these features far outperform cepstral coefficients for our task. Sequence recognition is accomplished with hidden Markov models (HMMs) directly analogous to subword models in a speech recognizer, and trained by the same Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Crucially, this allows us to use as input only the chord sequences for our training examples, without requiring the precise timings of the chord changes — which are determined automatically during training.

This enables us to measure similarity by using the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) and the Proportional Transportation Distance (PTD), a pseudo-metric for weighted point sets which is based on the EMD. A comparison of our experiment results with earlier work shows that by using weighted point sets and the EMD/PTD instead of Howard’s method (1998) using the DARMS encoding for determining melodic similarity, it is possible to group together about twice as many known occurrences of a melody within the RISM A/II collection.

We attempt to remedy this situation by taking advantage of publicly-available MIDI transcriptions. By force-aligning synthesized audio generated from a MIDI transcription with the raw audio of the song it represents we can correlate note events within the MIDI data with the precise time in the raw audio where that note is likely to be expressed. Having these alignments will support the creation of a polyphonic transcription system based on labeled segments of produced music. But because the MIDI transcriptions we find are of variable quality, an integral step in the process is automatically evaluating the integrity of the alignment before using the transcription as part of any training set of labeled examples. Comparing a library of 40 published songs to freely available MIDI files, we were able to align 31 (78%).

Specifically, we evaluate acoustic techniques based on Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and an intermediate ‘anchor space’ of genre classification, and subjective techniques which use data from The All Music Guide, from a survey, from playlists and personal collections, and from web-text mining. We find the following: (1) Acoustic-based measures can achieve agreement with ground truth data that is at least comparable to the internal agreement between different subjective sources. However, we observe significant differences between superficially similar distribution modeling and comparison techniques. (2) Subjective measures from diverse sources show reasonable agreement, with the measure derived from co-occurrence in personal music collections being the most reliable overall. (3) Our methodology for large-scale cross-site music similarity evaluations is practical and convenient, yielding directly comparable numbers for different approaches.

The relationships between periodicities are then used to find the metrical hierarchy and to estimate the tempo at the beat and measure levels of the hierarchy. The periodicities are then interpreted as musical note values, and the estimated tempo, meter and the distribution of periodicities are used to predict the style of music using a simple set of rules.

The project aims to test the viability of the OAI standard for providing access to sheet music collections on the web, and to build a permanent and increasingly participatory service for the discovery of digital sheet music. The service provider design has been informed by detailed usability testing, and by limitations imposed by the variations in metadata harvested from the different participating collections. Advanced services in addition to basic searching and browsing have been developed, including the ability to save and share subsets across participating collections. Harvesting and searching strategies for overcoming metadata limitations are being developed. The consortium is seeking additional participants with digital sheet music collections, and is exploring the possibility of incorporating scores and audio into the project. Digital sheet music collections were among the earliest substantial music collections to appear on the web. Most significantly, digital sheet music collections have been mounted by the Library of Congress, Johns Hopkins University, and Duke University. There are many other important collections, resulting in a rich distributed research resource for music. Sheet music collections have become the focus of digitization projects for a number of reasons relating to the publication format, its component parts, and the resulting problems in providing access, either through traditional cataloging systems, or by other means. A piece of sheet music generally consists of a number of different components, brought together for a specific publication. These include the music itself, usually consisting of between two and eight pages; a cover page, that often includes graphic artwork and/or a photographic reproduction; and advertisements, either for additional sheet music from the same publisher, or from other vendors. The most common sheet music genre is popular song, and the text of these songs comprises another important element of the publication. It seems likely that providing access to the cover art of sheet music has been the prime motivation for many sheet music projects. The graphic artwork found on published sheet music is often very decorative, and provides information of interest to a wide variety of scholars, including historians of art, cultural historians, sociologists, and so on. Much as sound recordings are today, sheet music of the C19th and early C20th documents taste, attitudes, and societal concerns, across time, and in different geographical locations. Sheet music may also reflect the concerns of specific groups of people (e.g. political publications), or entire nations (e.g. nationalistic publications). Songs that become perennial favorites were often republished with changes in text (e.g. taking out insulting epithets; or perhaps writing completely new words for a favorite tune), new cover graphic arts; or simply changes in the advertising. All of these changes document changing attitudes both musical and non-musical. Traditional cataloging schemes have had a difficult time capturing the disparate elements that make up a single piece of sheet music, let alone the relationships between repeated publications of a single work. In addition sheet music has usually been published as simply music, with little recorded about the cover art or the text. For example, an AACR2 catalog record for a piece of sheet music would typically record the genre (e.g. “Piano music” or “Songs with piano”); include transcriptions of title, attribution, and publication information; and provide access points to composer and lyricist. Information about the cover art and subject of the song—other than that obvious from the title —typically would be absent. These difficulties, both the physical structure and the cataloging problem, along with the recognition that sheet music has unique research potential, have meant that sheet music collections have often found a home among institutional “Special Collections,” rather than in the music library. These problems, along with interest from a wide variety of users, have encouraged the creation of digital sheet.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[32.012737, 18.522982]","[36.707882, 7.305635]","[15.27438, 20.231375, -1.8152083]","[20.126871, -10.421552, 7.7784076]","[10.198175, 8.011421]","[8.122254, 3.0367188]","[13.871252, 6.9386764, -1.0648562]","[7.4847174, 7.87171, 14.712899]"

In this paper, we present an automatic music transcription system dedicated to Tabla - a North Indian percussion instrument. Our approach is based on three main steps: firstly, the audio signal is segmented in adjacent segments where each segment represents a single stroke. Secondly, rhythmic information such as relative durations are calculated using beat detection techniques. Finally, the transcription (recognition of the strokes) is performed by means of a statistical model based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

On a sub-cognitive level, patterns are discovered through the detection, by an associative memory, of local similarities. On a cognitive level, patterns are managed by a general logical framework that avoids irrelevant inferences and combinatorial explosion.

Based on these principles, many divergent theories of melodic segmentation and representation have been proposed. However, these theories have not succeeded in achieving a comprehensive and verifiable representation of melody. This is largely due to the fact that multiple competing segmenting factors produce, for any single melody, a large number of possible segmentations and therefore representations. Here a model is proposed, which incorporates widely accepted principles of segmentation. These rules govern three types of factors: (1) changes in proximity (for producing disjunctive segmentation), (2) changes in overall contour and intervallic texture and (3) patterns and periodicity that create parallelism among segments. Because of the nature of the segmentation rules, these same rules establish the attributes of the groups they produce.

With this, significant improvements compared with conventional “quantization” techniques were found.

The latter method then can detect all the onsets of each drum by using the corresponding adapted template. The onsets of bass and snare drums in any piece can thus be identified.

One solution is to let software agents learn to make the annotator’s task easier and more efficient. Emo is a music annotation prototype that combines inputs from both human and software agents to better study human listening. A compositional theory of musical meaning provides the overall heuristics for the annotation process, with the listener drawing upon different influences such as acoustics, lyrics and cultural metadata to focus on a specific musical mood. Software agents track the way these choices are made from the influences available. A functional theory of human emotion provides the basis for introducing necessary bias into the machine learning agents. Conflicting positive and negative emotions can be separated on the basis of their different function (reward-approach and threat-avoidance) or dysfunction (psychotic). Negative emotions have strong ambiguity and these are the focus of the experiment. The results of mining psychological features of lyrics are promising, recognisable in terms of common sense ideas of emotion and in terms of accuracy.

As the our repertoire of techniques becomes more varied, there are greater requirements of computation power. Distributed storage techniques have become widespread and almost invisible with the advent of file-sharing systems, online digital music stores and online storage services. Even discounting data with potential copyright entanglements, there is a vast amount that is ripe for analysis, and thus parallelised and distributed processing techniques seem increasingly appropriate. Existing frameworks are already capable of a significant amount of audio analysis for music information retrieval. However they are by and large ignorant of distribution and parallelisation. There are middleware libraries to help with aspects of distributed computing, but combining the two can be cumbersome and inefficient. This paper provides a brief description of a software framework that can process audio in a scalable and distributed manner: Geddei. The paper then takes an interesting and relevant signal analysis task often used for music information retrieval and implements it under the Geddei framework. The ease of use is discussed and various measurements taken of Geddei, both in comparison to itself under different circumstances, and ‘reference code’ that was used in a previous study.

It is assumed that each language has its own set of constraints that specify which of the basic linguistic events present in a singing process are allowed to follow another. The acoustic structure of individual languages may, thus, be characterized by statistically modeling those constraints. To this end, the proposed method employs vector clustering to convert a singing signal from its spectrum-based feature representation into a sequence of smaller basic phonological units. The dynamic characteristics of the sequence are then analyzed by using bigram language models. Since the vector clustering is performed in an unsupervised manner, the resulting system does not use sophisticated linguistic knowledge and, thus, is easily portable to new language sets.

A suitable audio fingerprint can be used to identify audio files, even if they are severely degraded due to compression or other types of signal processing operations. When degraded, the fingerprint closely resembles the fingerprint of the original, but is not identical. We plan to use a fingerprint not only to identify the song but also to assess the perceptual quality of the compressed content. In order to develop such a fingerprinting scheme, a model is needed to assess the behavior of a fingerprint subject to compression.

Based on a suitable matching model, the best match between the score and the feature parameters is computed by dynamic programming (DP).

It is shown that, for the results to agree with the listener’s understanding, computer modelling needs to follow as closely as possible the strategies undertaken during the listening process. Motivic patterns, which may progressively follow different musical dimensions, are discovered through an adaptive incremental identification in a multi-dimensional parametric space. The combinatorial redundancy that would logically result from the model is carefully limited with the help of particular heuristics.

The present work explores three time series representations for sung queries: a sequence of notes, a ‘smooth’ pitch contour, and a novel sequence of pitch histograms. Dynamic alignment procedures are described for the three representations. Multiple continuity constraints are explored and a modified dynamic alignment procedure is described for the histogram representation. We measure the performance of the three representations using a collection of naturally sung queries applied to a target database of varying size.

When applied to recordings of polyphonic piano music, the individual notes are identified as salient features, and hence each short-term spectrum is decomposed into a sum of note spectra; the resulting encoding can be used as a basis for polyphonic transcription. The system is based on a probabilistic model equivalent to a form of noisy independent component analysis (ICA) or sparse coding with non-negativity constraints. We introduce a novel modification to this model that recognises that a short-term Fourier spectrum can be thought of as a noisy realisation of the power spectral density of an underlying Gaussian process, where the noise is essentially multiplicative and non-Gaussian.

Google is used to determine which of these candidates are in fact related by assessing the co-occurrence of the two artists’ names on Internet web pages.

None of the previous methods can accurately recognize musical chords from complex audio signals that contain vocal and drum sounds. The main problem is that the chord-boundary-detection and chord-symbol-identification processes are inseparable because of their mutual dependency. In order to solve this mutual dependency problem, our method generates hypotheses about tuples of chord symbols and chord boundaries, and outputs the most plausible one as the recognition result. The certainty of a hypothesis is evaluated based on three cues: acoustic features, chord progression patterns, and bass sounds.

In MII in polyphonic music, there are three issues: feature variations caused by sound mixtures, the pitch dependency of timbres, and the use of musical context. For the first issue, templates of feature vectors representing timbres are extracted from not only isolated sounds but also sound mixtures. Because some features are not robust in the mixtures, features are weighted according to their robustness by using linear discriminant analysis. For the second issue, we use an F0-dependent multivariate normal distribution, which approximates the pitch dependency as a function of fundamental frequency. For the third issue, when the instrument of each note is identified, the a priori probability of the note is calculated from the a posteriori probabilities of temporally neighboring notes.

For each window in the input audio, the chroma based representation is interpreted with respect to the precalculated templates that serve as attractor points in tonal space. This leads to a discretization in both time and tonal space making the output representation compact. Local and global variations in tempo are accounted for using dynamic time warping that employs a special type of music theoretical distance measure. Evaluation is given in two stages.

In addition, most of the tempo variation is removed; thus a much simpler sequence match method can be adopted. Also, TSR relies on the characteristics of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefﬁcient (MFCC), where the precise match in the second step depends on the first step to filter out most of the dissimilar references with only the low order MFCC feature. As a result, the whole retrieval speed can be further improved. The experimental evaluation verifies that SCBFM-TSR yields more meaningful results in comparatively short time.

The audio recordings may either contain a single instrument performing in solo mode, or an ensemble of instruments where one of the instruments has a leading role. The melody to be spotted is presented to the system as a sequence of note durations and music intervals. In the sequel, this sequence is treated as a pattern prototype and based on it, a VDHMM is constructed. The probabilities of the associated VDHMM are determined according to a set of rules that account (a) for the allowable note duration flexibility and (b) with possible structural deviations from the prototype pattern. In addition, for each raw audio recording in the database, a sequence of note durations and music intervals is extracted by means of a multi pitch tracking algorithm. These sequences are subsequently fed as input to the constructed VDHMM that models the pattern to be located. The VDHMM employs an enhanced Viterbi algorithm, previously introduced by the authors, in order to account for pitch tracking errors and performance improvisations of the instrument players. For each audio recording in the database, the best-state sequence generated by the enhanced Viterbi algorithm is further post-processed in order to locate occurrences of the melody which is searched. Our method has been successfully tested with a variety of cello recordings in the context of Western Classical music, as well as with Greek traditional multi-instrument recordings, in which clarinet has a leading role.",GRC,education,Developed economies,"[-0.29786104, -24.350142]","[-32.406357, 16.230003]","[2.805348, -12.977033, -8.053087]","[-12.634691, -8.890707, -17.70967]","[10.229089, 11.023456]","[2.8747675, 4.3312726]","[14.315693, 9.392174, 0.94086146]","[3.9286413, 10.23094, 13.330463]"

However, similarity has a variety of meanings depending on the nature of the system being developed. More importantly, the features extracted from a music source are often either single-dimensional (i.e.: only pitch, or only rhythm, or only timbre) or else assumed to be orthogonal. In this paper we present a framework for developing systems which combine a wide variety of non-independent features without having to make the independence assumption.

Combinatorial redundancy inherent in the pattern discovery paradigm is usually ﬁltered using global selective mechanisms, based on pattern frequency and length. The proposed approach is founded instead on the concept of closed pattern, and insures lossless compression through an adaptive selection of most speciﬁc descriptions in the multi-dimensional parametric space. A notion of cyclic pattern is introduced, enabling the ﬁltering of another form of combinatorial redundancy provoked by successive repetitions of patterns. The use of cyclic patterns implies a necessary chronological scanning of the piece, and the addition of mechanisms formalising particular Gestalt principles. This study shows therefore that automated analysis of music cannot rely on simple mathematical or statistical approaches, but requires instead a complex and detailed modelling of the cognitive system ruling the listening processes. The resulting algorithm is able to offer for the ﬁrst time compact and relevant motivic analyses of monodies, and may therefore be applied to automated indexing of symbolic music databases.

Our approach starts by obtaining a set of pitch candidates for each time frame, with recourse to an auditory model. Trajectories of the most salient pitches are then constructed. Next, note candidates are obtained by trajectory segmentation (in terms of frequency and pitch salience variations). Too short, low-salience and harmonically related notes are then eliminated. Finally, the notes comprising the melody are extracted. This is the main topic of this paper. We select the melody notes by making use of note saliences and melodic smoothness. First, we select the notes with highest pitch salience at each moment. Then, by the melodic smoothness principle, we exploit the fact that tonal melodies are usually smooth. Thus, long music intervals indicate the presence of possibly erroneous notes, which are substituted by notes that smooth out the melodic contour. Finally, false positives in the extracted melody should be eliminated. To this end, we remove spurious notes that correspond to abrupt drops in note saliences or durations.

The use of a band-wise harmonic/noise decomposition allows the suppression of the deterministic part of the signal, which is mainly contributed by non-rhythmic instruments. The transcription is then performed on the residual noise signal, which contains most of the rhythmic information. This signal is segmented, and the events associated to each onset are classified by support vector machines (SVM) with probabilistic outputs. The features used for classification are directly extracted from the sub-band signals. An additional pre-processing stage in which the instances are reclassified using a localized model was also tested. This transcription method is evaluated on ten test sequences, each of them being performed by two drummers and being available with different mixing settings.

As proved in our previous work (Sagayama et al., 2004) inappropriate common structure function leads to inaccurate analysis results.

The concept of scalable metadata has been introduced to allow metadata to adjust to such trends and alleviate the effects of foreseeable increases of data and metadata size. Here, we argue that scalability fits the needs of the hierarchical structures that allow fast search, and illustrate this by adapting a state-of-the-art search algorithm to a scalable indexing structure.

Because singing voices play an important role in musical pieces with a vocal part, the identification of singer names is useful for music information retrieval systems. The main problem in automatically identifying singers is the negative influences caused by accompaniment sounds. To solve this problem, we developed two methods, accompaniment sound reduction and reliable frame selection. The former method makes it possible to identify the singer of a singing voice after reducing accompaniment sounds. It first extracts harmonic components of the predominant melody from sound mixtures and then resynthesizes the melody by using a sinusoidal model driven by those components. The latter method then judges whether each frame of the obtained melody is reliable (i.e. little influenced by accompaniment sound) or not by using two Gaussian mixture models for vocal and non-vocal frames. It enables the singer identification using only reliable vocal portions of musical pieces. Experimental results with forty popular-music songs by ten singers showed that our method was able to reduce the influences of accompaniment sounds and achieved an accuracy of 95%, while the accuracy for a conventional method was 53%.",JPN,education,Developed economies,"[-13.70653, -40.0808]","[-13.339105, 7.070342]","[7.156499, -11.076068, -23.702965]","[2.2944348, -24.684473, 8.087221]","[10.764521, 12.546336]","[3.673667, 5.175314]","[14.936138, 10.45377, -0.36641678]","[5.5098896, 11.16915, 12.60491]"

Full semantic transcription of audio is an unreliable and imperfect task in the best case, an unsolved problem in the worst. To this end we propose a robust mid-level representation that incorporates both harmonic and rhythmic information, without attempting full transcription. We describe a process for creating this representation automatically, directly from multi-timbral and polyphonic music signals, with an emphasis on popular music. We also offer various evaluations of our techniques. Moreso than most approaches working from raw audio, we incorporate musical knowledge into our assumptions, our models, and our processes.

Errors in audio key finding, typically incorrect assignments of closely related keys, commonly result from imprecise pitch class determination and biases introduced by the quality of the sound. Our technique is motivated by hypotheses on the sources of audio key finding errors, and uses fuzzy analysis to reduce the errors caused by noisy detection of lower pitches, and to refine the biased raw frequency data, in order to extract more correct pitch classes. We compare the proposed system to two others, an earlier one employing only peak detection from FFT results, and another providing direct key finding from MIDI. All three used the same key finding algorithm (Chew’s Spiral Array CEG algorithm) and the same 410 classical music pieces (ranging from Baroque to Contemporary). Considering only the first 15 seconds of music in each piece, the proposed fuzzy analysis technique outperforms the peak detection method by 12.18% on average, matches the performance of direct key finding from MIDI 41.73% of the time, and achieves an overall maximum correct rate of 75.25% (compared to 80.34% for MIDI key finding).",USA,education,Developed economies,"[39.31679, 21.784878]","[-14.678576, 0.9887011]","[15.047166, -5.3297124, 26.791456]","[-5.7689238, 10.556304, -10.509958]","[10.322214, 8.339547]","[5.3447804, 6.247774]","[13.932324, 7.9939346, -2.0683722]","[5.061403, 11.116837, 14.219215]"

To solve this problem, we introduce a new type of chroma-based audio feature that strongly correlates to the harmonic progression of the audio signal. Our feature shows a high degree of robustness to variations in parameters such as dynamics, timbre, articulation, and local tempo deviations.

Traditionally, this analysis is done on paper scores, and most past research in machine-assisted analysis has begun with digital representations of them. Human music students are also taught to hear their musical analyses, however, in both musical recordings and performances. Our approach attempts to teach machines to do the same, beginning with a corpus of recorded Mozart symphonies. The audio files are first transformed into an ordered series of normalized pitch class profile (PCP) vectors. Simplified rules of tonal harmony are encoded in a transition matrix. Classical music tends to change key more frequently than popular music, and so these rules account not only for chords, as most previous work has done, but also for the keys in which they function. A hidden Markov model (HMM) is used with this transition matrix to train Dirichlet distributions for major and minor keys on the PCP vectors.

All of them consider the musical signal as a whole, not trying to reconstruct the listening process of dividing the signal into a number of sources.

The method is computationally very efficient while performing comparably to earlier methods. High efficiency is achieved through multirate accent analysis, discrete cosine transform periodicity analysis, and phase estimation by adaptive comb filtering. During analysis, the music signals are first represented in terms of accentuation on four frequency subbands, and then the accent signals are transformed into periodicity domain. Beat and tatum periods and phases are estimated in a probabilistic setting, incorporating primitive musicological knowledge of beat–tatum relations, the prior distributions, and the temporal continuities of beats and tatums. In an evaluation with 192 songs, the beat tracking accuracy of the proposed method was found comparable to the state of the art.

The paper begins by performing musical instrument recognition with an extensive sound collection using a large set of feature descriptors, achieving a high instrument recognition rate. Next, using Additive Analysis/Synthesis, each sound sample is resynthesized using solely its Harmonic Series. These “Harmonic” samples are then subtracted from the original samples to retrieve the non-harmonic Residuals. Instrument recognition is performed on the resynthesized and the “Residual” sound sets.

The key space is modelled by a 24-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM), where each state represents one of the 24 major and minor keys, and each observation represents a chord transition, or pair of consecutive chords. The use of chord transitions as the observations models a greater temporal dependency between consecutive chords than would observations of single chords. The key transition and chord emission probabilities are initialised using the results of perceptual tests in order to reflect the human expectation of harmonic relationships. HMM parameters are then trained on a per-song basis using hand-annotated chord symbols, before the model for each song is decoded to give the likelihood of each key at each time frame. Examples of the algorithm as a segmentation technique are given, and its capability to estimate the overall key of a song is evaluated using a data set of 110 Beatles songs, of which 91% were correctly classified. An extension to include operation from audio data instead of chord symbols is planned, which will enable application to general music retrieval purposes.",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[36.738647, 23.130234]","[-4.41115, -23.003008]","[13.036997, -3.2100422, 29.1107]","[-10.423601, 12.061645, -7.1427116]","[10.43093, 8.379295]","[5.4455667, 6.901466]","[13.883203, 8.020421, -1.9716376]","[4.8106294, 11.219938, 14.431667]"

Drawing on data collected from nearly 300 annotated parts representing 15 unique works, and 20 musician interviews, we make a number of functionality recommendations for constructive music digital library tool development. For example, all musicians annotate their written music, although this action seems to become more important as the musician becomes more skilled. Musicians’ annotations are comprehensible to anyone who can read music, and are valuable as records of interpretation, interaction, and performance. Musicians annotate at the note (rather than at the phrase or movement) level, their annotations are standardized and formal, and are largely non-text. Music digital libraries that cater to musicians should attempt to provide annotation tools that work at the micro level, and extend the symbolic language of the primary document.

The most salient repetition rate is calculated by cross-correlating dilations of a comb-like prototype spanning multiple frames and the autocorrelation surface.

The proposed mid-level representation is our attempt to bridge the gap between audio and symbolic domains by providing an integrated melodic, rhythmic and structural representation of music signals. The representation is based on a set of melodic fragments extracted from prominent melodic lines, it is beat-synchronous, which makes it independent of tempo variations and contains information on repetitions of short melodic phrases within the analyzed piece.

Okuno+Kyoto University>JPN>education,"This paper presents a hybrid music recommendation method that solves problems of two prominent conventional methods: collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. The former cannot recommend musical pieces that have no ratings because recommendations are based on actual user ratings. In addition, artist variety in recommended pieces tends to be poor. The latter, which recommends musical pieces that are similar to users’ favorites in terms of music content, has not been fully investigated. This induces unreliability in modeling of user preferences; the content similarity does not completely reflect the preferences. Our method integrates both rating and content data by using a Bayesian network called an aspect model. Unobservable user preferences are directly represented by introducing latent variables, which are statistically estimated. To verify our method, we conducted experiments by using actual audio signals of Japanese songs and the corresponding rating data collected from Amazon. The results showed that our method outperforms the two conventional methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and artist variety and can reasonably recommend pieces even if they have no ratings.",JPN,education,Developed economies,"[-43.782986, 29.073439]","[49.368725, 17.10105]","[-23.759817, 20.182745, -0.30388978]","[29.688221, 1.0452775, -2.4364905]","[15.751616, 9.385769]","[8.894383, 5.086089]","[18.393576, 6.83195, -0.5185736]","[9.265793, 9.157594, 14.663704]"

Using previous music players with normal headphones, we can hear only one song at a time and we thus have to play pieces individually to select the one we want to hear from numerous new music files, which involves a large number of mouse operations. The main advantage of our headphones is that they detect natural movements, such as the head or hand moving when users are listening to music and they can focus on a particular musical source that they want to hear. By moving their head left or right, listeners can hear the source from a frontal position as the digital compass detects the change in the direction they are facing. By looking up or down, the tilt sensor will detect the change in the face’s angle of elevation; they can better hear the source that is allocated to a more distant or closer position.

This method is tested on a corpus of string quartet performances, artificially created using Bach four-part chorale harmonizations and sample violin, viola and cello recordings.

The results for the tuning frequency estimation look very good for audio pieces where the dominant voices are tuned close to the equal-temperament scale and exhibit only moderate frequency dynamics. For the analysis of popular western music, the method does not achieve very robust results due to the strong frequency dynamics of the human singing voice. Nevertheless, the method could be improved by excluding the singing voice from the calculation taking only the accompaniment into account.

Two different approaches to singer identification were studied: one where the acoustic features were extracted directly from the polyphonic signal and one where the vocal line was first separated from the mixture using a predominant melody transcription system. The methods are evaluated using a database of songs where the level difference between the singing and the accompaniment varies. It was found that vocal line separation enables robust singer identification down to 0dB and -5dB singer-to-accompaniment ratios.",FIN,education,Developed economies,"[-13.333366, -40.66136]","[-13.459853, 6.7698693]","[6.1977105, -12.58043, -22.935368]","[1.5430788, -24.854115, 7.187688]","[10.6271715, 12.499397]","[3.5773172, 5.2005324]","[14.806836, 10.525657, -0.40603808]","[5.3810124, 11.257095, 12.609212]"

This results in the basis containing nothing but harmonically structured vectors, even after the learning process, and the activity matrix’s rows containing peaks corresponding to note onset times and amplitudes. Furthermore, additional penalties of mutual uncorrelation and sparseness of rows are placed upon the activity matrix.

Moreover, these tags are community-based and hence give a description of a product through the eyes of a community rather than an expert opinion.

Machine learning offers one promising approach, but it is limited by the availability of labeled training data.

Thus, large amounts of training data can be generated quickly, but it is limited by the accuracy of the alignment, which in turn is ultimately related to the problem of onset detection.

That is, an example may be assigned to a class, and not assigned to the parent of that class. This paper applies a Bayesian framework to combine, or aggregate, a hierarchy of multiple binary classifiers in a principled manner, and consequently improves performance over the hierarchy as a whole. Furthermore, such an approach allows for an arbitrarily complex hierarchy, and does not suffer from classes that are too broad or too refined.

Many MIR tasks require information about musical structure, or would perform better if such information were available. Automatic derivation of musical structure faces two significant obstacles. Firstly, the solution space of possible structural analyses of a piece is very large. Secondly, pieces can have more than one valid structural analysis, and there is little firm agreement among music theorists about how to distinguish a good analysis. To circumvent the first of these obstacles, software has been developed which derives a tractable ‘matrix’ of possibilities from a musical surface (i.e., MIDI-like note-time information). The matrix is somewhat like the intermediate results of a dynamic-programming algorithm, and in a similar way it is possible to extract a particular structural analysis from the matrix by following the appropriate path from the top level to the surface. It therefore provides a tool to facilitate research on the second obstacle by allowing candidate ‘goodness’ metrics to be incorporated into the software and tested on actual music.",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[4.8550615, 3.5872056]","[3.9916344, -15.137424]","[-2.8674817, 2.4424496, 8.616429]","[-2.2837036, 10.238515, 4.86775]","[11.647581, 8.909861]","[5.4361978, 4.2707176]","[14.695576, 7.71752, -0.13324057]","[5.402343, 9.33281, 14.264924]"

The method segments a piece into uniform time slices, and determines the most likely key in each slice. It then generates the visualization by dynamically showing the sequence of keys as translucent, growing discs on the two-dimensional plane. The frequency of a key is indicated by the size of its colored disc. Each color and position corresponds to a key, and related keys are shown in proximity with related colors. The visual result effectively presents the changing distribution of the keys employed. The proposed visualization is an improvement over more basic charting methods, such as histograms, and it maintains standards of information design in the form of added dimensionality, color, and animation. We show that the visualization is invariant under music transformations that preserve the piece’s identity.

The segmentation stage uses groups of contiguous chroma vectors as input and identifies sections that are candidates for unique local keys in relation to their neighboring key centers. Non-negative matrix factorization with additional sparsity constraints and additive updates is used for segmentation.

A dozen of descriptors have been designed, some of them dedicated to low-level characterizations of the onset detection curve, whereas the major part concentrates on descriptions of the periodicities developed throughout the temporal evolution of music. A high number of variants have been derived from the systematic exploration of alternative methods proposed in the literature on onset detection curve estimation. To evaluate the pulse clarity model and select the best predictors, 25 participants have rated the pulse clarity of one hundred excerpts from movie soundtracks.

In each data set the rhythms are ranked either according to increasing complexity using the judgements of human subjects, or using calculations with the computational models. Spearman rank correlation coefficients are computed between all pairs of rhythm rankings. Then phylogenetic trees are used to visualize and cluster the correlation coefficients. Among the many conclusions evident from the results, there are several observations common to all three data sets that are worthy of note. The syncopation measures form a tight cluster far from other clusters. The human performance measures fall in the same cluster as the syncopation measures. The complexity measures based on statistical properties of the inter-onset-interval histograms are poor predictors of syncopation or human performance complexity.

We use 4 different types of acoustic content and social context feature sets to describe a large music corpus and derive 4 individual kernel matrices from these feature sets. Each kernel is used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for each semantic tag (e.g., ‘aggressive’, ‘classic rock’, ‘distorted electric guitar’) in a large tag vocabulary. We examine the individual performance of each feature kernel and then show how to learn an optimal linear combination of these kernels using convex optimization. We find that the retrieval performance of the SVMs trained using the combined kernel is superior to SVMs trained using the best individual kernel for a large number of tags.

However, conventional DP-based sequence matching methods cannot be directly applied for self-similarity matrices because they cannot treat gaps independently of other time frames. We resolve this problem by introducing “matched element indices,” which reflect the history of matching, to a DP-based sequence matching method. We performed experiments using musical audio signals.

Inspired by a model of auditory cortical processing, multiscale spectro-temporal modulation features are extracted. Such spectro-temporal modulation features have been successfully used in various content-based audio classification tasks recently, but not yet in music genre classification. Each recording is represented by a third-order feature tensor generated by the auditory model. Thus, the ensemble of recordings is represented by a fourth-order data tensor created by stacking the third-order feature tensors associated to the recordings. To handle large data tensors and derive compact feature vectors suitable for classification, three multilinear subspace techniques are examined, namely the Non-Negative Tensor Factorization (NTF), the High-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), and the Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). Classification is performed by a Support Vector Machine. Stratified cross-validation tests on the GTZAN dataset and the ISMIR 2004 Genre one demonstrate the advantages of NTF and HOSVD versus MPCA.

However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption is often violated. For example, for a popular song there often exist various structurally different album, radio, or extended versions. Or, in classical music, different recordings of the same piece may exhibit omissions of repetitions or significant differences in parts such as solo cadenzas. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for automatically detecting structural similarities and differences between two given versions of the same piece. The key idea is to perform a single structural analysis for both versions simultaneously instead of performing two separate analyses for each of the two versions.

To date, many applications designed to perform such tasks have risen to popularity; each relies on a specific form of music metadata to help consumers discover songs and artists that appeal to their tastes. Very few of these applications, however, analyze the signal waveforms of songs directly. This low-level representation can provide dimensions of information that are inaccessible by metadata alone. To address this issue, we have implemented signal-based measures of musical similarity that have been optimized based on their correlations with human judgments. Furthermore, multiple recommendation engines relying on these measures have been implemented. These systems recommend songs to volunteers based on other songs they find appealing. Blind experiments have been conducted in which volunteers rate the systems’ recommendations along with recommendations of leading online music discovery tools (Allmusic which uses genre labels, Pandora which uses musicological analysis, and Last.fm which uses collaborative filtering), random baseline recommendations, and personal recommendations by the first author.

The proposed beat tracking introduces two key techniques, that is, spectro-temporal pattern matching and echo cancellation. The former realizes robust tempo estimation with a shorter window length, thus, it can quickly adapt to tempo changes. The latter is effective to cancel self periodic noises such as stepping, scatting, and singing. We constructed a robot singer based on the proposed beat tracking for Honda ASIMO. The robot detects a musical beat with its own microphone in a noisy environment. It tries to recognize music based on the detected musical beat. When it successfully recognizes music, it sings while stepping according to the beat. Otherwise, it performs scatting instead of singing because the lyrics are unavailable.

None of the current approaches deal with such complexity. Most of them consider only simple chord patterns, in the best cases, including sevenths. In addition, when considering symbolic data captured from a MIDI guitar, we need to deal with non quantized and noisy data, which increases the difficulty of the task. The current symbolic approaches deal only with quantized data, with no automatic technique to reduce noise. This paper proposes a new approach to recognize chords, from symbolic MIDI guitar data, called COCHONUT (Complex Chords Nutting). The system uses contextual harmonic information to solve ambiguous cases, integrated with other techniques, such as decision theory, optimization, pattern matching and rule-based recognition. The results are encouraging and provide strong indications that the use of harmonic contextual information, integrated with other techniques, can actually improve the results currently found in literature.""",BRA,education,Developing economies,"[60.28162, -8.670423]","[-1.7923017, -29.148571]","[16.439173, -15.893031, 15.333367]","[-12.0395565, 15.438432, -1.8186448]","[7.4090962, 9.836141]","[5.795973, 7.374661]","[11.662279, 9.248776, 0.51364213]","[4.615297, 11.333178, 14.761156]"

The main motivating example is guitar chord recognition, where the physical layout and structure of the instrument, along with human physical and temporal constraints, make certain chord voicings and chord sequences more likely than others. Pitch classes are first extracted using the Pitch Class Profile (PCP) technique, and chords are then recognized using Artificial Neural Networks. The chord information is then analyzed using an array of voicing vectors (VV) indicating likelihood for chord voicings based on constraints of the instrument.

Nevertheless, this interrelationship has not been utilized in the literature as far as the authors are aware. In this paper, bass lines are utilized as clues for improving chord recognition because they can be regarded as an element of the melody. A probabilistic framework is devised to uniformly integrate bass lines extracted by using bass pitch estimation into a hypothesis-search-based chord recognition. To prune the hypothesis space of the search, the hypothesis reliability is defined as the weighted sum of three reliabilities: the likelihood of Gaussian Mixture Models for the observed features, the joint probability of chord and bass pitch, and the chord transition N-gram probability.

Many past algorithms for chord labelling are based on chromagrams, but distribution of energy in chroma frames is not well understood. Furthermore, non-chord notes complicate chord estimation. We present a new approach which uses as a basis a relatively simple chroma model to represent short-time sonorities derived from melody range and bass range chromagrams. A chord is then modelled as a mixture of these sonorities, or subchords. We prove the practicability of the model by implementing a hidden Markov model (HMM) for chord labelling, in which we use the discrete subchord features as observations. We model gamma-distributed chord durations by duplicate states in the HMM, a technique that had not been applied to chord labelling. We test the algorithm by five-fold cross-validation on a set of 175 hand-labelled songs performed by the Beatles. Accuracy figures compare very well with other state of the art approaches.

Extending the work of Aucouturier, we introduce several new methods of homogenization. On a subset of the uspop data set, model homogenization improves artist R-precision by a maximum of 3.5% and agreement to user collection co-occurrence data by 7.4%. We also explore differences in the effectiveness of the various homogenization methods for hub reduction. Further, we extend the modeling of frame-based MFCC features by using a kernel density estimation approach to non-parametric modeling.

The distance between each two segments is then calculated and the value is transformed to a probability that the two segments are occurrences of a same musical part. Different features are combined in the probability space and are used to define a fitness measure for a candidate structure description. Musicological knowledge of the temporal dependencies between the parts is integrated into the fitness measure. A novel search algorithm is presented for finding the description that maximises the fitness measure. The system is evaluated with a data set of 557 manually annotated popular music pieces.

For instance, while frequently bass-lines in rock music have constant pitch and a uniform rhythm, in jazz music there are many characteristic movements such as walking bass. We propose a representative bass-line pattern template extraction method based on k-means clustering handling a pitch-shift problem.

Chronicle defines basic blocks for representing time-based information using events, a hierarchy of groups and instantiable templates. It supports two modes of timing: local timing within a group and association with other elements. The built-in mechanism for resolving time references can be used to implement both timescale mappings and tagging of information. Chronicle aims to be a powerful and flexible foundation on which new file formats and software can be built. Chronicle focuses on structure and timing, but leaves the actual content free to choose. Thus format- or software-developers can specify their own domain-model. This makes it possible to make representations for different types of musical information (scores, performance data, ...) in different styles or cultures (CMN, non-western, contemporary, ...), but also for other domains like choreography, scheduling, task management, and so on. It is also ideal for structured tagging of audio and multimedia (movie subtitles, karaoke, synchronisation, ...) and for representing internal data used in music algorithms.

We propose learning to map subjective audio descriptors, such as “boomy”, onto measures of signal properties in order to build a simple controller that manipulates an audio reverberator in terms of a chosen descriptor. For example, “make the sound less boomy”. In the learning process, a user is presented with a series of sounds altered in different ways by a reverberator and asked to rate how well each sound represents the audio concept. The system correlates these ratings with reverberator parameters to build a controller that manipulates reverberation in the user’s terms. In this paper, we focus on developing the mapping between reverberator controls, measures of qualities of reverberation and user ratings.

In this paper, we propose an novel approach for clustering music items represented in social tagging systems. Its characteristic is that it determines similarity between items by preserving the 3-way relationships among the inherent dimensions of the data, i.e., users, items, and tags. Conversely to existing approaches that use reductions to 2-way relationships (between items-users or items-tags), this characteristic allows the proposed algorithm to consider the personal perspectives of tags and to improve the clustering quality. Due to the complexity of social tagging data, we focus on spectral clustering that has been proven effective in addressing complex data. However, existing spectral clustering algorithms work with 2-way relationships. To overcome this problem, we develop a novel data-modeling scheme and a tag-aware spectral clustering procedure that uses tensors (high-dimensional arrays) to store the multi-graph structures that capture the personalised aspects of similarity.

A common method of beat annotation is simply to tap along with audio and record the tap times. This raises the question: How accurate are the taps? It may seem that an answer to this question would require knowledge of “true” beat times. However, tap times can be characterized as a random distribution around true beat times. Multiple independent taps can be used to estimate not only the location of the true beat time, but also the statistical distribution of measured tap times around the true beat time.

This paper investigates the relationship between direction of physical movement and underlying musical structures. The Vicon motion capture system is used to record 3D movements made by nine university-level pianists performing Chopin preludes op.28 Nos 6 and 7. The examination of several pianists provides insight into the similarity and differences in gestures between performers and how these relate to structure. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of these performances and consequent analysis of variance reveals a relationship between extrema of the first six significant components and timing of phrasing structure in Prelude 7 where motion troughs consistently lag behind the occurrence of phrase boundaries in the audio. This relationship is then examined for Prelude 6 which encompasses longer, expanded phrases and changes in rhythm.

Our goal was to design a robust algorithm that would approximate manual segmentation of field recordings. First, short audio fragments are classified into one of the following categories: speech, solo singing, choir singing, instrumental or bell chiming performance. Then, a set of candidate segment boundaries is obtained by observing how the energy of the signal and its content change, and finally the recording is segmented with a probabilistic model that maximizes the posterior probability of segments given a set of candidate segment boundaries with their probabilities and prior knowledge of lengths of segments belonging to different categories.

Therefore, harmony perception often is explained by the notions of dissonance and tension, computing the consonance of one or two intervals. In this paper, a theory on harmony perception based on the notion of periodicity is introduced. Mathematically, periodicity is derivable from the frequency ratios of the tones in the chord with respect to its lowest tone. The used ratios can be computed by continued fraction expansion and are psychophysically motivated by the just noticeable differences in pitch perception.

Most current audio chord detection algorithms use hidden Markov model (HMM) classifiers because of the task similarity with automatic speech recognition. For most speech recognition algorithms, the performance is measured by word error rate; i.e., only the identity of recognized segments is considered because word boundaries in continuous speech are often ambiguous. In contrast, audio chord detection performance is typically measured in terms of frame error rate, which considers both timing and classification. This paper treats these two tasks separately and focuses on the first problem; i.e., classifying the correct chords given boundary information. The best performing chroma/HMM chord detection algorithm, as measured in the 2008 MIREX Audio Chord Detection Contest, is used as the baseline in this paper. Further improvements are made to reduce feature correlation, account for differences in tuning, and incorporate minimum classification error (MCE) training in obtaining chord HMMs. Experiments demonstrate that classification rates can be improved with tuning compensation and MCE discriminative training.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[63.28865, -12.73894]","[-6.632047, -26.706272]","[23.160658, -18.027292, 19.058193]","[-15.900845, 16.518776, -8.471251]","[6.757991, 10.339254]","[5.822476, 7.6579566]","[11.225715, 9.568228, 1.0367469]","[4.589815, 11.679944, 14.8355]"

The original pLSI can be applied to collaborative filtering by treating users and items as discrete random variables that follow multinomial distributions. In hybrid recommendation, it is necessary to deal with musical contents that are usually represented as continuous vectorial values. To do this, we propose a continuous pLSI that incorporates Gaussian mixture models. This extension, however, causes a severe local optima problem because it increases the number of parameters drastically. This is considered to be a major factor generating “hubs,” which are items that are inappropriately recommended to almost all users. To solve this problem, we tested three smoothing techniques: multinomial smoothing, Gaussian parameter tying, and artist-based item clustering. The experimental results revealed that although the first method improved nothing, the others significantly improved the recommendation accuracy and reduced the hubness. This indicates that it is important to appropriately limit the model complexity to use the pLSI in practical.",JPN,facility,Developed economies,"[-42.799263, 31.094906]","[49.693684, 16.653315]","[-24.907366, 22.578556, -0.85788447]","[30.416285, 1.9514605, -3.5898554]","[15.772401, 9.38355]","[8.86366, 5.107518]","[18.299099, 6.8378434, -0.40099177]","[9.318028, 9.294297, 14.592041]"

We explore the idea of tag propagation to help alleviate the data sparsity problem. Tag propagation, originally proposed by Sordo et al., involves annotating a novel artist with tags that have been frequently associated with other similar artists. In this paper, we explore four approaches for computing artists similarity based on different sources of music information (user preference data, social tags, web documents, and audio content). We compare these approaches in terms of their ability to accurately propagate three different types of tags (genres, acoustic descriptors, social tags).

We present the design and preliminary results of an experiment comparing five algorithms using this new evaluation metric, and contrast the results with those obtained by applying several conventional agreement-based evaluation metrics.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-28.116684, 15.248112]","[30.904789, -13.219748]","[-18.756445, 7.583211, 8.754446]","[24.294193, 17.658585, -0.6022284]","[14.044077, 9.493682]","[7.624879, 6.190252]","[17.05297, 7.7541122, -1.4426357]","[8.278675, 9.706181, 13.151131]"

The experimental results show that the search accuracy is increased by more than 40% compared with the normal text retrieval method; and by 2% ∼4% compared with the conventional phonetic string matching method. Considering the high computation complexity of DP matching, the authors propose a novel two-pass search strategy to shorten the processing time. By pre-selecting the probable candidates by a rapid index-based search for the first pass and executing a DP-based search among these candidates during the second pass, the proposed method reduces processing time by 85.8% and keeps search accuracy at the same level as that of a complete search by DP matching with all lyrics.",JPN,company,Developed economies,"[-23.643211, -29.270168]","[11.512893, 30.004303]","[-8.628633, -12.367579, -27.406954]","[15.902746, 11.3398905, -11.388256]","[11.645869, 12.442224]","[6.061687, 2.9645038]","[15.769983, 10.35874, 0.11929528]","[6.1947246, 8.993148, 15.60926]"

The mixture signal is decomposed into a sum of spectral bases modeled as a product of excitations and filters. The excitations are restricted to harmonic spectra and their fundamental frequencies are estimated in advance using a multipitch estimator, whereas the filters are restricted to have smooth frequency responses by modeling them as a sum of elementary functions on the Mel-frequency scale. The pitch and timbre information are used in organizing individual notes into sound sources. In the recognition, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are used to represent the coarse shape of the power spectrum of sound sources and Gaussian mixture models are used to model instrument-conditional densities of the extracted features. The method is evaluated with polyphonic signals, randomly generated from 19 instrument classes.

Our interface allows a user, by swinging a conducting hardware interface, to conduct the desired global tempo along the playback of a piece, at any time in the piece. The real-time conducting input by the user dynamically switches the interpretation being played back to the one closest to how the user is currently conducting. At the end of the piece, our interface ranks each interpretation according to how close the tempo of each interpretation was to the user input. At the core of our interface is an automated tempo estimation method based on audio-score alignment.

To evaluate computer-based chord labeling procedures, one requires ground truth annotations for the underlying audio material. However, the manual generation of such annotations on the basis of audio recordings is tedious and time-consuming. On the other hand, trained musicians can easily derive chord labels from symbolic score data. In this paper, we bridge this gap by describing a procedure that allows for transferring annotations and chord labels from the score domain to the audio domain and vice versa. Using music synchronization techniques, the general idea is to locally warp the annotations of all given data streams onto a common time axis, which then allows for a cross-domain evaluation of the various types of chord labels. As a further contribution of this paper, we extend this principle by introducing a multi-perspective evaluation framework for simultaneously comparing chord recognition results over multiple performances of the same piece of music.

We hypothesize that the organization of these structures are rather directly linked with the “qualia” of the music as sound. To explore the ways in which these structures are connected with the qualities of sounds, a semantic space was extracted from a large collection of musical tags with latent semantic and cluster analysis. The perceptual and musical properties of 19 clusters were investigated by a similarity rating task that used spliced musical excerpts representing each cluster. The resulting perceptual space denoting the clusters correlated high with selected acoustical features extracted from the stimuli. The first dimension related to the high-frequency energy content, the second to the regularity of the spectrum, and the third to the fluctuations within the spectrum.

Conventional methods face a crucial problem known as model selection because they assume that the observed spectra are superpositions of a certain fixed number of bases (sound sources and/or finer parts). iLHA avoids this problem by assuming that the observed spectra are superpositions of a stochastically-distributed unbounded (theoretically infinite) number of bases. Such uncertainty can be treated in a principled way by leveraging the state-of-the-art paradigm of machine learning called Bayesian nonparametrics. To represent a set of time-sliced spectral strips, we formulated nested infinite Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) based on hierarchical and generalized Dirichlet processes. Each strip is allowed to contain an unbounded number of sound sources (GMMs), each of which is allowed to contain an unbounded number of harmonic partials (Gaussians). To train the nested infinite GMMs efficiently, we used a modern inference technique called collapsed variational Bayes (CVB).

Music is oftentimes referred to as a “language of emotion” [1], and it is natural for us to categorize music in terms of its emotional associations. Myriad features, such as harmony, timbre, interpretation, and lyrics affect emotion, and the mood of a piece may also change over its duration. But in developing automated systems to organize music in terms of emotional content, we are faced with a problem that oftentimes lacks a well-defined answer; there may be considerable disagreement regarding the perception and interpretation of the emotions of a song or ambiguity within the piece itself. When compared to other music information retrieval tasks (e.g., genre identification), the identification of musical mood is still in its early stages, though it has received increasing attention in recent years. In this paper we explore a wide range of research in music emotion recognition, particularly focusing on methods that use contextual text information (e.g., websites, tags, and lyrics) and content-based approaches, as well as systems combining multiple feature domains.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-58.365887, -0.86002845]","[44.45244, -24.189697]","[-27.954802, 3.328145, -15.951825]","[19.422026, 16.238892, 9.433993]","[15.495347, 12.147011]","[9.374306, 6.8448887]","[18.590845, 10.19723, 0.44189808]","[9.344068, 8.704357, 12.308346]"

The extraction is focused on overcoming the difficulties due to harmonic / percussive sound interferences, possibility of octave mismatch, and dynamic variation in melody. The main idea of the algorithm is to consider probabilistic relations between melody and polyphonic audio. Melody is assumed to follow a Markov process, and the framed segments of polyphonic audio are assumed to be conditionally independent given the parameters that represent the melody. The melody parameters are estimated using sequential importance sampling (SIS) which is a conventional particle filter method. In this paper, the likelihood and state transition are defined to overcome the aforementioned difficulties. The SIS algorithm relies on sequential importance density, and this density is designed using multiple pitches which are estimated by a simple multi-pitch extraction algorithm. Experimental results show that the considered algorithm outperforms other famous melody extraction algorithms in terms of the raw pitch accuracy (RPA) and the raw chroma accuracy (RCA).",KOR,education,Developing economies,"[-2.4314475, -26.034739]","[-17.724445, 23.230656]","[6.3544135, -11.090523, -11.467801]","[-14.935514, -4.6684136, -15.549306]","[10.108322, 11.194442]","[2.824544, 4.6225915]","[14.30414, 9.509301, 0.9407407]","[4.2272005, 10.864552, 13.631651]"

Frequently these smartphones are also used as portable music players. In this paper we describe GeoShuffle – a prototype system for content-based music browsing and exploration that targets such devices. One of the most interesting aspects of these portable devices is the inclusion of positioning capabilities based on GPS. GeoShuffle adds location-based and time-based context to a user’s listening preferences. Playlists are dynamically generated based on the location of the user, path and historical preferences. Browsing large music collections having thousands of tracks is challenging. The most common method of interaction is using long lists of textual metadata such as artist name or genre. Current smartphones are characterized by small screen real-estate which limits the amount of textual information that can be displayed. We propose self-organizing tag clouds, a 2D tag cloud representation that is based on an underlying self-organizing map calculated using automatically extracted audio features. To evaluate the system the Magnatagatune database is utilized. The evaluation indicates that location and time context can improve the quality of music recommendation and that self-organizing tag clouds provide faster browsing and are more engaging than text-based tag clouds.",CAN,education,Developed economies,"[-38.80245, 10.527812]","[38.5155, 25.343771]","[-28.265543, 3.6669672, -3.0546603]","[21.02193, 4.332839, -15.699667]","[14.570368, 10.044989]","[7.9483747, 4.556923]","[17.543337, 8.115772, -1.5124538]","[8.209014, 9.054241, 15.06562]"

Most of the previous approaches assume that the score and the performance to be synchronized globally agree with regard to the overall musical structure. In practice, however, this assumption is often violated. For example, a performer may deviate from the score by ignoring a repeat or introducing an additional repeat that is not written in the score. In this paper, we introduce a synchronization approach that can cope with such structural differences. As main technical contribution, we describe a novel variant of dynamic time warping (DTW), referred to as JumpDTW, which allows for handling jumps and repeats in the alignment. Our approach is evaluated for the practically relevant case of synchronizing score data obtained from scanned sheet music via optical music recognition to corresponding audio recordings.

To go beyond the simple extraction of all time intervals between onsets (notes on extraction), we select notes according to their length (short and long extractions) or their intensities (intensity+/− extractions). Once the rhythm is extracted, we use dynamic programming to compare several sequences. We report results of analysis on the size of rhythm patterns that are specific to a unique piece, as well as experiments on similarity queries (ragtime music and Bach chorale variations). These results show that long and intensity+ extractions are often good choices for rhythm extraction.

Observations of musicologists studying historical recordings of classical music were conducted at the British Library. The observations show that the musicologists alternate between a closed listening practice, relying exclusively on aural observations, and a multimodal listening practice, where they interact with various music representations and information sources using different media (e.g. metadata about the recordings and performers, sound visualisations, scores, lyrics and performance videos). The spoken parts of broadcast recordings brought historical/extra-musical clues helping to understand music performance practices.

It is well known that each feature vector stemming from a union of independent linear subspaces admits a sparse representation with respect to a dictionary formed by all other feature vectors with nonzero coefficients associated only to feature vectors that stem from its own subspace. Such sparse representation reveals the relationships among the feature vectors and it is used to construct a similarity graph, the so-called ℓ1-graph.

The three measures led to consistent findings that lyrics of negative and sad songs demonstrate higher linguistic creativity than those of positive and happy songs. Our findings support previous studies in psycholinguistics that people write more creatively when the text conveys sad or negative sentiment, and contradict previous research that positive mood triggers more unusual word associations. The result also indicates that different measures capture different aspects of lyrics creativity.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-49.42719, -0.026549557]","[47.071426, -18.162632]","[-19.328072, 0.61203754, -14.880372]","[26.333242, 16.661743, 10.719387]","[15.371454, 11.354414]","[9.492429, 6.3892827]","[17.763767, 9.9004135, -0.043659277]","[9.32017, 8.797908, 12.687748]"

First, we show that the evaluation of autotagging techniques is fragile in the sense that small alterations to the set of tags to be learned, or in the set of music pieces may lead to dramatically different results. Hence we stress a set of methodological recommendations regarding data and evaluation metrics. Second, we conduct experiments on the generality of autotagging models, showing that a number of different methods at a similar performance level to the state-of-the-art fail to learn tag models able to generalize to datasets from different origins.

A dynamic thresholding scheme is used to locate the potential positions of transients in the signal. The iterative procedure ensures that genuine transients are built up while the localised spectral noise are suppressed by using an energy criterion. The extracted transient signal is later compared to a ground truth dataset. The algorithm performed well on two databases. On the EBU-SQAM database of monophonic sounds, the algorithm achieved an F-measure of 90% while on our database of polyphonic audio an F-measure of 91% was achieved.

We must cope with uncertainty in the audio signal generated from the score in a symbolic representation such as the variation in the timbre or temporal fluctuations. Existing audio-to-score alignment methods are sometimes vulnerable to the uncertainty in which multiple notes are simultaneously played with a variety of timbres because these methods rely on static observation models. For example, a chroma vector or a fixed harmonic structure template is used under the assumption that musical notes in a chord are all in the same volume and timbre. This paper presents a particle filter-based audio-to-score alignment method with a flexible observation model based on latent harmonic allocation.

A new annotated dataset significantly larger in size and with a more diverse range of musical styles became available in 2011. This new dataset comprises over 1,300 songs spanning pop, jazz, classical, and world music styles. The algorithms from the 2010 iteration of MIREX are re-evaluated against this new dataset. This paper presents a detailed analysis of these evaluation results in order to gain a better understanding of the current state-of-the-art in automatic structure segmentation.

Robotic instruments that generate sound acoustically using actuators have been increasingly developed and used in performances and compositions over the past 10 years. Although such devices can be very sophisticated mechanically, in most cases they are passive devices that directly respond to control messages from a computer. In the few cases where more sophisticated control and feedback is employed it is in the form of simple mappings with little musical understanding. Several techniques for extracting musical information have been proposed in the field of music information retrieval. In most cases the focus has been the batch processing of large audio collections rather than real time performance understanding. In this paper we describe how such techniques can be adapted to deal with some of the practical problems we have experienced in our own work with music robotics. Of particular importance is the idea of self-awareness or proprioception in which the robot(s) adapt their behavior based on understanding the connection between their actions and sound generation through listening. More specifically we describe techniques for solving the following problems: 1) controller mapping 2) velocity calibration, and 3) gesture recognition.""",CAN,education,Developed economies,"[-21.691463, 14.213175]","[-9.268417, 30.913803]","[3.38555, 22.982327, -15.379067]","[-12.037526, 8.35991, 22.651384]","[13.868898, 8.501379]","[6.9452314, 3.3372602]","[16.435385, 6.661816, -0.7696296]","[6.2722006, 8.410966, 13.886479]"

By only considering repeated segments of a song, our method can smooth the features without losing chord boundary information and fine details of the original feature. While a similar existing technique requires several hard decisions such as beat quantization and segmentation, our method uses a simple pragmatic approach based on recurrence plot to decide which repeated parts to include in the smoothing process. This approach uses a more formal definition of the repetition search and allows shorter (“chord-size”) repeated segments to contribute to the feature improvement process.

This phenomenon is most striking in syncopated rhythms, found in many genres of music, including music of non-Western cultures. In general, syncopated rhythms may have energy at frequencies that do not correspond to perceived pulse or meter, and perceived metrical frequencies that are weak or absent in the objective rhythmic stimulus. In this paper, we consider syncopated rhythms that contain little or no energy at the pulse frequency. We used 16 rhythms (3 simple, 13 syncopated) to test a model of pulse/meter perception based on nonlinear resonance, comparing the nonlinear resonance model with a linear analysis. Both models displayed the ability to differentiate between duple and triple meters, however, only the nonlinear model exhibited resonance at the pulse frequency for the most challenging syncopated rhythms.

We apply Mutual Proximity to a widely used and standard content-based audio similarity algorithm. The algorithm is known to be negatively affected by the high number of hubs it produces. We show that without a modification of the audio similarity features or inclusion of additional knowledge about the datasets, applying Mutual Proximity leads to a significant increase of retrieval quality: (1) hubs decrease and (2) the k-nearest-neighbor classification rates increase significantly.

Secondly, we consider its simple refinement by adding a minimum amount of genre metadata. We compare the proposed approaches with one content-based and three metadata-based baselines. As such, we consider content-based approach working on inferred semantic descriptors, a tag-based recommender exploiting artist tags, a commercial black-box recommender partially employing collaborative filtering information, and a simple genre-based random recommender. We conduct a listening experiment with 19 participants. The obtained results reveal that although the low-level/semantic content-based approach does not achieve the performance of the baseline working exclusively on the inferred semantic descriptors, the proposed refinement provides significant improvement in the listeners’ satisfaction comparable with metadata-based approaches, and surpasses these approaches by the number of novel relevant recommendations.

Although most of nowadays techniques are robust to the majority of them, the quasi-systematic use of a spectral representation makes them possibly sensitive to pitch-shifting. This distortion indeed induces a modification of the spectral content of the signal. In this paper, we propose a novel fingerprint technique, relying on a hashing technique coupled with a CQT-based fingerprint, with a strong robustness to pitch-shifting. Furthermore, we have associated this method with an efficient post-processing for the removal of false alarms. We also present the adaptation of a database pruning technique to our specific context. We have evaluated our approach on a real-life broadcast monitoring scenario. The analyzed data consisted of 120 hours of real radio broadcast (thus containing all the distortions that would be found in an industrial context). The reference database consisted of 30,000 songs.

In particular, the supervised type of NMF is garnering much attention in source separation with respect to the analysis accuracy and speed. In this approach, a large number of spectral samples is used for analyzing a signal. If the system has a minimal number of samples, the accuracy deteriorates. Because such methods require all the possible samples for the analysis, it is hard to build a practical analysis system. To analyze signals properly even when short of samples, we propose a novel method that combines a supervised NMF and probabilistic search algorithms. In this approach, it is assumed that each instrumental category has a model-invariant feature called a probabilistic spectrum envelope (PSE). The algorithm starts with learning the PSEs of each category using a technique based on Gaussian Process Regression.

However, in the music notation model proposed by the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI), the hierarchy of the XML sub-tree representing the music emphasizes the content rather than the layout. Since systems and pages do not coincide with the musical content, they are encoded in a secondary hierarchy that contains very limited information. In this paper, we present a complementary solution for augmenting the level of detail of the layout of musical documents; that is, the layout information can be encoded in a separate sub-tree with cross-references to other elements holding the musical content.

Both examples have vocal parts exhibiting complex pitch evolution, difficult to analyze and notate with precision using Western common music notation. By using novel time-frequency analysis techniques that improve the location of the components of a harmonic sound, the melodic content representation implemented here allows a detailed study of aspects related to pitch intonation and tuning.

To find such parts in audio recordings of folk songs, segmentation methods can be used that split a recording into separate parts according to different criteria. Most audio segmentation methods were developed for popular and classical music, however these do not perform well on folk music recordings. This is mainly because folk song recordings contain a number of specific issues that are not considered by these methods, such as inaccurate singing of performers, variable tempo throughout the song and the presence of noise. In recent years several methods for segmentation of folk songs were developed. In this paper we present a novel method for segmentation of folk songs into repeating stanzas that does not rely on additional information about an individual stanza. The method consists of several steps. In the first step breathing (vocal) pauses are detected, which represent the candidate beginnings of individual stanzas. Next, a similarity measure is calculated between the first and all other candidate stanzas, which takes into account pitch changes between stanzas and tempo variations. To evaluate which candidate beginnings represent the actual boundaries between stanzas, a scoring function is defined based on the calculated similarities between stanzas. A peak picking method is used in combination with global thresholding for the final selection of stanza boundaries. The presented method was tested and evaluated on a collection of Slovenian folk songs from EthnoMuse archive.",SVN,education,Developed economies,"[-18.848148, -10.15204]","[-5.0826097, 4.967185]","[-8.598882, -5.9806423, -14.241538]","[-3.863476, -4.5699816, -13.792043]","[12.188799, 11.045523]","[4.466794, 4.396207]","[15.617068, 8.572108, 0.33471802]","[5.5007463, 10.492998, 14.264085]"

But for a specific audio version of a given piece of music, the novelty detection result may also crucially depend on the individual performance style of the musician. This particularly holds true for tempo-related properties, which may vary significantly across different performances of the same piece of music. In this paper, we show that tempo-based novelty detection can be stabilized and improved by simultaneously analyzing a set of different performances. We first warp the version-dependent novelty curves onto a common musical time axis, and then combine the individual curves to produce a single fusion curve. Our hypothesis is that musically relevant points of novelty tend to be consistent across different performances.

Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) has been recently employed to this problem producing very successful results. The method decomposes the signal into a low-rank component corresponding to the accompaniment with its repetitive structure, and a sparse component corresponding to the voice with its quasi-harmonic structure. In this paper we first introduce a non-negative variant of RPCA, termed as robust low-rank non-negative matrix factorization (RNMF). This new framework better suits audio applications. We then propose two efficient feed-forward architectures that approximate the RPCA and RNMF with low latency and a fraction of the complexity of the original optimization method.

The first strategy extracts the f0 from salient pitch contours computed from the mixed spectrum; the second separates the voice from the guitar and then performs monophonic f0 estimation. We integrate both approaches with an automatic transcription system, which first estimates the tuning frequency and then implements an iterative strategy for note segmentation and labeling. We evaluate them on a flamenco music collection, including a wide range of singers and recording conditions. Both strategies achieve satisfying results. The separation-based approach yields a good overall accuracy (76.81%), although instrumental segments have to be manually located. The predominant f0 estimator yields slightly higher accuracy (79.72%) but does not require any manual annotation. Furthermore, its accuracy increases (84.68%) if we adapt some algorithm parameters to each analyzed excerpt. Most transcription errors are due to incorrect f0 estimations (typically octave and voicing errors in strong presence of guitar) and incorrect note segmentation in highly ornamented sections.

The use of signal enhancement as a pre-processing step has led to limited improvement though, because distortions inevitably remain in the enhanced signals that may propagate to the subsequent feature extraction and classification stages. Previous studies attempting to reduce the impact of these distortions have relied on the use of feature weighting or missing feature theory. Based on advances in the field of noise-robust speech recognition, we represent the uncertainty about the enhanced signals via a Gaussian distribution instead that is subsequently propagated to the features and to the classifier. We introduce new methods to estimate the uncertainty from the signal in a fully automatic manner and to learn the classifier directly from polyphonic data.

Recent work has applied this principle to separate the musical background from the vocal foreground in a mixture, by simply extracting the underlying repeating structure. While existing methods are effective, they depend on an assumption of periodically repeating patterns. In this work, we generalize the repetition-based source separation approach to handle cases where repetitions also happen intermittently or without a fixed period, thus allowing the processing of music pieces with fast-varying repeating structures and isolated repeating elements. Instead of looking for periodicities, the proposed method uses a similarity matrix to identify the repeating elements. It then calculates a repeating spectrogram model using the median and extracts the repeating patterns using a time-frequency masking. Evaluation on a data set of 14 full-track real-world pop songs showed that use of a similarity matrix can overall improve on the separation performance compared with a previous repetition-based source separation method, and a recent competitive music/voice separation method, while still being computationally efficient.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[1.7699718, -46.09726]","[-48.78418, -6.095711]","[7.437414, -21.973396, -12.726374]","[-26.128521, -9.716017, -8.706458]","[9.087082, 11.897407]","[1.4894413, 5.60856]","[13.627323, 10.523652, -0.85485864]","[4.949963, 11.586503, 12.145921]"

The presented method is designed for the commonly used grand staff and the approach is extendable to other types of scores. The image processing consists of page segmentation into lines followed by multiple stages that optimally orient the lines and establish a reference grid to be used in the note identification stage. Both the audio and the printed score are converted into compatible frequency representations. Alignment is performed using dynamic time warping with a specially designed distance measure. The insufficient pitch resolution due to the reductive nature of the mid-level representation is compensated by this pitch tolerant distance measure.

However, there has been no systematic analysis regarding how well these evaluation results translate into real-world user satisfaction. For most researchers, reaching statistical significance in the evaluation results is usually the most important goal, but in this paper we show that indicators of statistical significance (i.e., small p-value) are eventually of secondary importance. Researchers who want to predict the real-world implications of formal evaluations should properly report upon practical significance (i.e., large effect-size). Using data from the 18 systems submitted to the MIREX 2011 Audio Music Similarity and Retrieval task, we ran an experiment with 100 real-world users that allows us to explicitly map system performance onto user satisfaction.

Musicological approaches are usually concerned with the description or implementation of man-made music theories. In this paper, we present a quantitative bottom-up approach to the study of rhythm that relies upon well-understood statistical methods from natural language processing. We adapt these methods to our corpus of music, based on the realisation that—unlike words—bar-length drum patterns can be systematically decomposed into sub-patterns both in time and by instrument. We show that, in some respects, our rhythm corpus behaves like natural language corpora, particularly in the sparsity of vocabulary. The same methods that detect word collocations allow us to quantify and rank idiomatic combinations of drum patterns. In other respects, our corpus has properties absent from language corpora, in particular, the high amount of repetition and strong mutual information rates between drum instruments.

To solve this problem, we propose nonparametric Bayesian models based on gamma processes and efficient variational and multiplicative learning algorithms. These infinite CARMs (iCARMs) can discover appropriate numbers of sources and filters in a data-driven manner. We report the experimental results of multipitch analysis on the MAPS piano database.",JPN,facility,Developed economies,"[23.149654, 8.850161]","[-48.76377, 0.26439884]","[1.9514214, -12.868698, 10.1395035]","[-24.018854, -2.3183112, -13.851865]","[9.6576605, 9.660214]","[1.8477129, 5.1178975]","[13.807758, 8.420298, -0.28672326]","[4.72524, 11.651996, 12.644913]"

However, tag descriptions present some drawbacks such as tag scarcity or concept inconsistencies. In these situations, tag recommendation strategies can help users in adding meaningful tags to the resources being described. Freesound is an online audio clip sharing site that uses collaborative tagging to describe a collection of more than 140,000 sound samples. In this paper we propose four algorithm variants for tag recommendation based on tag co-occurrence in the Freesound folksonomy. On the basis of removing a number of tags that have to be later predicted by the algorithms, we find that using ranks instead of raw tag similarities produces statistically significant improvements. Moreover, we show how specific strategies for selecting the appropriate number of tags to be recommended can significantly improve algorithms’ performance. These two aspects provide insight into some of the most basic components of tag recommendation systems, and we plan to exploit them in future real-world deployments.",ESP,education,Developed economies,"[-40.82173, 12.793709]","[50.682697, 11.576728]","[-27.932535, 2.893776, -6.8202395]","[27.793924, 9.855443, -1.9265354]","[14.742163, 10.407652]","[8.030231, 5.8948593]","[17.776094, 8.482928, -1.4555645]","[8.571927, 9.661907, 13.60778]"

Automatic music transcription involves several subproblems that are interdependent of each other: multiple fundamental frequency estimation, onset detection, and rhythm/tempo recognition. In general, simultaneous estimation is preferable when several estimation problems have chicken-and-egg relationships. This paper proposes modeling the generative process of an entire music spectrogram by combining the sub-process by which a musically natural tempo curve is generated, the sub-process by which a set of note onset positions is generated based on a 2-dimensional tree structure representation of music, and the sub-process by which a music spectrogram is generated according to the tempo curve and the note onset positions. Most conventional approaches to music transcription perform note extraction prior to structure analysis, but accurate note extraction has been a difficult task. By contrast, thanks to the combined generative model, the present method performs note extraction and structure estimation simultaneously and thus the optimal solution is obtained within a unified framework.

There are two main contributions of this paper in the rhythm analysis field. Firstly, a novel technique is proposed to code the rhythm periodicity functions of a music signal. Target tempi range is divided into overlapping “tempo bands” and the periodicity function is filtered by triangular masks aligned to those tempo bands, in order to calculate the respective saliencies, followed by the application of the DCT transform on band strengths. The second contribution is the adoption of Support Vector Machines to learn broad tempo classes from the coded periodicity vectors. Training instances are assigned a tempo class according to annotated tempo. The classes are assumed to correspond to “music speed”. At classification phase, each target excerpt is assigned a tempo class label by the SVM. Target periodicity vector is masked by the predicted tempo class range, and tempo is estimated by peak picking in the reduced periodicity vector. The proposed method was evaluated on the benchmark ISMIR 2004 Tempo Induction Evaluation Exchange Dataset for both tempo class and tempo value estimation tasks.

Three types of audio features, namely the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, the chroma features, and the auditory temporal modulations are employed in order to form beat-synchronous feature sequences modeling the audio signal. Assume that the feature vectors from each segment lie in a subspace and the song as a whole occupies the union of several subspaces. Then any feature vector can be represented as a linear combination of the feature vectors stemming from the same subspace. The coefficients of such a linear combination are found by solving an appropriate ridge regression problem, resulting to the ridge representation (RR) of the audio features. The RR yields an affinity matrix with nonzero within-subspace affinities and zero between-subspace ones, revealing the structure of the music recording. The segmentation of the feature sequence into music segments is found by applying the normalized cuts algorithm to the RR-based affinity matrix. In the same context, the combination of multiple audio features is investigated as well. The proposed method is referred to as ridge regression-based music structure analysis (RRMSA).

These features can be engineered or learned from data. Although the former approach was dominant in the past, feature learning has started to receive more attention from the MIR community in recent years. Recent results in feature learning indicate that simple algorithms such as K-means can be very effective, sometimes surpassing more complicated approaches based on restricted Boltzmann machines, autoencoders or sparse coding. Furthermore, there has been increased interest in multiscale representations of music audio recently.

Melody, rhythm, and harmony provide the primary triggers, but what about timbre? Do the musical instruments have underlying emotional characters? For example, is the well-known melancholy sound of the English horn due to its timbre or to how composers use it? Though music emotion recognition has received a lot of attention, researchers have only recently begun considering the relationship between emotion and timbre. To this end, we devised a listening test to compare representative tones from eight different wind and string instruments. The goal was to determine if some tones were consistently perceived as being happier or sadder in pairwise comparisons. A total of eight emotions were tested in the study. The results showed strong underlying emotional characters for each instrument. The emotions Happy, Joyful, Heroic, and Comic were strongly correlated with one another. The violin, trumpet, and clarinet best represented these emotions. Sad and Depressed were also strongly correlated. These two emotions were best represented by the horn and flute. Scary was the emotional outlier of the group, while the oboe had the most emotionally neutral timbre. Also, we found that emotional judgment correlates significantly with average spectral centroid for the more distinctive emotions, including Happy, Joyful, Sad, Depressed, and Shy.

Based on this observation, one can separate singing voice from the background music. However, the quality of such separation might be limited, because the vocal part of a song can sometimes be low-rank as well. Therefore, we propose to learn the subspace structures of vocal and instrumental sounds from a collection of clean signals first, and then compute the low-rank representations of both the vocal and instrumental parts of a song based on the learned subspaces. Specifically, we use online dictionary learning to learn the subspaces, and propose a new algorithm called multiple low-rank representation (MLRR) to decompose a magnitude spectrogram into two low-rank matrices. Our approach is flexible in that the subspaces of singing voice and music accompaniment are both learned from data. Evaluation on the MIR-1K dataset shows that the approach improves the source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) and the source-to-interference ratio (SIR), but not the source-to-artifact ratio (SAR).",TWN,facility,Developing economies,"[-8.201293, -41.39986]","[-53.622944, -2.72768]","[14.026487, -16.31814, -23.400051]","[-29.059614, 1.3378457, -7.7819595]","[10.5793705, 12.315506]","[1.5851289, 5.363553]","[14.918609, 10.188595, -0.1388822]","[4.8292103, 11.8277235, 12.198118]"

Melody in Carnatic music is based on the concept of raga. Melodic motifs are signature phrases which give a raga its identity. They are also the fundamental units that enable extempore elaborations of a raga. In this paper, an attempt is made to spot typical melodic motifs of a raga queried in a musical piece using a two pass dynamic programming approach, with pitch as the basic feature. In the first pass, the rough longest common subsequence (RLCS) matching is performed between the saddle points of the pitch contours of the reference motif and the musical piece. These saddle points corresponding to quasi-stationary points of the motifs, are relevant entities of the raga. Multiple sequences are identified in this step, not all of which correspond to the motif that is queried. To reduce the false alarms, in the second pass a fine search using RLCS is performed between the continuous pitch contours of the reference motif and the subsequences obtained in the first pass. The proposed methodology is validated by testing on Alapanas of 20 different musicians.",IND,education,Developing economies,"[-14.0968485, -21.895887]","[0.4351422, 19.391525]","[4.864778, 2.3417137, -16.318027]","[2.6546307, 12.04764, -10.119879]","[11.351511, 11.2546425]","[4.6519585, 3.5123487]","[15.202199, 8.402955, 1.1800977]","[4.824239, 9.540358, 15.086624]"

Since manual annotation of PAT for analysis is both time-consuming and impractical for real-time applications, automatic transcription is desirable. However, computational methods for onset detection in audio signals are conventionally measured against PhOT or POT data. This paper describes a comparison between PAT and onset detection data to assess whether in some circumstances they are similar enough to be equivalent, or whether additional models for PAT-PhOT difference are always necessary. Eight published onset algorithms, and one commercial system, were tested with five onset types in short monophonic sequences. Ground truth was established by multiple human transcription of the audio for PATs using rhythm adjustment with synchronous presentation, and parameters for each detection algorithm manually adjusted to produce the maximum agreement with the ground truth. Results indicate that for percussive attacks, a number of algorithms produce data close to or within the limits of human agreement and therefore may be substituted for PATs, while for non-percussive sounds corrective measures are necessary to match detector outputs to human estimates.",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[26.668709, -29.515137]","[-24.992643, 27.797638]","[20.92224, 1.2617517, -2.712952]","[-9.219521, -9.998053, -6.2603416]","[8.836301, 6.699392]","[2.5207927, 4.0097485]","[12.11563, 7.082365, -1.6429336]","[3.2418258, 10.337896, 13.363649]"

In order to find better local minima, we propose to extend an existing PLCA-based transcription method with the deterministic annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm. The PLCA update rules are modified by introducing a “temperature” parameter. At higher temperatures, general areas of the search space containing good solutions are found. As the temperature is gradually decreased, distinctions in the data are sharpened, resulting in a more fine-grained optimisation at each successive temperature. This process reduces the dependence on the initialisation, which is otherwise a limitation of NMF and PLCA approaches. The method was tested on two standard multi-instrument transcription data sets (MIREX and Bach10). Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art reference method, according to both frame-based and note-based metrics.

On one side, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning allow to benefit from the availability of larger sets of training data, even if not fully annotated with class labels, and of larger sets of diverse feature representations, through novel dimensionality reduction schemes. On the other side, ensemble methods allow to benefit from more diversity in base learners though larger data and feature sets. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble learning approach making use of recent non-linear dimensionality reduction methods. More precisely, we apply t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to a large feature set to come up with embeddings of various dimensionality. A k-NN classifier is then obtained for each embedding, leading to an ensemble whose estimates can then be combined, making use of various ensemble combination rules from the literature.

We evaluate the approach on a transductive audio classification task, where only part of the whole data set is labeled.

The study focuses on the relevance of gestural (e.g. visual, breath) cues in achieving note onset synchrony in a violin and cello duo, in which musicians must fulfill a mutual conducting role. The musicians performed two pieces – one with long notes separated by long pauses, another with long notes but no pauses – under direct, partial (silhouettes), and no line of sight. Analysis of the musicians’ note synchrony shows that visual contact significantly impacts synchronization in the first piece, but not significantly in the second piece, leading to the hypothesis that opportunities to shape notes may provide further cues for synchronization. The results also show that breath cues are important, and that the relative positions of these cues impact note asynchrony at the ends of pauses; thus, the advance timing information provided by breath cues could form a basis for generating virtual cues in distributed performance, where network latency delays sonic and visual cues. This study demonstrates the need to account for structure (e.g. pauses, long notes) and prosodic gestures in ensemble synchronisation.",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[28.83425, -8.882254]","[-28.877665, 16.758966]","[24.007126, 12.248834, 3.8253393]","[-0.56601626, -24.532228, -13.262195]","[9.840897, 6.9699416]","[3.013075, 2.8238025]","[13.161336, 6.3853955, -1.2012066]","[3.332329, 9.135404, 13.753472]"

The component spectrograms are typically estimated using a Wiener filter that reuses the phase of the mixture spectrogram, but such rough phase reconstruction makes it hard to recover high-quality source signals because the estimated spectrograms are inconsistent, i.e., they do not correspond to any real time-domain signals. To avoid the frequency-domain phase reconstruction, we use positive semidefinite tensor factorization (PSDTF) for directly estimating source signals from the mixture signal in the time domain.

But in many cases individual source audio is not available for training. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel scheme using semi-supervised PLCA with probabilistic graph clustering, which does not require individual sources for training. The PLCA is based on source-filter approach which models the spectral envelope as a weighted sum of elementary band-pass filters. The novel graph based approach, embedded in the PLCA framework, takes into account various perceptual cues for characterizing a source.

This paper presents two methods to evaluate feature importance, in which we compared nine available features based on a large user log in the real world. The set of features includes song metadata, acoustic feature, and user preference used by Collaborative Filtering techniques. The evaluation methods are designed from two views: i) the correlation between the estimated scores by song similarity in respect of a feature and the scores estimated by real play count, ii) feature selection methods over a binary classification problem, i.e., “like” or “dislike”. The experimental results show the user preference is the most important feature and artist similarity is of the second importance among these nine features.""",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-19.690289, 11.407938]","[46.59783, 16.85602]","[-0.5240706, 7.814788, -7.4335337]","[25.390596, 2.3221478, -1.8921918]","[13.37069, 9.128574]","[8.68228, 4.917545]","[16.310072, 7.8362675, -1.5361918]","[8.984882, 9.192506, 14.65231]"

This has complicated research into the large surviving corpus of lute music, notated exclusively in tablature. A solution may be found in automatic transcription, of which voice separation is a necessary step. During the last decade, several methods for separating voices in symbolic polyphonic music formats have been developed. However, all but two of these methods adopt a rule-based approach; moreover, none of them is designed for tablature. Our method differs on both these points. First, rather than using fixed rules, we use a model that learns from data: a neural network that predicts voice assignments for notes. Second, our method is specifically designed for tablature—tablature information is included in the features used as input for the models—but it can also be applied to other music corpora. We have experimented on a dataset containing tablature pieces of different polyphonic textures, and compare the results against those obtained from a baseline hidden Markov model (HMM) model. Additionally, we have performed a preliminary comparison of the neural network model with several existing methods for voice separation on a small dataset.

One promising class of methods to accomplish this task is based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Such methods, however, are still far from perfect. Distinct pitches from a single instrument have similar timbre, similar note attacks, and contain overlapping harmonics that all make separation difficult. In an attempt to overcome these issues, we use a database of synthesized piano and guitar recordings to learn the harmonic structure of distinct pitches, perform NMF-based separation, and then extend the method to allow an end-user to interactively correct for errors in the output separation estimates by drawing on a piano roll display of the separated tracks. The user-annotations are mapped to linear grouping regularization parameters within a modified NMF-based algorithm and are then used to refine the separation estimates in an iterative manner. For evaluation, a prototype user-interface was built and used to separate several polyphonic guitar and piano recordings.

For example, audio is degraded by low-quality microphones, noisy recording environments, MP3 compression, dynamic compression in broadcasting or vinyl decay. In spite of this, no standard software for the degradation of audio exists, and music processing methods are usually evaluated against clean data. The ADT fills this gap by providing Matlab scripts that emulate a wide range of degradation types. We describe 14 degradation units, and how they can be chained to create more complex, ‘real-world’ degradations. The ADT also provides functionality to adjust existing ground-truth, correcting for temporal distortions introduced by degradation.

In the latter case the note durations in the query are taken into account, but some time jittering is allowed for. When dealing with audio, these are important properties because the number of possible note events is large and the note positions are not exact.

Many music/voice separation techniques tend to focus on modeling one source; the residual is then used to explain the other source. In such cases, separation performance is often unsatisfactory for the source that has not been explicitly modeled. In this work, we propose to combine a method that explicitly models singing voice with a method that explicitly models background music, to address separation performance from the point of view of both sources. One method learns a singer-independent model of voice from singing examples using a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) based technique, while the other method derives a model of music by identifying and extracting repeating patterns using a similarity matrix and a median filter. Since the model of voice is singer-independent and the model of music does not require training data, the proposed method does not require training data from a user, once deployed. Evaluation on a data set of 1,000 song clips showed that combining modeling of both sources can improve separation performance, when compared with modeling only one of the sources, and also compared with two other state-of-the-art methods.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[1.20002, -44.520332]","[-51.74287, -5.5006733]","[6.5994234, -19.576265, -13.637235]","[-28.53297, -1.7935364, -7.0098076]","[9.39002, 12.065109]","[1.4174998, 5.5550213]","[13.83894, 10.62864, -0.5712776]","[4.7971153, 11.757705, 12.090242]"

Indian classical music has a definite hierarchical structure where macro level concepts like thaats and raga are defined in terms of micro entities like swaras and shrutis. Swaras or notes in Indian music are defined only in terms of their relation to one another (akin to the movable do-re-mi-fa system), and an inference must be made from patterns of sounds, rather than their absolute frequency structure. We have developed methods to perform scale-independent raga identification using a random forest classifier on swara histograms and achieved state-of-the-art results for the same. The approach is robust as it directly works on partly noisy raga recordings from Youtube videos without knowledge of the scale used, whereas previous work in this direction often use audios generated in a controlled environment with the desired scale.

In a traditional supervised machine learning setting, a system can only use labeled data from a single dataset to solve a given task. The labels associated with the dataset define the nature of the task to solve. A key advantage of transfer learning is in leveraging knowledge from related tasks to improve performance on a given target task. One way to transfer knowledge is to learn a shared latent representation across related tasks. This method has shown to be beneficial in many domains of machine learning, but has yet to be explored in MIR. Many MIR datasets for audio classification present a semantic overlap in their labels. Furthermore, these datasets often contain relatively few songs. Thus, there is a strong case for exploring methods to share knowledge between these datasets towards a more general and robust understanding of high level musical concepts such as genre and similarity.

Given a user-specified input song, the system first identifies the phrase-level structure and then estimates the “mashability” between each phrase section of the input and songs in the user’s music collection. Mashability is calculated based on the harmonic similarity between beat synchronous chromagrams over a user-definable range of allowable key shifts and tempi. Once a match in the collection for a given section of the input song has been found, a pitch-shifting and time-stretching algorithm is used to harmonically and temporally align the sections, after which the loudness of the transformed section is modified to ensure a balanced mix. AutoMashUpper has a user interface to allow visualisation and manipulation of mashups. When creating a mashup, users can specify a list of songs to choose from, modify the mashability parameters and change the granularity of the phrase segmentation. Once created, users can also switch, add, or remove sections from the mashup to suit their taste. In this way, AutoMashUpper can assist users to actively create new music content by enabling and encouraging them to explore the mashup space.",JPN,facility,Developed economies,"[3.3170853, 40.52231]","[-5.859987, 30.868504]","[-0.6681461, 33.7676, -3.089588]","[15.592254, 25.153564, -2.758901]","[9.699807, 7.2295513]","[7.0700727, 4.672273]","[13.577981, 6.3807015, -1.1872709]","[5.7607613, 8.72573, 12.645892]"

Typically, the first movements of symphonies and sonatas follow the sonata form, which (in its most basic form) starts with an exposition and a repetition thereof, continues with a development, and closes with a recapitulation. The recapitulation can be regarded as an altered repeat of the exposition, where certain substructures (first and second subject groups) appear in musically modified forms. In this paper, we introduce automated methods for analyzing music recordings in sonata form, where we proceed in two steps. In the first step, we derive the coarse structure by exploiting that the recapitulation is a kind of repetition of the exposition. This requires audio structure analysis tools that are invariant under local modulations. In the second step, we identify finer substructures by capturing relative modulations between the subject groups in exposition and recapitulation. We evaluate and discuss our results by means of the Beethoven piano sonatas.

The most common alignment method, dynamic time warping (DTW), cannot handle structural differences adequately, and existing approaches to deal with structural differences explicitly rely on the annotation of “break points” in one of the sequences. We propose a simple extension of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to deal effectively with structural differences, without relying on annotations. We evaluate several audio features for alignment, and show how an optimal value can be found for the cost-parameter of the alignment algorithm. A single cost value is demonstrated to be valid across different types of music.

We build the semantic layer using two large-scale data sets – crowd-sourced tags from Last.fm, and editorial annotations from the I Like Music (ILM) production music corpus – and use subsets of these corpora to train SLP for mapping audio features to the semantic layer. The performance of the system is assessed in predicting mood ratings on continuous scales in the two data sets mentioned above.

In this paper, we present two methodologies for the identification of the tonic in audio recordings of makam music of Turkey, both taking advantage of some score information. First, we compute a prominent pitch and a audio kernel-density pitch class distribution (KPCD) from the audio recording. The peaks in the KPCD are selected as tonic candidates. The first method computes a score KPCD from the monophonic melody extracted from the score. Then, the audio KPCD is circular-shifted with respect to each tonic candidate and compared with the score KPCD. The best matching shift indicates the estimated tonic. The second method extracts the monophonic melody of the most repetitive section of the score. Normalising the audio prominent pitch with respect to each tonic candidate, the method attempts to link the repetitive structural element given in the score with the respective time-intervals in the audio recording. The result producing the most confident links marks the estimated tonic. We have tested the methods on a dataset of makam music of Turkey, achieving a very high accuracy (94.9%) with the first method, and almost perfect identification (99.6%) with the second method.

A good illustrative genre is flamenco, which employs not only regular but also irregular hypermetrical structures that rapidly switch between 3/4 and 6/8 mediocompas blocks. Moreover, typical flamenco idioms employ heavy syncopation and sudden, misleading off-beat accents and patterns, while often elliding the downbeat accents that humans as well as existing meter-finding algorithms rely on, thus creating a high degree of listener “surprise” that makes not only the structural relations, but even the metrical structure itself, elusive to learn. Flamenco musicians rely on both complex regular hypermetrical knowledge as well as irregular real-time clues to recognize when to switch meters and patterns. Our new approach envisions this as an integrated problem of learning a bilingual transduction, i.e., a structural relation between two languages—where there are different musical languages of, say, flamenco percussion versus zapateado footwork or palmas hand clapping. We apply minimum description length criteria to induce transduction grammars that simultaneously learn (1) the multiple metrical structures, (2) the hypermetrical structure that stochastically governs meter switching, and (3) the probabilistic transduction relationship between patterns of different rhythmic languages that enables musicians to predict when to switch meters and how to select patterns depending on what fellow musicians are generating.",HKG,education,Developing economies,"[-19.974318, -22.212225]","[-7.7459865, -37.227318]","[-0.25025862, -8.22347, -21.591928]","[-8.92532, -25.843386, -3.5495248]","[11.168125, 11.140189]","[2.5077412, 3.3979254]","[15.361872, 9.096512, 0.3279757]","[3.3668077, 9.618442, 13.399641]"

One proposed solution is music prediction, wherein musical events are predicted in advance and transmitted to distributed musicians ahead of the network delay. We present a context-aware music prediction system focusing on expressive timing: a Bayesian network that incorporates stylistic model selection and linear conditional gaussian distributions on variables representing proportional tempo change. The system can be trained using rehearsals of distributed or co-located ensembles. We evaluate the model by comparing its prediction accuracy to two others: one employing only linear conditional dependencies between expressive timing nodes but no stylistic clustering, and one using only independent distributions for timing changes. The three models are tested on performances of a custom-composed piece that is played ten times, each in one of two styles. The results are promising, with the proposed system outperforming the other two. In predictable parts of the performance, the system with conditional dependencies and stylistic clustering achieves errors of 15ms; in more difficult sections, the errors rise to 100ms; and, in unpredictable sections, the error is too great for seamless timing emulation.

However, despite a large body of work in audio beat tracking, there is currently no consensus over which evaluation measure(s) to use, meaning multiple accuracy scores are typically reported. In this paper, we seek to evaluate the evaluation measures by examining the relationship between objective accuracy scores and human judgements of beat tracking performance. First, we present the raw correlation between objective scores and subjective ratings, and show that evaluation measures which allow alternative metrical levels appear more correlated than those which do not.

Furthermore, depending on the parameter settings, one often can observe a leakage of harmonic sounds into the percussive component and vice versa.

Since conventional lyrics retrieval systems are based on simple word search, those systems often fail to reflect user’s intention behind a query when a word given as a query can be used in different contexts. For example, the word “tears” can appear not only in sad songs (e.g., feel heartrending), but also in happy songs (e.g., weep for joy). To overcome this limitation, we propose to automatically analyze and visualize topics of lyrics by using a well-known text analysis method called latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). This enables LyricsRadar to offer two types of topic visualization. One is the topic radar chart that visualizes the relative weights of five latent topics of each song on a pentagon-shaped chart. The other is radar-like arrangement of all songs in a two-dimensional space in which song lyrics having similar topics are arranged close to each other.

Performance falls off for all submissions as the vocabularies increase in complexity, but does it do so directly in proportion to the number of more complex chords, or are certain algorithms indeed more robust? What are the outliers, song-algorithm pairs where the performance was substantially higher or lower than would be predicted, and how can they be explained?

The main goal is to motivate MER researchers to develop an improved class of systems capable of overcoming the limitations of the BOF approach and coping with the inherent complexity of musical emotions.",PRT,facility,Developed economies,"[-60.1019, 2.3973086]","[43.110516, -27.265366]","[-26.75872, 10.708796, -20.588251]","[16.460423, 16.046597, 10.41596]","[15.668074, 12.074979]","[9.379821, 7.0419145]","[18.453512, 10.04159, 0.42592698]","[9.313391, 8.552912, 12.114411]"

Using this approach, the likelihood function based on NMF is represented by a Poisson distribution and the NMF parameters, consisting of basis and weight matrices, are characterized by the exponential priors. A variational Bayesian expectation-maximization algorithm is developed to learn variational parameters and model parameters for monaural source separation. A clustering algorithm is performed to establish two groups of bases: one is for singing voice and the other is for background music. Model complexity is controlled by adaptively selecting the number of bases for different mixed signals according to the variational lower bound. Model regularization is tackled through the uncertainty modeling via variational inference based on marginal likelihood.

This paper addresses the specific hypothesis whether temporal information is essential for predicting expressed emotions in music, as a prototypical example of a cognitive aspect of music. We propose to test this hypothesis using a novel processing pipeline: 1) Extracting audio features for each track resulting in a multivariate ""feature time series"". 2) Using generative models to represent these time series (acquiring a complete track representation). Specifically, we explore the Gaussian Mixture model, Vector Quantization, Autoregressive model, Markov and Hidden Markov models. 3) Utilizing the generative models in a discriminative setting by selecting the Probability Product Kernel as the natural kernel for all considered track representations. We evaluate the representations using a kernel based model specifically extended to support the robust two-alternative forced choice self-report paradigm, used for eliciting expressed emotions in music.

The incompleteness of data can hamper some important tasks, such as music and artist recommendation. In this scenario, transductive classification can be used to classify the whole dataset considering just few labeled instances. Usually transductive classification is performed through label propagation, in which data are represented as networks and the examples propagate their labels through their connections. Similarity-based networks are usually applied to model data as network. However, this kind of representation requires the definition of parameters, which significantly affect the classification accuracy, and presents a high cost due to the computation of similarities among all dataset instances. In contrast, bipartite heterogeneous networks have appeared as an alternative to similarity-based networks in text mining applications. In these networks, the words are connected to the documents which they occur. Thus, there is no parameter or additional costs to generate such networks. In this paper, we propose the use of the bipartite network representation to perform transductive classification of music, using a bag-of-frames approach to describe music signals.

The resulting model is tested by predicting note velocity for unseen performances. Our approach differs from earlier work in a number of ways: (1) an additional input representation based on a local history of velocity values is used, (2) the RBMs are trained to result in a network with sparse activations, (3) network connectivity is increased by adding skip-connections, and (4) more data is used for training.

At the front end, it automatically detects the singer’s formant according to the Long-Term Average Spectrum (LTAS). This detection function is also applied to the short-term spectrum in each frame to determine the melody. The Fan Chirp Transform (FChT) [4] is used to compute pitch salience as its high time-frequency resolution overcomes the difficulties introduced by vibrato. Subharmonic attenuation is adopted to handle octave errors which are common in opera vocals. We improve the FChT algorithm so that it is capable of correcting outliers in pitch detection.

Singer specific dictionaries learned from available polyphonic recordings provide the soft mask that effectively attenuates the bleeding-through of accompanying melodic instruments typical of purely harmonic-sinusoidal model based separation. The dictionary learning uses NMF optimization across a training set of mixed signal utterances while keeping the vocal signal bases constant across the utterances.

We present a keyword spotting approach based on keyword-filler Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and test it on a-capella singing and spoken lyrics. We test Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Perceptual Linear Predictive Features (PLPs), and Temporal Patterns (TRAPs) as front ends. These features are then used to generate phoneme posteriors using Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on speech data. The phoneme posteriors are then used as the system input. Our approach produces useful results on a-capella singing, but depend heavily on the chosen keyword. We show that results can be further improved by training the MLP on a-capella data.

The “phrase” in this paper means a short audio excerpt that is not limited to a main melody (singing part) and is usually played by a single musical instrument. A main problem of this task is that the query is often buried in mixture signals consisting of various instruments. To solve this problem, we propose a method that can appropriately calculate the distance between a query and partial components of a musical piece. More specifically, gamma process nonnegative matrix factorization (GaP-NMF) is used for decomposing the spectrogram of the query into an appropriate number of basis spectra and their activation patterns.

The method extends the systematic segmentation and representation of Sapp’s ‘keyscapes’ to the description stage, by introducing a set-class level of description. This provides a systematic, mid-level, and standard analytical lexicon, which allows the description of any notated music based on fixed temperaments. The method benefits from the representation completeness, the compromise between generalisation and discrimination of the set-class spaces, and the access to hierarchical inclusion relations over time. The proposed class-matrices are multidimensional time series encoding the pitch content of every possible music segment over time, regardless the involved time-scales, in terms of a given set-class space. They provide the simplest information mining methods with the ability of capturing sophisticated tonal relations. The proposed class-vectors, quantifying the presence of every possible set-class in a piece, are discussed for advanced explorations of corpora. The compromise between dimensionality and informativeness provided by the class-matrices and class-vectors, is discussed in relation with standard content-based tonal descriptors, and music information retrieval applications.",ESP,education,Developed economies,"[15.993779, 33.359615]","[9.919771, 0.8108868]","[-14.231644, 1.5935122, 27.07439]","[0.5681959, -0.47501013, 2.3676512]","[11.494062, 7.904955]","[5.5087714, 4.97902]","[14.613082, 7.261233, -0.2233216]","[5.918564, 10.007127, 13.946553]"

Without such data sets, it is difficult to empirically study the patterns that arise in analyses or rigorously evaluate the performance of intelligent systems for this kind of analysis. To combat this, we introduce the first publicly available large-scale data set of computer-processable Schenkerian analyses. We discuss the choice of musical selections in the data set, the encoding of the music and the corresponding ground-truth analyses, and the possible uses of these data.

Firstly, the model learns an organization of musical material from different keys that conveys the topology of the circle of fifths (CoF). Although such a topology can be learned using principal component analysis (PCA) when using pitch-only representations, we found that using a pitch-duration representation impedes the extraction of the CoF topology much more for PCA than for the RBM.

We combine these two approaches by classifying bar-level drum patterns on sub-beat quantised timbre features using support vector machines. We train the classifier using synthesised audio and carry out a series of experiments to evaluate our approach. Using six different drum kits, we show that the classifier generalises to previously unseen drum kits when trained on the other five (80% accuracy). Measures of precision and recall show that even for incorrectly classified patterns many individual drum events are correctly transcribed. Tests on 14 acoustic performances from the ENST-Drums dataset indicate that the system generalises to real-world recordings.

Preliminary note-level transcription achieved by connecting pitch estimates into notes often lead to many spurious notes due to MPE errors.

Each sample is a subset of all notes and is viewed as a note-level transcription candidate. We evaluate the likelihood of each candidate using the MPE model, and select the one with the highest likelihood as the final transcription. The likelihood treats notes in a transcription as a whole and favors transcriptions with less spurious notes. Experiments conducted on 110 pieces of J.S.

Conventionally, dynamic time warping (DTW) and left-to-right hidden Markov models (HMMs) have often been used for audio-to-audio alignment based on a shallow acoustic similarity between performances. Those methods, however, cannot distinguish latent musical structures common to all performances and temporal dynamics unique to each performance. To solve this problem, our model explicitly represents two state sequences: a top-level sequence that determines the common structure inherent in the music itself and a bottom-level sequence that determines the actual temporal fluctuation of each performance. These two sequences are fused into a hierarchical Bayesian HMM and can be learned at the same time from the given performances. Since the top-level sequence assigns the same state for note combinations that repeatedly appear within a piece of music, we can unveil the latent structure of the piece. Moreover, we can easily compare different performances of the same piece by analyzing the bottom-level sequences.

Furthermore, the obtained Linear Prediction Coefficients (LPCs) were mapped to LPC cepstrum coefficients, on which liftering was applied, to boost the timbre invariance of the resultant feature: Modified Perceptual Linear Prediction Liftered Cepstrum (MPLPLC). Experimental results showed that both LPC cepstrum coefficients mapping and cepstrum liftering were crucial in ensuring the identification power of the MPLPLC feature. The MPLPLC feature outperformed state-of-the-art features in the context of CSI and in resisting instrumental accompaniment variation.

Both the LTM and the STM learn regularities in pitch sequences solely from data. The models are combined in an ensemble, wherein they are weighted by the relative entropies of their respective predictions. Going by previous work that demonstrates the success of Connectionist LTMs, we employ the recently proposed Recurrent Temporal Discriminative Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RTDRBM) as the LTM here. While it is indeed possible for the same model to also serve as an STM, our experiments showed that n-gram models tended to learn faster than the RTDRBM in an online setting and that the hybrid of an RTDRBM LTM and an n-gram STM gives us the best predictive performance yet on a corpus of monophonic chorale and folk melodies.",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[-12.166126, -14.61445]","[-14.856393, -29.831032]","[-4.691553, -5.1375704, -15.136565]","[-16.08053, 11.749764, 3.1523285]","[11.272696, 10.842418]","[4.1361747, 7.3709846]","[14.972089, 8.606348, 1.0214555]","[4.8128886, 8.986674, 11.548706]"

For every r¯aga, a set of cohorts are chosen. A r¯aga and its cohorts are represented using pallavi lines of compositions. A novel approach for matching, called Longest Common Segment Set (LCSS), is introduced. The LCSS scores for a r¯aga are then normalized with respect to its cohorts in two different ways.

Equivalent onset refers to the hidden onset that can functionally replace the onsets of the notes in a chord; onset span refers to the time interval from the first note onset to the last note onset. We ask two research questions. First, what is the equivalent onset of a rolled chord? Second, are the onset spans of different chords interpreted in the same way?

This classifier is then used to predict likelihoods for a track’s extracted contours, and these scores are decoded to generate a single melody output.

Using computational methods, this paper provides an overview on the use of rhythmical patterns of the ragtime genre, thereby offering valuable new insights that complement musicological hypotheses about this genre. Specifically, we measure the amount of syncopation for each bar using Longuet-Higgins and Lee’s model of syncopation, determine the most frequent rhythmic patterns, and discuss the role of a specific short-long-short syncopation pattern that musicologists argue is characteristic for ragtime. A comparison between the ragtime (pre-1920) and modern (post-1920) era shows that the two eras differ in syncopation pattern use. Onset density and amount of syncopation increase after 1920. Moreover, our study confirms the musicological hypothesis on the important role of the short-long-short syncopation pattern in ragtime.

When the pedal is pressed, notes played will continue to sound until the string vibration naturally ceases. This makes the notes longer than their notated lengths and overlap with later notes. In this paper, we propose an approach to address this problem. Given that the most competitive wrong score positions for each audio frame are the ones before the correct position due to the sustained sounds, we remove partials of sustained notes and only retain partials of “new notes” in the audio representation. This operation reduces sustain-pedal effects by weakening the match between the audio frame and previous wrong score positions, hence encourages the system to align to the correct score position. We implement this idea based on a state-of-the-art score following framework.

We further obtain two higher level classifiers based on chroma features: one based on comparing histograms of quantized chroma features, and a second one based on computing cross-correlations between sequences of chroma features, to account for temporal information. For combining the latter chroma-based classifiers with the composite classifier based on global features, we use standard rank aggregation methods adapted from the information retrieval literature. We evaluate performance with the Second Hand Song dataset, where we quantify performance using multiple statistics.

To better control this decomposition, NMF has been extended using prior knowledge and parametric models. In fact, using score information considerably improved separation results. Nevertheless, one of the main problems of using score information is the misalignment between the score and the actual performance. A potential solution to this problem is the use of audio to score alignment systems. However, most of them rely on a tolerance window that clearly affects the separation results. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method to refine the aligned score at note level by detecting both, onset and offset for each note present in the score. Note refinement is achieved by detecting shapes and contours in the estimated instrument-wise time activation (gains) matrix. Decomposition is performed in a supervised way, using training instrument models and coarsely-aligned score information. The detected contours define time-frequency note boundaries, and they increase the sparsity.

The GCT allows the re-arrangement of the notes of a harmonic sonority such that abstract idiom-specific types of chords may be derived. This encoding is inspired by the standard roman numeral chord type labelling and is, therefore, ideal for hierarchic harmonic systems such as the tonal system and its many variations; at the same time, it adjusts to any other harmonic system such as post-tonal, atonal music, or traditional polyphonic systems. In this paper the descriptive potential of the GCT is assessed in the tonal idiom by comparing GCT harmonic labels with human expert annotations (Kostka & Payne harmonic dataset). Additionally, novel methods for grouping and clustering chords, according to their GCT encoding and their functional role in chord sequences, are introduced.

We argue that it is more natural from the listener’s point of view to regard emotional variation in music as a progression of emotionally stable segments. In order to enable such tracking of emotion over time it is necessary to segment music at the emotional boundaries. To address this problem we conduct a formal evaluation of different segmentation methods as applied to a task of emotional boundary detection. We collect emotional boundary annotations from three annotators for 52 musical pieces from the RWC music collection that already have structural annotations from the SALAMI dataset. We investigate how well structural segmentation explains emotional segmentation and find that there is a large overlap, though about a quarter of emotional boundaries do not coincide with structural ones. We also study inter-annotator agreement on emotional segmentation.

We propose an abstraction process and a complexity weighting scheme which improve melodic similarity by exploiting specific melodic characteristics in this music. In addition, we propose a tetrachord normalization to handle transposed phrase occurrences. The melodic abstraction is based on the partial transcription of the steady regions in the melody, followed by a duration truncation step. The proposed complexity weighting accounts for the differences in the melodic complexities of the phrases, a crucial aspect known to distinguish phrases in Carnatic music. For evaluation we use over 5 hours of audio data comprising 625 annotated melodic phrases belonging to 10 different phrase categories. Results show that the proposed melodic abstraction and complexity weighting schemes significantly improve the phrase detection accuracy, and that tetrachord normalization is a successful strategy for dealing with transposed phrase occurrences in Carnatic music.

Two recent efforts did exactly this for large-vocabulary ACE, but despite arguably achieving some of the highest results to date, both approaches plateau well short of having solved the problem. Therefore, this work explores the behavior of these two high performing systems as a means of understanding obstacles and limitations in chord estimation, arriving at four critical observations: one, music recordings that invalidate tacit assumptions about harmony and tonality result in erroneous and even misleading performance; two, standard lexicons and comparison methods struggle to reflect the natural relationships between chords; three, conventional approaches conflate the competing goals of recognition and transcription to some undefined degree; and four, the perception of chords in real music can be highly subjective, making the very notion of “ground truth” annotations tenuous.

In this paper, an adaptive auditory filtering based on β-order minimum mean-square error spectral amplitude estimation (bSA) is applied to the kernel additive modeling for improving the singing voice separation performance from monaural music signal. The proposed algorithm is composed of five modules: short time Fourier transform, music/voice separation based on bSA, determination of back-fitting, back-fitting, and inverse short time Fourier transform. In the proposed method, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based factorized spectral amplitude exponent β for each kernel component is adaptively calculated for effective bSA-based auditory filtering performance during kernel back-fitting.

So, besides the suitability between the vertically overlaid tracks (i.e. vertical mashability) used in previous studies, we proposed to further consider the suitability between the horizontally connected consecutive music segments (i.e. horizontal mashability) when searching for proper music segments to be combined. On the vertical side, two new factors: “harmonic change balance” and “volume weight” have been considered. On the horizontal side, the methods used in the studies of medley creation are incorporated.

In this paper, we extend our previous work on feature selection for music genre recognition and focus on so-called “album effect” meaning that optimised classification models may overemphasize relevant characteristics of particular artists and albums rather than learning relevant properties of genres. For that case we examine the performance of classification models on two validation sets after the optimisation with feature selection: the first set with tracks not used for training and feature selection but randomly selected from the same albums, and the second set with tracks selected from other albums. As it can be expected, the classification performance on the second set decreases.

Atkinson+Auckland University>NZL>education,"Musics, like languages and genes, evolve through a process of transmission, variation, and selection. Evolution of musical tune families has been studied qualitatively for over a century, but quantitative analysis has been hampered by an inability to objectively distinguish between musical similarities that are due to chance and those that are due to descent from a common ancestor. Here we propose an automated method to identify tune families by adapting genetic sequence alignment algorithms designed for automatic identification and alignment of protein families. We tested the effectiveness of our method against a high-quality ground-truth dataset of 26 folk tunes from four diverse tune families (two English, two Japanese) that had previously been identified and aligned manually by expert musicologists.

Two sinusoidal models in our earlier work are employed in the above-mentioned system to represent piano tones: the General Model and the Piano Model. The General Model, a variant of sinusoidal modeling, can represent a single tone with high modeling quality, yet it fails to separate mixtures of tones due to the overlapping partials. The Piano Model, on the other hand, is an instrument-specific model tailored for piano. Its modeling quality is lower but it can learn from training data (consisting entirely of isolated tones), resolve the overlapping partials and thus separate the mixtures. We formulate a new hierarchical Bayesian framework to run both Models in the source separation process so that the mixtures with overlapping partials can be separated with high quality.

Conventional HPSS methods have focused on temporal continuity of harmonic components and spectral continuity of percussive components. However, it may not be appropriate to use them to separate time-varying harmonic signals such as vocals, vibratos, and glissandos, as they lack in temporal continuity. Based on the observation that the spectral distributions of harmonic and percussive signals differ – i.e., harmonic components have harmonic and sparse structure while percussive components are broadband – we propose an algorithm that successfully separates the rapidly time-varying harmonic signals from the percussive ones by imposing different constraints on the two groups of spectral bases.

The system creates a variety of blends combining elements of the penultimate chords of two input cadences and it further estimates the expected relationships between the produced blends. Then, a preliminary subjective evaluation of the proposed blending system is presented. A pairwise dissimilarity listening test was conducted using original and blended cadences as stimuli. Subsequent multidimensional scaling analysis produced spatial configurations for both behavioural data and dissimilarity estimations by the algorithm. Comparison of the two configurations showed that the system is capable of making fair predictions of the perceived dissimilarities between the blended cadences.

This paper examines track-day contexts with the purpose of identifying relationships with specific music tracks. Improvements are made to an existing method for classifying Christmas tracks and a generalization to the approach is shown that allows automated discovery of music for any day of the year. Analyzing the top 50 tracks obtained from this method for three well-known holidays, Halloween, Saint Patrick’s Day, and July 4th, precision@50 was 95%, 99%, and 73%, respectively.",USA,company,Developed economies,"[-29.41732, 30.911894]","[41.146854, 12.572734]","[-13.504727, 25.033493, -8.917771]","[15.671916, -14.335263, -4.496618]","[13.985798, 8.758822]","[7.081022, 5.461247]","[16.851238, 7.1357083, -1.4748814]","[7.5317593, 9.835323, 13.490336]"

Evaluating structure analysis as represented by flat annotations effectively discards all notions of structural depth in the evaluation. Although collections of hierarchical structure annotations have been recently published, no techniques yet exist to measure an algorithm’s accuracy against these rich structural annotations.

Content descriptions are explanations of classical music compositions that help a person to understand technical aspects of the music. Recently, Kuribayashi et al. proposed a method for obtaining content descriptions from the web. However, the content descriptions on a single page frequently explain a specific part of a composition only. Therefore, a person who wants to fully understand the composition suffers from a time-consuming task, which seems almost impossible for a novice of classical music.

We noticed that this recognition step can be improved when using singing data in model training, but to our knowledge, there are no large datasets of singing data annotated with phonemes. However, such data does exist for speech. We therefore propose to make phoneme recognition models more robust for singing by training them on speech data that has artificially been made more “song-like”.

This paper addresses the problem of assigning voice leading focussing on the bass voice, i.e., the realisation of the actual bass pitches of an abstract chord sequence, under the scope of a modular melodic harmonisation system where different aspects of the generative process are arranged by different modules. The proposed technique defines the motion of the bass voice according to several statistical aspects: melody voice contour, previous bass line motion, bass-to-melody distances and statistics regarding inversions and note doublings in chords. The aforementioned aspects of voicing are modular, i.e., each criterion is defined by independent statistical learning tools. Experimental results on diverse music idioms indicate that the proposed methodology captures efficiently the voice layout characteristics of each idiom, whilst additional analyses on separate statistically trained modules reveal distinctive aspects of each idiom.

Recent research has explored the explicit modeling of characteristic rhythmic patterns as a way to improve upon existing beat-tracking algorithms, which typically fail on dealing with syncopated or polyrhythmic music. This work takes the Uruguayan Candombe drumming (an afro-rooted rhythm from Latin America) as a case study. After analyzing the aspects that make this music genre troublesome for usual algorithmic approaches and describing its basic rhythmic patterns, the paper proposes a supervised scheme for rhythmic pattern tracking that aims at finding the metric structure from a Candombe recording, including beat and downbeat phases. Then it evaluates and compares the performance of the method with those of general-purpose beat-tracking algorithms through a set of experiments involving a database of annotated recordings totaling over two hours of audio. The results of this work reinforce the advantages of tracking rhythmic patterns (possibly learned from annotated music) when it comes to automatically following complex rhythms.

The algorithm decomposes the music signal into two dictionaries: a percussive dictionary initialized with pre-defined drum templates and a harmonic dictionary initialized with undeﬁned entries. The harmonic dictionary is adapted to the non-percussive music content in a standard NMF procedure. The percussive dictionary is adapted to each individual signal in an iterative scheme: it is fixed during the decomposition process, and is updated based on the result of the previous convergence. Two template adaptation methods are proposed to provide more flexibility and robustness in the case of unknown data. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated and compared to state of the art systems.

The tempo as provided by the tabla together with the rhythmic density of the sitar/sarod plucks serve as the main dimensions that predict the transition between concert sections. We present methods to access the stream of tabla onsets separately from the sitar/sarod onsets, addressing challenges that arise in the instrument separation.

A common strategy is to proceed in a two-step fashion. First, a fundamental frequency (F0) trajectory for the musical voice that is likely to exhibit vibrato is estimated. In a second step, the trajectory is then analyzed with respect to periodic frequency modulations. As a major drawback, however, such a method cannot recover from errors made in the inherently difficult first step, which severely limits the performance during the second step. In this work, we present a novel vibrato analysis approach that avoids the first error-prone F0-estimation step. Our core idea is to perform the analysis directly on a signal’s spectrogram representation where vibrato is evident in the form of characteristic spectro-temporal patterns. We detect and parameterize these patterns by locally comparing the spectrogram with a predefined set of vibrato templates.

In current music creation contexts, it is common for users to search for and use loops shared in online repositories. These loops are typically not produced by professionals and lack annotations.

A popular approach to multipitch analysis is to perform nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for estimating the temporal activations of semitone-level pitches and then execute thresholding for making a piano-roll representation. The major problems of this cascading approach are that an optimal threshold is hard to determine for each musical piece and that musically inappropriate pitch combinations are allowed to appear. To solve these problems, we propose a probabilistic generative model that fuses an acoustic model (NMF) for a music spectrogram with a language model (hidden Markov model; HMM) for pitch locations in a hierarchical Bayesian manner. More specifically, binary variables indicating the existences of pitches are introduced into the framework of NMF. The latent grammatical structures of those variables are regulated by an HMM that encodes chord progressions and pitch co-occurrences (chord components).

A basic assumption of the system is that humans understand rhythm by letting salient periodicities in the music act as a framework, upon which the rhythmical structure is interpreted. Therefore, the system estimates the cepstroid (the most salient periodicity of the music), and uses a neural network that is invariant with regards to the cepstroid length. The input of the network consists mainly of features that capture onset characteristics along time, such as spectral differences. The invariant properties of the network are achieved by subsampling the input vectors with a hop size derived from a musically relevant subdivision of the computed cepstroid of each song. The output is filtered to detect relevant periodicities and then used in conjunction with two additional networks, which estimates the speed and tempo of the music, to predict the final beat positions.

We first align them to the matching textual lyrics using an acoustic model trained on speech. We then use the resulting phoneme alignment to train new acoustic models using only subsets of the DAMP singing data. These models are then tested for phoneme recognition and, on top of that, keyword spotting. Evaluation is performed for different subsets of DAMP and for an unrelated set of the vocal tracks of commercial pop songs.

After automatic pitch- tracking and manual checking of the data, we calculated intonation accuracy and precision, and modelled the note trajectories according to the stimulus types. We modelled pitch error with a linear mixed-effects model, and tested factors for signiﬁcant effects using one-way analysis of variance. The results indicate: (1) Signiﬁcant factors in- clude stimulus type, main pitch, repetition, condition and musical training background, while order of stimuli, gen- der and age do not have any signiﬁcant effect. (2) The ramp, vibrato and tail stimuli have signiﬁcantly greater ab- solute pitch errors than the stable and head stimuli.

Previous attempts at automatically classifying the phonation mode on a dataset containing vowels sung by a female professional have been lacking in accuracy or have not sufficiently investigated the characteristic features of the different phonation modes which enable successful classification. In this paper, we extract a large range of features from this dataset, including specialised descriptors of pressedness and breathiness, to analyse their explanatory power and robustness against changes of pitch and vowel. We train and optimise a feed-forward neural network (NN) with one hidden layer on all features using cross validation to achieve a mean F-measure above 0.85 and an improved performance compared to previous work. Applying feature selection based on mutual information and retaining the nine highest ranked features as input to a NN results in a mean F-measure of 0.78, demonstrating the suitability of these features to discriminate between phonation modes.

Computationally modelling this phenomenon is an open problem, especially when processing expressive shaping of the music such as tempo change. To meet this challenge we propose Adaptive Frequency Neural Networks (AFNNs), an extension of Gradient Frequency Neural Networks (GFNNs). GFNNs are based on neurodynamic models and have been applied successfully to a range of difficult music perception problems including those with syncopated and polyrhythmic stimuli. AFNNs extend GFNNs by applying a Hebbian learning rule to the oscillator frequencies. Thus the frequencies in an AFNN adapt to the stimulus through an attraction to local areas of resonance, and allow for a great dimensionality reduction in the network. Where previous work with GFNNs has focused on frequency and amplitude responses, we also consider phase information as critical for pulse perception. Evaluating the time-based output, we find significantly improved responses of AFNNs compared to GFNNs to stimuli with both steady and varying pulse frequencies. This leads us to believe that AFNNs could replace the linear filtering methods commonly used in beat tracking and tempo estimation systems, and lead to more accurate methods.",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[29.17653, -42.18504]","[-42.146618, 20.407093]","[31.889858, 5.9540067, -3.3954508]","[-14.328424, -17.268505, -4.321728]","[9.213237, 5.9048758]","[1.7849036, 3.530276]","[12.0345125, 6.1991844, -0.7739555]","[2.8682613, 9.798665, 12.6249895]"

To automatically detect these mistakes, a first idea is to use a music transcription method to detect notes played in an audio recording and to compare the results with a corresponding score. However, as the number of transcription errors produced by standard methods is often considerably higher than the number of actual mistakes, the results are often of limited use. In contrast, our method exploits that the score already provides rough information about what we seek to detect in the audio, which allows us to construct a tailored transcription method. In particular, we employ score-informed source separation techniques to learn for each score pitch a set of templates capturing the spectral properties of that pitch. After extrapolating the resulting template dictionary to pitches not in the score, we estimate the activity of each MIDI pitch over time. Finally, making again use of the score, we choose for each pitch an individualized threshold to differentiate note onsets from spurious activity in an optimized way.

One of the best ways to compute this separation, as proposed by Chew and Wu in 2005, is to first identify contigs that are portions of the music score with a constant number of voices, then to progressively connect these contigs. This raises two questions: Which contigs should be connected first? And, how should these two contigs be connected? Here we propose to answer simultaneously these two questions by considering a set of musical features that measures the quality of any connection. The coefficients weighting the features are optimized through a genetic algorithm. We benchmark the resulting connection policy on corpora containing fugues of the Well-Tempered Clavier by J. S.

It is trained to compute chroma features that encode harmonic information important for chord recognition, while being robust to irrelevant interferences. We achieve this by feeding the network an audio spectrum with context instead of a single frame as input. This way, the network can learn to selectively compensate noise and resolve harmonic ambiguities.

To this end, we apply a stochastic sequential model of simple decisions, the drift-diffusion model (DDM), to understand risky decision behavior. Numerous studies have demonstrated that mood can affect emotional and cognitive processing, but the exact nature of the impact music has on decision making in quantitative tasks has not been sufficiently studied. In our experiment, participants decided whether to accept or reject multiple bets with different risk vs. reward ratios while listening to music that was chosen to induce positive or negative mood. Our results indicate that music indeed alters people’s behavior in a surprising way - happy music made people make better choices. In other words, it made people more likely to accept good bets and reject bad bets. The DDM decomposition indicated the effect focused primarily on both the caution and the information processing aspects of decision making. To further understand the correspondence between auditory features and decision making, we studied how individual aspects of music affect response patterns. Our results are particularly interesting when compared with recent results regarding the impact of music on emotional processing, as they illustrate that music affects analytical decision making in a fundamentally different way, hinting at a different psychological mechanism that music impacts.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-36.211746, 20.668175]","[52.520992, -14.605152]","[-16.526485, 8.673358, -12.818305]","[21.79507, 12.030156, 17.704222]","[14.8445835, 9.356953]","[9.590419, 5.8365445]","[17.22317, 7.069358, -0.25991854]","[9.109899, 8.137033, 13.131263]"

Building on the type theory in information theory (Cover & Thomas 2006), we use a Bayesian generative model of musical features and compute the typicality of a song as the sum of the probabilities of the songs that share the type of the given song. To evaluate estimated results, we focused on vocal timbre which can be evaluated quantitatively by using the singer’s gender.

In this paper, we propose the time-delayed melody surface (TDMS), a novel feature based on delay coordinates that captures the melodic outline of a r¯aga. A TDMS describes both the tonal and the temporal characteristics of a melody, using only an estimation of the predominant pitch. Considering a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier, TDMSs outperform the state-of-the-art for r¯aga recognition by a large margin. We obtain 98% accuracy on a Hindustani music dataset of 300 recordings and 30 r¯agas, and 87% accuracy on a Carnatic music dataset of 480 recordings and 40 r¯agas. TDMSs are simple to implement, fast to compute, and have a musically meaningful interpretation. Since the concepts and formulation behind the TDMS are generic and widely applicable, we envision its usage in other music traditions beyond Indian art music.",ESP,education,Developed economies,"[-15.022975, -25.120949]","[-3.591725, 17.626682]","[8.361636, 1.8225764, -18.187548]","[1.4295638, 18.4782, 12.026219]","[11.336808, 11.460123]","[4.2553368, 3.7458396]","[15.164256, 8.3675375, 1.4963745]","[4.379556, 9.569463, 14.961686]"

However, existing transcription systems that have been described in research papers typically focus on multi-F0 estimation from audio and only output notes in absolute terms, showing frequency and absolute time (a piano-roll representation), but not in musical terms, with spelling distinctions (e.g., A♭ versus G♯) and quantized meter. To complete the transcription process, one would need to convert the piano-roll representation into a properly formatted and musically meaningful musical score. This process is non-trivial and largely unresearched. In this paper we present a system that generates music notation output from human-recorded MIDI performances of piano music. We show that the correct estimation of the meter, harmony and streams in a piano performance provides a solid foundation to produce a properly formatted score.

In this work, supervised learning is used to train a PCFG for the task of melodic reduction, using the tree analyses provided by the GTTM dataset. The resulting model is evaluated on its ability to create accurate reduction trees, based on a node-by-node comparison with ground-truth trees.

The automatic separation of music into voices is complicated by the fact that music spans a voice-leading continuum ranging from monophonic, to homophonic, to polyphonic, often within the same work. We address this diversity by defining voice separation as the task of partitioning music into streams that exhibit both a high degree of external perceptual separation from the other streams and a high degree of internal perceptual consistency, to the maximum degree that is possible in the given musical input. Equipped with this task definition, we manually annotated a corpus of popular music and used it to train a neural network with one hidden layer that is connected to a diverse set of perceptually informed input features. The trained neural model greedily assigns notes to voices in a left to right traversal of the input chord sequence. When evaluated on the extraction of consecutive within voice note pairs, the model obtains over 91% F-measure, surpassing a strong baseline based on an iterative application of an envelope extraction function.""",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-0.12614574, -48.565052]","[-43.917862, -16.45559]","[5.670524, -22.962978, -15.76632]","[-27.142328, -1.0618602, -0.09636869]","[9.096545, 12.032976]","[1.7191938, 6.3857675]","[13.554299, 10.574872, -0.85024965]","[4.7578588, 11.00985, 11.380429]"

Probability estimates are calculated in the derived viewpoint domain before an inverse function maps back to the basic event space to complete the model. Since an element in the derived viewpoint domain can potentially map onto multiple basic elements, probability mass is distributed between the basic elements with a uniform distribution.

We compare the resulting fingerings by the conventional Viterbi algorithm and our proposed minimax Viterbi algorithm to show the appropriateness of our new method.",JPN,education,Developed economies,"[58.408844, -3.6746225]","[-17.501402, -9.436484]","[15.0665045, -21.921278, 6.160992]","[-13.449547, 4.29758, -2.0159948]","[7.557263, 9.748994]","[3.7121608, 6.0802684]","[11.694092, 9.364389, 0.24609439]","[4.2982025, 9.748959, 12.591359]"

Since considerable effort has been devoted to estimate the frame-level F0s of singing voices from music audio signals, we tackle musical note estimation for those F0s to obtain a symbolic musical score. A naïve approach to musical note estimation is to quantize the vocal F0s at a semitone level in every time unit (e.g., half beat). This approach, however, fails when the vocal F0s are significantly deviated from those specified by a musical score. The onsets of musical notes are often delayed or advanced from beat times and the vocal F0s fluctuate according to singing expressions. To deal with these deviations, we propose a Bayesian hidden Markov model that allows musical notes to change in semi-synchronization with beat times. Both the semitone-level F0s and onset deviations of musical notes are regarded as latent variables and the frequency deviations are modeled by an emission distribution. The musical notes and their onset and frequency deviations are jointly estimated by using Gibbs sampling.

This guides segmentation and also lets us group basis sets for NMF. The number of sources, the types of sources, and when the sources are active are not known in advance. The only information is a specific type of layering structure. There is no separate training phase to learn a good basis set. No prior seeding of the NMF matrices is required. Unlike standard approaches to NMF there is no need for a post-processor to partition the learned basis functions by group. Source groups are learned automatically from the data.

Here we test whether such patterns are both characteristic of lute intabulations as a class (vs original lute music) and of different genres within that class. We use patterns identified in the musicological literature to search two annotated corpora of encoded lute music using the SIA(M)ESE algorithm. Diatonic patterns occur in many chromatic forms, accidentals being added depending how the arranger applied the conventions of musica ficta.

We test the use of priors to improve a committee of basic segmentation algorithms, and to improve a committee of cutting-edge approaches submitted to MIREX.

The leading voice is then modelled with a Smoothed Instantaneous Mixture Model (SIMM) based on a source-filter model. The main advantage of such a pitch salience function is that it enhances the leading voice even without explicitly separating it from the rest of the signal. We show that this is beneficial for melody extraction, increasing pitch estimation accuracy and reducing octave errors in comparison with simpler pitch salience functions.

Since dimensional complexity differentiates musical genres, and has been shown to affect similarity judgements following lifelong exposure, this experiment investigates the short-term influence of dimensional complexity on similarity judgements. Rhythmic and pitch sequences with two levels of complexity were factorially combined to create four distinct types of prototype melodies. 51 participants rated the similarity of each type of prototype melody (M) to two variations, one in which the pitch content was modified ( ¯ Mp), and another in which the rhythmic content was modified ( ¯ Mr).

A second processing step, called note segmentation, has to be performed for each pitch in order to identify the time intervals when the notes are played. In this study, a pitch-wise two-state on/off first-order Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is developed for note segmentation. A complete parametrization of the HMM sigmoid function is proposed, based on its original regression formulation, including a parameter α of slope smoothing and β of thresholding contrast. A comparative evaluation of different note segmentation strategies was performed, differentiated according to whether they use a fixed threshold, called “Hard Thresholding” (HT), or a HMM-based thresholding method, called “Soft Thresholding” (ST). This evaluation was done following MIREX standards and using the MAPS dataset. Also, different transcription and recording scenarios were tested using three units of the Audio Degradation toolbox.

Quantifying raga similarity becomes extremely challenging as it demands assimilation of both intrinsic (viz., notes, tempo) and extrinsic (viz. raga singing-time, emotions conveyed) properties of ragas. This paper introduces novel frameworks for quantifying similarities between ragas based on their melodic attributes alone, available in the form of bandish (composition) notation. Based on the hypothesis that notes in a particular raga are characterized by the company they keep, we design and train several deep recursive neural network variants with Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) units to learn distributed representations of notes in ragas from bandish notations. We refer to these distributed representations as note-embeddings. Note-embeddings, as we observe, capture a raga’s identity, and thus the similarity between note-embeddings signifies the similarity between the ragas. Evaluations with perplexity measure and clustering based method show the performance improvement in identifying similarities using note-embeddings over n-gram and uni-directional LSTM baselines. While our metric may not capture similarity between ragas in their entirety, it could be quite useful in various computational music settings that heavily rely on melodic information.",IND,education,Developing economies,"[-15.82778, -22.538174]","[-12.912735, -32.83963]","[6.163608, 4.814322, -17.979614]","[-6.502, 17.34615, 10.554385]","[11.600087, 11.262715]","[3.592512, 6.954135]","[15.296179, 8.222446, 1.3303529]","[5.081976, 9.32998, 11.392619]"

To estimate a variable-length chord sequence for a given melody, we iteratively refine the latent tree structure and the chord symbols and rhythms using a Metropolis-Hastings sampler with split-merge operations.

Among the common shortcomings are the lack of transparency in their creation and the difficulty of making them completely open and sharable.

To date, recurrent neural network (RNN) systems have achieved the highest evaluation accuracies for both drum solo and polyphonic recordings, however the accuracies within a polyphonic context still remain relatively low. To improve accuracy for polyphonic recordings, we present two approaches to the ADT problem: First, to capture the dynamism of features in multiple time-step hidden layers, we propose the use of soft attention mechanisms (SA) and an alternative RNN configuration containing additional peripheral connections (PC). Second, to capture these same trends at the input level, we propose the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which uses a larger set of time-step features. In addition, we propose the use of a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) in the peak-picking stage. The proposed systems are evaluated along with two state-of-the-art ADT systems in five evaluation scenarios, including a newly-proposed evaluation methodology designed to assess the generalisability of ADT systems.

The goal is to develop algorithms that automatically identify segmenting time points in music that closely matches human annotated data. The annotation itself is challenging due to its subjective nature, such as the degree of change that constitutes a boundary, the location of such boundaries, and whether a boundary should be assigned to a single time frame or a range of frames. Existing datasets have been annotated by small number of experts and the annotators tend to be constrained to specific definitions of segmentation boundaries. In this paper, we re-examine the annotation problem. We crowdsource the problem to a large number of annotators and present an analysis of the results. Our preliminary study suggests that although there is a correlation to existing datasets, this form of annotations reveals additional information such as stronger vs. weaker boundaries, gradual vs. sudden boundaries, and the difference in perception of boundaries between musicians and non-musicians.

We are particularly interested in being able to identify songs which are intelligible to second language learners, as such individuals often sing along the song to help them learn their second language, but this is only helpful if the song is intelligible enough for them to understand. As no automatic system for identifying ‘intelligible’ songs currently exists, songs for second language learners are generally selected by hand, a time-consuming and onerous process. We conducted an experiment in which test subjects, all of whom are learning English as a second language, were presented with 100 excerpts of songs drawn from five different genres. The test subjects listened to and transcribed the excerpts and the intelligibility of each excerpt was assessed based on average transcription accuracy across subjects. Excerpts that were more accurately transcribed on average were considered to be more intelligible than those less accurately transcribed on average. We then tested standard acoustic features to determine which were most strongly correlated with intelligibility. Our final system classifies the intelligibility of the excerpts and achieves 66% accuracy for 3 classes of intelligibility.",SGP,education,Developing economies,"[-32.570656, -32.072514]","[-10.781085, 13.002345]","[-14.091007, -12.259164, -16.21798]","[11.154999, 14.688772, 19.59759]","[11.991741, 12.364228]","[4.136968, 4.9907074]","[16.22358, 10.259257, 0.09410831]","[6.6698685, 9.816067, 13.194946]"

We show that finding the consensus among the output of different musical pattern discovery algorithms is challenging for two reasons: First, the number of patterns found by the algorithms exceeds patterns in human annotations by several orders of magnitude, with little agreement on what constitutes a pattern. Second, the algorithms perform inconsistently across different pieces. We show that algorithms lack a consensus with each other. Therefore, it is difficult to harness the collective wisdom of the algorithms to find ground truth patterns.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to tackle the cover song identification problem from a new perspective. We first construct a set of core songs, and represent each song in a high-dimensional space where each dimension indicates the pairwise distance between the given song and the other in the pre-defined core set. There are several advantages to this. First, using a number of reference songs in the core set, we make the most of relative distances to many other songs. Second, as all songs are transformed into the same high-dimensional space, kernel methods and metric learning are exploited for distance computation. Third, our approach does not depend on the computation method for the pairwise distance, and thus can use any existing algorithms.

Recent attempts at producing full music notation output have been hindered by the lack of an objective metric to measure the adherence of the results to the ground truth music score, and had to rely on time-consuming human evaluation by music theorists.

The metric reports the differences between two music scores based on twelve aspects: barlines, clefs, key signatures, time signatures, notes, note spelling, note durations, stem directions, groupings, rests, rest duration, and staff assignment.

For each tradition, we train n-gram language models on a representation of the chants as sequence of chromatic intervals. By computing perplexities of the melodies, we get an indication of the relations between the traditions, revealing the melodies of the Gregorian tradition as most diverse. Next, we perform a classification experiment using global features of the melodies. The choice of features is informed by expert knowledge. We use properties of the intervallic content of the melodies, and properties of the melismas, revealing that significant differences exist between the traditions. For example, the Gregorian melodies contain less step-wise intervals compared to the other repertoires.

However, beyond the sequential nature of musical content, relations and dependencies within a music segment can be more efficiently modeled as a graph. Polytopic Graphs have been recently introduced to model music structure so as to account for multiscale relationships between events located at metrically homologous instants. In this paper, we focus on the description of chord sequences and we study a specific set of graph configurations, called Primer Preserving Permutations (PPP). For sequences of 16 chords, PPPs account for 6 different latent systems of relations, corresponding to 6 main structural patterns (Prototypical Carrier Sequences or PCS). Observed chord sequences can be viewed as distorted versions of these PCS and the corresponding optimal PPP is estimated by minimizing a description cost over the latent relations. After presenting the main concepts of this approach, the article provides a detailed study of PPPs across a corpus of 727 chord sequences annotated from the RWC POP database (100 pop songs).

Given an input sequence and a statistical model, this mechanism uses belief propagation to sample a set of sequences whose distance to the input sequence is approximately within specified bounds. This mechanism uses local fields to bias the generation. We show experimentally that sampled sequences are indeed closely correlated to the standard musical similarity function defined by Mongeau and Sankoff.

Unlike previous work in real-time accompaniment, we focus on generating the accompaniment track in an off-line fashion by adapting a full-mix recording (e.g. a professional CD recording or Youtube video) to match the user’s tempo preferences. The input to the system is a set of recorded passages of a solo part played by the user (e.g. solo part in a violin concerto). These recordings are contiguous segments of music where the soloist part is active. Based on this input, the system identifies the corresponding passages within a full-mix recording of the same piece (i.e. contains both solo and accompaniment parts), and these passages are temporally warped to run synchronously to the solo-only recordings. The warped passages can serve as accompaniment tracks for the user to play along with at a tempo that matches his or her ability or desired interpretation. As the main technical contribution, we introduce a segmental dynamic time warping algorithm that simultaneously solves both the passage identification and alignment problems.

In this paper we propose a framework for automatically generating continuous f0 annotations without requiring manual refinement: the estimate of a pitch tracker is used to drive an analysis/synthesis pipeline which produces a synthesized version of the track. Any estimation errors are now reflected in the synthesized audio, meaning the tracker’s output represents an accurate annotation. Analysis is performed using a wide-band harmonic sinusoidal modeling algorithm which estimates the frequency, amplitude and phase of every harmonic, meaning the synthesized track closely resembles the original in terms of timbre and dynamics. Finally the synthesized track is automatically mixed back into the multitrack. The framework can be used to annotate multitrack datasets for training learning-based algorithms. Furthermore, we show that algorithms evaluated on the automatically generated/annotated mixes produce results that are statistically indistinguishable from those they produce on the original, manually annotated, mixes.

It is therefore of much interest in pedagogy to understand what ungrammaticality might mean in the context of a given raga, and possibly develop means to detect this in an audio recording of the raga performance. One prominent notion is that ungrammaticality is considered to occur only when the performer “treads” on another, possibly allied, raga in a listener’s perception. With this view, we consider modeling the technical boundary of a raga as that which separates it from another raga that is closest to it in its distinctive features. We wish to find computational models that can indicate ungrammaticality using a data-driven estimation of the model parameters; i.e. the raga performances of great artists are used to obtain representations that discriminate most between same and different raga performances.

Neither the model nor the generative procedure are tied to a particular causal direction of composition. Our model is an instance of orderless NADE [36], which allows more direct ancestral sampling.

We thus propose a hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model (HHSMM) that combines a score model representing the rhythms and pitches of musical notes with musical scales with an F0 model representing time-frequency deviations from a note sequence specified by a score. In the score model, musical scales are generated stochastically. Note pitches are then generated according to the scales and note onsets are generated according to a Markov process defined on the tatum grid. In the F0 model, onset deviations, smooth note-to-note F0 transitions, and F0 deviations are generated stochastically and added to the note sequence.

The API is designed to facilitate both, the development of modules and the integration of modules or module graphs into applications. It formalizes the processing of streams of multidimensional data frames which may represent regularly sampled signals as well as time-tagged events or numeric annotations.

Given only a description of the pieces in text format (i.e. no score information is provided), a reference database is automatically compiled by acquiring a number of audio representations (performances of the pieces) from internet sources. These are transcribed, preprocessed, and used to build a reference database via a robust symbolic fingerprinting algorithm, which in turn is used to identify new, incoming queries. The main challenge is the amount of noise that is introduced into the identification process by the music transcription algorithm and the automatic (but possibly suboptimal) choice of performances to represent a piece in the reference database. In a number of experiments we show how to improve the identification performance by increasing redundancy in the reference database and by using a preprocessing step to rate the reference performances regarding their suitability as a representation of the pieces in question.

It is known that to accurately align piano performances, methods using the voice structure are needed. However, such methods typically have high computational cost and they are applicable only when prior voice information is given. It is pointed out that alignment errors are typically accompanied by performance errors in the aligned signal. This suggests the possibility of correcting (or realigning) preliminary results by a fast (but not-so-accurate) alignment method with a refined method applied to limited segments of aligned signals, to save the computational cost. To realise this, we develop a method for detecting performance errors and a realignment method that works fast and accurately in local regions around performance errors. To remove the dependence on prior voice information, voice separation is performed to the reference signal in the local regions. By applying our method to results obtained by previously proposed hidden Markov models, the highest accuracies are achieved with short computation time.

Using a corpus consisting of four datasets of Western classical music in symbolic form, we found that including skip-grams reduces data sparsity in n-gram distributions by (1) minimizing the proportion of n-grams with negligible counts, and (2) increasing the coverage of contiguous n-grams in a test corpus. What is more, skip-grams significantly outperformed contiguous n-grams in discovering conventional closing progressions (called cadences).",AUT,education,Developed economies,"[29.675112, 7.006729]","[4.3190265, 4.3851213]","[3.8187428, -27.701487, 16.056341]","[-3.741594, 22.457455, -5.1353364]","[10.324231, 10.090765]","[4.7444644, 7.1511745]","[14.327584, 8.63897, 0.21010324]","[5.1954556, 9.578702, 14.575887]"

The resulting model, named MidiNet, can be expanded to generate music with multiple MIDI channels (i.e. tracks). We conduct a user study to compare the melody of eight-bar long generated by MidiNet and by Google’s MelodyRNN models, each time using the same priming melody.

One benefit of using a semi-Markov model is that it enables the utilization of segment-level features, such as segment purity and chord coverage, that capture the extent to which the events in an entire segment of music are compatible with a candidate chord label. Correspondingly, we develop a rich set of segment-level features for a semi-CRF model that also incorporates the likelihood of a large number of chord-to-chord transitions. Evaluations on a dataset of Bach chorales and a corpus of theme and variations for piano by Beethoven and Mozart show that the proposed semi-CRF model outperforms a discriminatively trained Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that does sequential labeling of sounding events, thus demonstrating the suitability of semi-Markov models for joint segmentation and labeling of music.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[60.771282, -14.184253]","[-6.3750515, -24.316599]","[22.431408, -16.626184, 22.442947]","[-14.366121, 12.976777, -8.723204]","[6.847028, 10.280191]","[5.572008, 7.313197]","[11.29179, 9.502121, 1.0002421]","[4.704386, 11.448547, 14.680076]"

Early lessons typically target the mastering of individual strokes from the inventory of bols (spoken syllables corresponding to the distinct strokes) via training in the required articulatory gestures on the right and left drums. Exploiting the close links between the articulation, acoustics and perception of tabla strokes, this paper presents a study of the different timbral qualities that correspond to the correct articulation and to identified common misarticulations of the different bols. We present a dataset created out of correctly articulated and distinct categories of misarticulated strokes, all perceptually verified by an expert. We obtain a system that automatically labels a recording as a good or bad sound, and additionally identifies the precise nature of the misarticulation with a view to providing corrective feedback to the player. We find that acoustic features that are sensitive to the relatively small deviations from the good sound due to poorly articulated strokes are not necessarily the features that have proved successful in the recognition of strokes corresponding to distinct tabla bols as required for music transcription.",IND,education,Developing economies,"[48.69663, -7.1902757]","[-23.79939, -8.457691]","[25.516186, -18.356218, 6.4252214]","[-11.06641, -11.2352495, 2.3034346]","[7.5108023, 8.951851]","[3.3435311, 5.747152]","[11.648213, 9.011652, -0.4144465]","[4.338796, 9.806408, 12.46539]"

Technical barriers include the processing of overlapped notes, repeated note sequences, and silence. Most of these characteristics vary with expressions. In this paper, the audio-to-score alignment problem of expressive violin performance is addressed. We propose a two-stage alignment system composed of the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm, simulation of overlapped sustain notes, background noise model, silence detection, and refinement process, to better capture the onset. More importantly, we utilize the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method for synthesis of the reference signal in order to deal with highly diverse timbre in real-world performance. A dataset of annotated expressive violin recordings in which each piece is played with various expressive musical terms is used. The optimal choice of basic parameters considered in conventional alignment systems, such as features, distance functions in DTW, synthesis methods for the reference signal, and energy ratios, is analyzed. Different settings on different expressions are compared and discussed.

In this paper, we present several statistics of gamakas to arrive at a model of Carnatic music. We draw upon the two-component model of Carnatic Music, which splits it into a slowly varying ‘stage’ and a detail, called ‘dance’. Based on the statistics, we propose slightly altered def- initions of two similar components called constant-pitch notes and transients. An automated implementation of these deﬁnitions is used in collecting statistics from 84 concert renditions. We then suggest that the constant-pitch notes and tran- sients can be considered as context and detail respectively of the r¯aga, but add that both are necessary for deﬁning the r¯aga.

Therefore, we investigate end-to-end source separation in the time-domain, which allows modelling phase information and avoids fixed spectral transformations. Due to high sampling rates for audio, employing a long temporal input context on the sample level is difficult, but required for high quality separation results because of long-range temporal correlations. In this context, we propose the Wave-U-Net, an adaptation of the U-Net to the one-dimensional time domain, which repeatedly resamples feature maps to compute and combine features at different time scales. We introduce further architectural improvements, including an output layer that enforces source additivity, an upsampling technique and a context-aware prediction framework to reduce output artifacts.

Starting from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on logarithmic-magnitude mel spectrogram excerpts, we eliminate this dependency by forcing each first-layer convolutional filter to be zero-mean – that is, to have its coefficients sum to zero. In contrast to four other methods – data augmentation, instance normalization, spectral delta features, and per-channel energy normalization (PCEN) – that we evaluated on a largescale public dataset, zero-mean convolutions achieve perfect sound level invariance without any impact on prediction accuracy or computational requirements.

However, the operating principles behind peak picking are different to that of the cross entropy loss function, which minimises the absolute difference between the output and target values for a single frame. To generate activation functions more suited to peak-picking, we propose two versions of a new loss function that incorporates information from multiple time-steps: 1) multi-individual, which uses multiple individual time-step cross entropies; and 2) multi-difference, which directly compares the difference between sequential time-step outputs. We evaluate the newly proposed loss functions alongside standard cross entropy in the popular MIR tasks of onset detection and automatic drum transcription.

We start with a set of manual annotations of draft time-aligned lyrics and notes made by non-expert users of Karaoke games. This set comes without audio. Therefore, we need to find the corresponding audio and adapt the annotations to it. To that end, we retrieve audio candidates from the Web. Each candidate is then turned into a singing-voice probability over time using a teacher, a deep convolutional neural network singing-voice detection system (SVD), trained on cleaned data. Comparing the time-aligned lyrics and the singing-voice probability, we detect matches and update the time-alignment lyrics accordingly. From this, we obtain new audio sets. They are then used to train new SVD students used to perform again the above comparison. The process could be repeated iteratively.

Emotion-aware music information retrieval (MIR) has been difficult due to the subjectivity and temporality of emotion responses to music. Physiological signals are regarded as related to emotion and thus could potentially be exploited in emotion-aware music discovery. This study explored the possibility of using physiological signals to detect users' emotion responses to music, with consideration of individual characteristics (personality, music preferences, etc.). A user experiment was conducted with 23 participants who searched for music in a novel MIR system. Users' listening behaviors and self-reported emotion responses to a total of 628 music pieces were collected. During music listening, a series of peripheral physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance) were recorded from participants unobtrusively using a researchgrade wearable wristband. A set of features in the time- and frequency- domains were extracted from the physiological signals and analyzed using statistical and machine learning methods. Results reveal 1) significant differences in some physiological features between positive and negative arousal and mood categories, and 2) effective classification of emotion responses based on physiological signals for some individuals.

These utterances leverage the well-known speech-to-song illusory transformation which results in very catchy and easy to reproduce motifs. A second dataset provides EEG recordings for the perception of 10 full length songs. Using a multi-view deep generative model we demonstrate the feasibility of learning a shared latent representation of brain activity and auditory concepts, such as rhythmical motifs appearing across different instrumentations. Introspection of the model trained on the rhythm dataset reveals disentangled rhythmical and timbral features within and across subjects. The model allows continuous interpolation between representations of different observed variants of the presented stimuli.

The proposed method is based on a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network architecture directly trained with pairs of spectrograms and their corresponding symbolic scores in Western notation. Unlike standard pitch estimation methods, the proposed architecture does not need the music symbols to be aligned with their audio frames thanks to a Connectionist Temporal Classification loss function. Training and evaluation were performed using a large dataset of short monophonic scores (incipits) from the RISM collection, that were synthesized to get the ground-truth data.

We encode pages as strings of diatonic pitch intervals, ignoring rests, to reduce the effect of such errors. We extract indices comprising lists of two kinds of 'word'. Approximate matching is done by counting the number of common words between a query page and those in the collection.  The two word-types are (a) normal ngrams and (b) minimal absent words (MAWs). The latter have three important properties for our purpose: they can be built and searched in linear time, the number of MAWs generated tends to be smaller, and they preserve the structure and order of the text, obviating the need for expensive sorting operations.  We show that retrieval performance of MAWs is comparable with ngrams, but with a marked speed improvement. We also show the effect of word length on retrieval.

Specifically, two paradigms that harness information from unlabeled data, namely feature learning and student-teacher learning, are applied to two major types of ADT systems.

We propose a game approach to ADT, termed player vs transcriber (PvT), in which a player model aims to reduce transcription accuracy of a transcriber model by manipulating training data in two ways. First, existing data may be augmented, allowing the transcriber to be trained using recordings with modified timbres. Second, additional individual recordings from sample libraries are included to generate rare combinations. We present three versions of the PvT model: AugExist, which augments pre-existing recordings; AugAddExist, which adds additional samples of drum hits to the AugExist system; and Generate, which generates training examples exclusively from individual drum hits from sample libraries. The three versions are evaluated alongside a state-of-the-art deep learning ADT system using two evaluation strategies. The results demonstrate that including the player network improves the ADT performance and suggests that this is due to improved generalisability.

We consider it as a multi-label classification problem for each frame and use frame-level annotations as the supervisory signal in training the network. Moreover, we experiment with different ways to incorporate pitch information to our model, with the premise that doing so informs the model the notes that are active per frame, and also encourages the model to learn relative rates of energy buildup in the harmonic partials of different instruments.

At the present, models of harmonic syntax face challenges on the tasks of detecting local and higher-level modulations (most previous models assume a priori knowledge of key), computing connected parse trees for long sequences, and parsing sequences that do not end with tonic chords, but in turnarounds. This paper addresses those problems by proposing a new generative formalism Probabilistic Abstract Context-Free Grammars (PACFGs) to address these issues, and presents variants of standard parsing algorithms that efficiently enumerate all possible parses of long chord sequences and to estimate their probabilities. PACFGs specifically allow for structured non-terminal symbols in rich and highly flexible feature spaces. The inference procedure moreover takes advantage of these abstractions by sharing probability mass between grammar rules over joint features. The paper presents a model of the harmonic syntax of Jazz using this formalism together with stochastic variational inference to learn the probabilistic parameters of a grammar from a corpus of Jazz-standards. The PACFG model outperforms the standard context-free approach while reducing the number of free parameters and performing key finding on the fly.",CHE,education,Developed economies,"[28.126402, 8.935103]","[5.2591267, -30.18527]","[5.4022994, -24.25466, 15.868404]","[-9.381149, 12.200587, 3.8350735]","[10.298015, 10.0677395]","[5.056239, 7.1342916]","[14.348527, 8.490398, 0.27684528]","[4.6113305, 10.571814, 14.7111845]"

In parallel, music perception research has aimed to understand timbre based on human dissimilarity ratings. These lead to timbre spaces which exhibit perceptual similarities between sounds. However, they do not generalize to novel examples and do not provide an invertible mapping, preventing audio synthesis. Here, we show that Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) can bridge these lines of research and alleviate their weaknesses by regularizing the latent spaces to match perceptual distances collected from timbre studies. Hence, we propose three types of regularization and show that they lead to spaces that are simultaneously coherent with signal properties and perceptual similarities. We show that these spaces can be used for efficient audio classification. We study how audio descriptors are organized along the latent dimensions and show that even though descriptors behave in a non-linear way across the space, they still exhibit a locally smooth evolution. We also show that, as this space generalizes to novel samples, it can be used to predict perceptual similarities of novel instruments.

In this paper, we study whether we can have a convolutional GAN model that directly creates binaryvalued piano-rolls by using binary neurons. Specifically, we propose to append to the generator an additional refiner network, which uses binary neurons at the output layer. The whole network is trained in two stages. Firstly, the generator and the discriminator are pretrained. Then, the refiner network is trained along with the discriminator to learn to binarize the real-valued piano-rolls the pretrained generator creates.

Using this confidence measure, musical tracks which are likely to be misclassified, i.e. those with low confidence, can then be handled differently from those analysed by standard, fully automatic key detection methods. By means of a listening test, we demonstrate that our developed features significantly correlate with listeners' ratings of harmonic complexity, steadiness and the uniqueness of key. Furthermore, we demonstrate that tracks which are incorrectly labelled using an existing key detection system obtain low confidence values.

In order to find a better feature representing global characteristics of a melody, we propose to represent the melodic sequence of each musical piece by the parameters of a generative Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on its sequence. Because the trained RNN can generate the identical melodic sequence of each piece, we can expect that the RNN parameters contain the temporal information within the melody. In our experiment, we first train an RNN on all melodic sequences, and then use it as an initialisation to train an individual RNN on each melodic sequence. The similarity between two melodies is computed by using the distance between their individual RNN parameters. Experimental results showed that the proposed RNN-based similarity outperformed the baseline similarity obtained by directly comparing melodic sequences.",JPN,facility,Developed economies,"[-16.54234, -6.661894]","[-13.39446, -33.41625]","[-7.9444437, -1.7169315, -10.577047]","[-8.015511, 15.859769, 9.993619]","[12.031818, 10.736888]","[3.8414676, 7.089368]","[15.894991, 8.420695, 0.58741295]","[5.205099, 9.122304, 11.427136]"

Among them, Poisson matrix factorization (PMF) has raised a lot of interest, since it seems well-suited to the implicit data provided by listening counts. Additionally, it has proven to achieve state-ofthe-art performance while being scalable to big data. Yet, CF suffers from a critical issue, usually called cold-start problem: the system cannot recommend new songs, i.e., songs which have never been listened to. To alleviate this, one should complement the listening counts with another modality. This paper proposes a multi-modal extension of PMF applied to listening counts and tag labels extracted from the Million Song Dataset. In our model, every song is represented by the same activation pattern in each modality but with possibly different scales. As such, the method is not prone to the cold-start problem, i.e., it can learn from a single modality when the other one is not informative.

There are, however, many potential pitfalls, especially in early music, where scores are edited in different ways: variables include clefs, note values, types of barline, and editorial accidentals. Different score editors and optical music recognition software have their own ways of storing and exporting musical data. Choice of software and file formats, and their various parameters, can thus unintentionally bias data, as can decisions on how to interpret potentially ambiguous markings in original sources. This becomes especially problematic when data from different corpora are combined for computational processing, since observed regularities and irregularities may in fact be linked with inconsistent corpus collection methodologies, internal and external, rather than the underlying music.  This paper proposes guidelines, templates, and workflows for the creation of consistent early music corpora, and for detecting encoding biases in existing corpora.

The stationary points (STAs) of transients – points where the pitch curve changes direction – also carry melody information. In this paper, the precision of sung notes in Carnatic music is studied in detail by treating CPNs and STAs separately. There is variation among the nineteen musicians considered, but on average, the precision of CPNs increases exponentially with duration and settles at about 10 cents for CPNs longer than 0.5 seconds. For analyzing STAs, in contrast to Western music, r¯aga (melody) information is found to be necessary, and errors in STAs show a significantly larger standard deviation of about 60 cents. To corroborate these observations, the music was automatically transcribed and re-synthesized using CPN and STA information using two interpolation techniques.

Skipgrams have been found to be a powerful model for capturing semi-local dependencies in sequences of entities when dependencies may not be directly adjacent (see, for instance, the problems of modeling sequences of words or letters in computational linguistics). Since common skipgrams define locality based on indices, they can only be applied to a single stream of non-overlapping entities. This paper proposes a generalized skipgram model that allows arbitrary cost functions (defining locality), efficient filtering, recursive application (skipgrams over skipgrams), and memory efficient streaming. Further, a sampling mechanism is proposed that flexibly controls runtime and output size. These generalizations and optimizations make it possible to employ skipgrams for the discovery of repeated patterns of close, nonsimultaneous events or notes.

The features belonging to the middle level can both improve automatic recognition of high-level descriptors, and provide new music retrieval possibilities. Mid-level features are subjective and usually lack clear definitions. However, they are very important for human perception of music, and on some of them people can reach high agreement, even though defining them and therefore, designing a hand-crafted feature extractor for them can be difficult.

The proposed method is compared to two baseline systems using approaches previously proposed for similar tasks. One baseline cross-correlates the audio fingerprints directly without DTW. The second baseline replaces the audio fingerprints with pitch chroma in the DTW algorithm. A new dataset annotating real-world data obtained from the Live Music Archive is presented and used for evaluation of the three systems.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-3.4069488, 3.7537928]","[-32.91785, 9.932277]","[8.318979, 7.4536533, -3.693337]","[-5.2013965, -0.46325645, -23.913229]","[11.186477, 8.456952]","[3.3474846, 2.214651]","[14.587989, 7.3641768, -1.7035328]","[3.3574982, 8.523439, 13.123257]"

The proposed method consists of a Query-net and a Separator: given a query and a mixture, the Query-net encodes the query into the latent space, and the Separator estimates masks conditioned by the latent vector, which is then applied to the mixture for separation. The Separator can also generate masks using the latent vector from the training samples, allowing separation in the absence of a query. We evaluate our method on the MUSDB18 dataset, and experimental results show that the proposed method can separate multiple sources with a single network.

We consider onset and offset detection as a hierarchical classification problem, where every local data representation as input is classified into one of all the possible event states in monophonic singing, namely the silence, activation, and transition states, and the transition state is further classified into the onset and offset states. An objective function based on this hierarchical taxonomy nicely guides the model to capture the complicated temporal dynamics of note sequences. Multi-channel data representations containing spectral differences and pitch saliency are employed to reflect the patterns of note transition in singing voice signals.

In general, an analogy is made by partially transferring the music abstractions, i.e., high-level representations and their relationships, from one piece to another; however, this procedure requires disentangling music representations, which usually takes little effort for musicians but is non-trivial for computers. Three sub-problems arise: extracting latent representations from the observation, disentangling the representations so that each part has a unique semantic interpretation, and mapping the latent representations back to actual music. In this paper, we contribute an explicitly-constrained variational autoencoder (EC^2-VAE) as a unified solution to all three sub-problems. We focus on disentangling the pitch and rhythm representations of 8-beat music clips conditioned on chords. In producing music analogies, this model helps us to realize the imaginary situation of ""what if"" a piece is composed using a different pitch contour, rhythm pattern, or chord progression by borrowing the representations from other pieces.

As opposed to the current methods, which are inherently restricted to be unsupervised due to the lack of 'aligned' data (i.e. the same musical piece played in multiple styles), we develop the first fully supervised algorithm for this task. At the core of our approach lies a synthetic data generation scheme which allows us to produce virtually unlimited amounts of aligned data, and hence avoid the above issue. In view of this data generation scheme, we propose an encoder-decoder model for translating symbolic music accompaniments between a number of different styles.

To reduce interference among the extracted loops, we propose an extra factorization step with a sparseness constraint and demonstrate that it improves the source separation result. We also propose a method for selecting the best instances of the extracted loops and demonstrate its effectiveness in an evaluation.

Although the previously proposed system employing a noise suppression process and a rule-based pitch control approach has achieved preliminary success in converting EL speech into a singing voice, there are still two major limitations. First, the converted singing voice still sounds mechanical and unnatural owing to the adverse impacts of spectrograms extracted from EL speeches, also making the effect of pitch control limited. Second, the capability and flexibility of the rule-based pitch control in modeling various singing styles are insufficient, causing the converted singing voices to lack variety. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an improved system that uses 1) a statistical voice conversion approach to convert spectrograms extracted from EL speeches into those of natural speeches and 2) a deep generative model-based approach called VAE-SPACE for pitch modification, which generates pitch patterns in a data-driven manner instead of following manually designed rules.

This can be done by manually annotating one reference performance, and then automatically synchronizing other performances, using audio-to-audio alignment algorithms. In this paper we address several questions related to those tasks. First, we analyze different annotations of the same musical piece, quantifying timing deviations between the respective human annotators. A statistical evaluation of the marker time stamps will provide (a) an estimate of the expected timing precision of human annotations and (b) a ground truth for subsequent automatic alignment experiments.

This is commonly addressed by defining some heuristic notion of pattern significance, and returning only the most significant patterns. This paper develops a method of pattern discovery that models human judgement of what constitutes a significant pattern by incorporating annotations of repeated patterns, avoiding the need to design heuristics.  We take pattern discovery as a clustering task, where the input is a set of passages of monophonic music, represented as vectors of extracted features, and the output clusters correspond to discovered patterns. The human annotations are used to train a neural network to learn a low-dimensional embedding of the feature space that maps passages of music close together when they are occurrences of the same ground-truth pattern. The results of this approach match up with the annotations significantly better than the results of an approach using clustering without subspace learning.

For reconstruction, latent variables of timbre and pitch are sampled from corresponding mixture components, and are concatenated as the input to a decoder. We show the model's efficacy using latent space visualization, and a quantitative analysis indicates the discriminability of these spaces, even with a limited number of instrument labels for training. The model allows for controllable synthesis of selected instrument sounds by sampling from the latent spaces. To evaluate this, we trained instrument and pitch classifiers using original labeled data. These classifiers achieve high F-scores when tested on our synthesized sounds, which verifies the model's performance of controllable realistic timbre/pitch synthesis.

However, this has limitations because it is often ambiguous whether a pitch is present or absent, making a binary choice difficult for humans and algorithms alike. For example, when a source fades out or reverberates, the exact point where the pitch is no longer present is unclear. Many single-f0 estimation algorithms select a threshold for when a pitch is active or not, and different choices of threshold drastically affect the results of standard metrics. In this paper, we present a refinement on the existing single-f0 metrics, by allowing the estimated voicing to be represented as a continuous likelihood, and introducing a weighting on frame level pitch accuracy, which considers the energy of the source producing the f0 relative to the energy of the rest of the signal. We compare these metrics experimentally with the previous metrics using a number of algorithms and datasets and discuss the fundamental differences.

In this paper, we present humdrumR (""hum-drummer""), a software package designed to afford computational musicology research for both advanced and novice computer coders. Humdrum is a powerful and influential existing computational musicology framework, including the humdrum syntax—a flexible text data format with tens of thousands of extant scores available (Kern Scores)—and the Bash-based humdrum toolkit. HumdrumR is a modern replacement for the humdrum toolkit, based in the data-analysis/statistical programming language R. By combining the flexibility and transparency of the humdrum syntax with the powerful data analysis tools and concise syntax of R, humdrumR offers an appealing new approach to would-be computational musicologists. HumdrumR leverages R's powerful metaprogramming capabilities to create an extremely expressive and composable syntax, allowing novices to achieve usable analyses quickly while avoiding many coding concepts that are commonly challenging for beginners.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[2.6939983, 5.5448947]","[12.543011, -17.731411]","[-3.8456163, 0.5606687, 4.667764]","[4.0179496, 2.4466007, 8.756946]","[12.06896, 8.964577]","[6.604555, 3.120231]","[15.113598, 7.461193, -0.046979424]","[5.8904767, 8.478585, 14.164801]"

In this article, we extend state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks to the classification of IPTs. We build the first IPT corpus from independent sound banks, annotate it with the JAMS standard and make it freely available. Our models yield consistently high accuracies on a homogeneous subset of this corpus. However, only a proper taxonomy of IPTs and specifically defined input transforms offer proper resilience when addressing the ""minus-1db"" methodology, which assesses the ability of the models to generalize.

Recent approaches to melodic elaboration have converged to a representation based on intervals, which allows the elaboration of pairs of notes. However, two problems remain: First, an interval-first representation obscures one-sided operations like neighbor notes. Second, while models of Western melody styles largely agree on step-wise operations such as neighbors and passing notes, larger intervals are either attributed to latent harmonic properties or left unexplained. This paper presents a grammar for melodies in North Indian raga music, showing not only that recursively applied neighbor and passing note operations underlie this style as well, but that larger intervals are generated as generalized neighbors, based on the tonal hierarchy of the underlying scale structure. The notion of a generalized neighbor is not restricted to ragas but can be transferred to other musical styles, opening new perspectives on latent structure behind melodies and music in general. The presented grammar is based on a graph representation that allows one to express elaborations on both notes and intervals, unifying and generalizing previous graph- and tree-based approaches.",CHE,education,Developed economies,"[-12.552602, -15.568364]","[-2.5012057, 19.731579]","[-3.461052, -3.6379654, -15.60897]","[-2.9652555, 18.564663, 10.451882]","[11.248957, 10.8907]","[4.129533, 3.563051]","[15.006038, 8.632766, 1.0359478]","[4.261738, 9.558465, 14.9467535]"

A typical solution to this problem is a proposed orchestral score where candidate scores are ranked by similarity in some feature space between the target sound and the mixture of audio samples in the database corresponding to the notes in the score; in the orchestral setting, valid scores may contain dozens of instruments sounding simultaneously.  Generally, target-based assisted orchestration systems consist of a combinatorial optimization algorithm and a constraint solver that are jointly optimized to find valid solutions.  A key step in the optimization involves generating a large number of combinations of sounds from the database and then comparing the features of each mixture of sounds with the target sound.  Because of the high computational cost required to synthesize a new audio file and then compute features for every combination of sounds, in practice, existing systems instead estimate the features of each new mixture using precomputed features of the individual source files making up the combination.  Currently, state of the art systems use a simple linear combination to make these predictions, even if the features in use are not themselves linear.  In this work, we explore neural models for estimating the features of a mixture of sounds from the features of the component sounds, finding that standard features can be estimated with accuracy significantly better than that of the methods currently used in assisted orchestration systems.

In this article, we investigate methods for automatically enhancing structural annotations by inferring (and expanding) hierarchical information from the segment labels. The proposed method complements existing techniques for comparing hierarchical structural annotations by coarsening or refining labels with variation markers to either collapse similarly labeled segments together, or separate identically labeled segments from each other.

Although there are various systems for music retrieval based on the similarity between songs or artists and for music browsing based on visualized songs, it is still difficult to explore unfamiliar content by flexibly combining multiple musical aspects. Query-by-Blending overcomes this difficulty by representing each of the aspects as a latent vector representation (called a ""flavor"" in this paper) that is a distinctive quality felt to be characteristic of a given word/song/artist. By giving a lyric word as a query, for example, a user can find songs and artists whose flavors are similar to the flavor of the query word.  Moreover, by giving a query combining (blending) lyric-word and song-audio flavors, the user can interactively explore unfamiliar content containing the blended flavor. This multi-aspect blending was achieved by constructing a novel vector space model into which all of the lyric words, song audio tracks, and artist IDs of a collection can be embedded.

This study therefore proposes a multi-task learning model to jointly identify dynamic, articulation, and phrasing cues from conducting kinematics. A professional conducting movement dataset is compiled using a high-resolution motion capture system. The ReliefF algorithm is applied to select significant features from conducting movement, and recurrent neural network (RNN) is implemented to identify multiple movement cues. The experimental results disclose key elements in conducting movement which communicate musical expressiveness; the results also highlight the advantage of multi-task learning in the complete musical context over single-task learning.

We propose StyleRank, a method to measure the similarity between a MIDI file and an arbitrary musical style delineated by a collection of MIDI files. MIDI files are encoded using a novel set of features and an embedding is learned using Random Forests. Experimental evidence demonstrates that StyleRank is highly correlated with human perception of stylistic similarity, and that it is precise enough to rank generated samples based on their similarity to the style of a corpus.

Recent advances in deep learning have turned typical OMR obstacles into clearly solvable problems, especially the stages that visually process the input image, such as staff line removal or detection of music-notation objects. However, merely detecting objects is not enough for retrieving the actual content, as music notation is a configurational writing system where the semantic of a primitive is defined by its relationship to other primitives. Thus, OMR systems must employ a notation assembly stage to infer such relationships among the detected objects. So far, this stage has been addressed by devising a set of predefined rules or grammars, which hardly generalize well. In this work, we formulate the notation assembly stage from a set of detected primitives as a machine learning problem. Our notation assembly is modeled as a graph that stores syntactic relationships among primitives, which allows us to capture the configuration of symbols in a music-notation document.

Zero-shot learning can address this problem by leveraging an additional semantic space of labels where auxiliary information about the labels is used to unveil the relationship between each other.  In this work, we investigate the zero-shot learning in music domain and organize two different setups of auxiliary information. One is using human-labeled attribute information based on Free Music Archive and OpenMIC-2018 datasets. The other is using general word semantic information based on Million Song Dataset and Last.fm tag annotations.

Of these previous approaches, only constraint programming has led to a successful solution. Unfortunately, this solution is expensive in terms of computation time. We present here two new search heuristics and a modification to a previously proposed heuristic, that, when applied to a greedy backtracking algorithm, allow the all-partition array problem to be solved in a practical running time.

Besides music generation, the same model can be used for sentiment analysis of symbolic music. We evaluate the accuracy of the model in classifying sentiment of symbolic music using a new dataset of video game soundtracks.

Invertible models unify both discriminative and generative aspects in one function, sharing one set of parameters. Introducing invertibility enables the practitioner to directly inspect what the discriminative model has learned, and exactly determine which inputs lead to which outputs. For the task of transcribing polyphonic audio into symbolic form, these models may be especially useful as they allow us to observe, for instance, to what extent the concept of single notes could be learned from a corpus of polyphonic music alone (which has been identified as a serious problem in recent research). This is an entirely new approach to audio transcription, which first of all necessitates some groundwork. In this paper, we begin by looking at the simplest possible invertible transcription model, and then thoroughly investigate its properties. Finally, we will take first steps towards a more sophisticated and capable version.

One major challenge in F0-based tonal analysis is introduced by unstable regions in the trajectories due to pitch slides and other frequency fluctuations. In this paper, we describe two approaches for detecting stable regions in frequency trajectories: the first algorithm uses morphological operations inspired by image processing, and the second one is based on suitably defined binary time–frequency masks. To avoid undesired distortions in subsequent analysis steps, both approaches keep the original F0-values unmodified, while only removing F0-values in unstable trajectory regions.

Such structure can be captured elegantly using probabilistic grammatical models similar to those used to study natural language. They address the complexity of the structure using abstract categories in a recursive formalism. Most existing grammatical models of musical structure focus on one single dimension of music--such as melody, harmony, or rhythm. While these grammar models often work well on short musical excerpts, accurate analysis of longer pieces requires taking into account the constraints from multiple domains of structure. The present paper proposes abstract product grammars--a formalism which integrates multiple dimensions of musical structure into a single grammatical model--along with efficient parsing and inference algorithms for this formalism. We use this model to study the combination of hierarchically-structured harmonic syntax and hierarchically-structured rhythmic information. The latter is modeled by a novel grammar of rhythm that is capable of expressing temporal regularities in musical phrases. It integrates grouping structure and meter. The combined model of harmony and rhythm outperforms both single-dimension models in computational experiments.

Here we propose a solid statistical approach based on a homogeneity-, repetitiveness-, and regularity-aware hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model. The higher-level semi-Markov chain represents a sequence of sections that tend to have regularly spaced boundaries. The timbral features in each section are assumed to follow emission distributions that are homogeneous over time.

Computational approaches to such structural analysis are still challenging, owing to the fact that the boundary between different harmonic states (such as chord functions) is not explicitly defined in the audio or symbolic music data. It is a novel approach to improve chord recognition by jointly identifying chord change using end-to-end sequence learning. In this paper, we propose the Harmony Transformer, a multi-task music harmony analysis model aiming to improve chord recognition through incorporating chord segmentation into the recognition process. The integration of chord segmentation and chord recognition is implemented with the Transformer, a deep sequential learning model yielding fruitful results in the field of natural language processing. A non-autoregressive decoding framework is also adopted here in aid of concatenating the two highly correlated tasks.

Other, larger datasets such as OpenMIC only have weak labels, i.e., instrument presence or absence is annotated only for long snippets of a song.

Once the MIDI and cell phone image have been converted into bootleg scores, we estimate the alignment using dynamic programming.

We focus on the task of symbol-based, monophonic, harmony-constrained jazz improvisations. Our personalization pipeline begins with BebopNet, a music language model trained on a corpus of jazz improvisations by Bebop giants. BebopNet is able to generate improvisations based on any given chord progression. We then assemble a personalized dataset, labeled by a specific user, and train a user-specific metric that reflects this user's unique musical taste. Finally, we employ a personalized variant of beam-search with BebopNet to optimize the generated jazz improvisations for that user. We present an extensive empirical study in which we apply this pipeline to extract individual models as implicitly defined by several human listeners. Our approach enables an objective examination of subjective personalized models whose performance is quantifiable.

This paper proposes a human-centred approach to creating thumbnails based on listeners' perception, directly asking listeners to identify the most characteristic fragment. We carried out a user study to assign representativeness scores to multiple fragments from a selection of popular music tracks. To strengthen the results, we performed a replication of the same user study with new participants and a different set of music. Thereafter, we used audio features, the segmentation algorithm, and participants' overall familiarity with the songs to predict representativeness scores. The results suggest that neither segmentation nor familiarity have a significant impact on users' thumbnail preferences: even segments with starting points that pay no regard to song structure can be suitable thumbnails. Three high-level audio characteristics, however, do impact the perceived representativeness of a fragment: Raw Intensity, Melodic Conventionality, and Conventionally of Intensity.

Due to the scarcity of publicly available multi-track choir recordings, we create a dataset of synthesized Bach chorales. We apply data augmentation to alter the chorales so that they more faithfully represent music from a broader range of choral genres. For separation we employ Wave-U-Net, a time-domain convolutional neural network (CNN) originally proposed for vocals and accompaniment separation. We show that Wave-U-Net outperforms a baseline implemented using score-informed NMF (non-negative matrix factorization). We introduce score-informed Wave-U-Net to incorporate the musical score into the separation process. We experiment with different score conditioning methods and show that conditioning on the score leads to improved separation results. We propose a 'score-guided' model variant in which separation is guided by the score alone, bypassing the need to specify the identity of the extracted source. Finally, we evaluate our models (trained on synthetic data only) on real choir recordings and find that in the absence of a large training set of real recordings, NMF still performs better than Wave-U-Net in this setting.

Second, while still relatively low, we found that recommendation-based streaming has a slightly higher proportion of female creators than ""organic"" listening (i.e., tracks that are not recommended by editors or algorithms). Third, we examined streaming data from 200,000 US users to determine the proportion of female artists in organic and recommended streams over a 28-day period and the relationship between recommended streams and users' future organic listening. The proportion of female artists in recommended streaming appears predictive of the proportion of female artists in organic streaming; these effects are moderated by gender and age. Fourth, this study also samples creators across different popularity levels, seeing more female and multi-gender groups at lower levels than in the middle tiers. However, solo female artists are better represented again in the superstars category, suggesting influence of selected superstars and genres.

By relying on an adversarial confusion criterion on given musical annotations, we force the latent space of a generative model to abstract from these features. Then, reintroducing these features as conditioning to the generative function, we obtain a continuous control over them. To demonstrate our approach, we rely on sets of musical attributes computed by the jSymbolic library as annotations and conduct experiments that show that our method outperforms previous methods in control.

We address this issue in two ways: (1) we recast the problem to be based on raw sheet music images rather than a symbolic music format, and (2) we propose an approach that can be trained on unlabeled data.  Our approach first converts the sheet music image into a sequence of musical ``words"" based on the bootleg feature representation, and then feeds the sequence into a text classifier.  We show that it is possible to significantly improve classifier performance by first training a language model on a set of unlabeled data, initializing the classifier with the pretrained language model weights, and then finetuning the classifier on a small amount of labeled data.  We train AWD-LSTM, GPT-2, and RoBERTa language models on all piano sheet music images in IMSLP.  We find that transformer-based architectures outperform CNN and LSTM models, and pretraining boosts classification accuracy for the GPT-2 model from 46% to 70% on a 9-way classification task.

A typical strategy is to compare score–audio pairs based on a common mid-level representation, such as chroma features. Several recent studies demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning models that learn task-specific mid-level representations from temporally aligned training pairs. However, in practice, there is often a lack of strongly aligned training data, in particular for real-world scenarios. In our study, we use weakly aligned score–audio pairs for training, where only the beginning and end of a score excerpt is annotated in an audio recording, without aligned correspondences in between. To exploit such weakly aligned data, we employ the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss to train a deep learning model for computing an enhanced chroma representation. We then apply this model to a cross-modal retrieval task, where we aim at finding relevant audio recordings of Western classical music, given a short monophonic musical theme in symbolic notation as a query.

Due to the historical emphasis in legal opinions on melody as the key criterion for deciding infringement, we predicted that listening to melody-only versions would result in percep-tual judgements that more closely matched actual past legal decisions. Surprisingly, however, we found no sig-nificant differences between the three conditions, with participants matching past decisions in between 50-60% of cases in all three conditions. Automated algorithms designed to calculate melodic and audio similarity pro-duced comparable results: both algorithms were able to match past decisions with identical accuracy of 71% (12/17 cases). Analysis of cases that were difficult to classify suggests that melody, lyrics, and other factors sometimes interact in complex ways difficult to capture using quantitative metrics.

All of these studies have used the RAG-C dataset of approximately 11,000 symbolically-encoded ragtime pieces to identify salient rhythmic patterns in the corpus and  qualify how they are used.  Ragtime music is distinguished from other musical genres by frequent use of syncopation, and previous computational studies have confirmed a number of musicological hypotheses regarding the use of syncopated patterns in ragtime compositions.  In this work, we extend these studies to investigate further questions involving the use of syncopation.  Specifically, we introduce a new methodological framework for processing the RAG-C dataset and confirm that experiments from previous studies obtain similar results using the new methodology.  We investigate the use of the common ``short-long-short'' syncopated pattern in different time periods and present new results detailing its use by three well-known ragtime composers.  We describe how the use of other syncopated patterns has evolved over time and the different distributions of patterns that result from those changes.  Lastly, we present novel results identifying statistically significant patterns in the way composers varied the amount of syncopation in consecutive measures in compositions.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[15.966374, -38.63115]","[-2.1636, 23.289268]","[20.499718, 10.723111, -13.614167]","[0.48339385, 4.977664, -4.615498]","[10.288083, 6.1882515]","[3.7393563, 3.3597286]","[13.052302, 6.424667, 0.337755]","[3.93387, 9.347669, 14.406673]"

Although chorus-section detection using audio signals has been studied, whether chorus sections can be detected from text-only lyrics is an open issue. Another open issue is whether patterns of repeating lyric lines such as those appearing in chorus sections depend on language. To investigate these issues, we propose a neural network-based model for sequence labeling. It can learn phrase repetition and linguistic features to detect chorus sections in lyrics text. It is, however, difficult to train this model since there was no dataset of lyrics with chorus-section annotations as there was no prior work on this task. We therefore generate a large amount of training data with such annotations by leveraging pairs of musical audio signals and their corresponding manually time-aligned lyrics; we first automatically detect chorus sections from the audio signals and then use their temporal positions to transfer them to the line-level chorus-section annotations for the lyrics.

To solve this problem, we propose chord jazzification, a process to generate realistic chord configurations in jazz style. With deep learning approaches, we decompose chord jazzification into coloring and voicing. Coloring concerns the choice of color tones, while voicing concerns the configurations of chords. We also create a new dataset featuring interpretations of chord symbols in pop-jazz compositions.

In short, our model connects and fuses two contextually unrelated sequences in a coherent way. This transformation can be applied iteratively to gradually fuse the input sequences. The style latent space is simultaneously learned, allowing users to control how the two sequences are merged.

This capability is essential to many meaningful applications that synchronize audio with a score in an on-line fashion. Existing algorithms often stumble on certain difficult cases, one of which is piano music. This paper presents a new method to tackle such cases. The method treats tempo as a variable rather than a constant (with constraints), allowing the program to adapt to live performance variations. This is first expressed by a Kalman filter model at the note level, and then by an almost equivalent switching state-space model at the audio frame level. The latter contains both discrete and continuous hidden variables, and is computationally intractable. We show how certain reasonable approximations make the computation manageable. This new method is tested on a dataset of 50 piano excerpts.

This new paradigm allows controlling the synthesis process through learned high-level features or by conditioning a model on musically relevant information.

The most commonly practiced setting for choir ensembles consists of four parts; Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass (SATB), each with its own range of fundamental frequencies (F0s). The task of source separation for this choral setting entails separating the SATB mixture into the constituent parts. Source separation for musical mixtures is well studied and many deep learning based methodologies have been proposed for the same. However, most of the research has been focused on a typical case which consists in separating vocal, percussion and bass sources from a mixture, each of which has a distinct spectral structure. In contrast, the simultaneous and harmonic nature of ensemble singing leads to high structural similarity and overlap between the spectral components of the sources in a choral mixture, making source separation for choirs a harder task than the typical case. This, along with the lack of an appropriate consolidated dataset has led to a dearth of research in the field so far.

Two central methods for representation learning include deep metric learning and classification, both having the same goal of learning a representation that can generalize well across tasks. Along with generalization, the emerging concept of disentangled representations is also of great interest, where multiple semantic concepts (e.g., genre, mood, instrumentation) are learned jointly but remain separable in the learned representation space. In this paper we present a single representation learning framework that elucidates the relationship between metric learning, classification, and disentanglement in a holistic manner. For this, we (1) outline past work on the relationship between metric learning and classification, (2) extend this relationship to multi-label data by exploring three different learning approaches and their disentangled versions, and (3) evaluate all models on four tasks (training time, similarity retrieval, auto-tagging, and triplet prediction). We find that classification-based models are generally advantageous for training time, similarity retrieval, and auto-tagging, while deep metric learning exhibits better performance for triplet-prediction. Finally, we show that our proposed approach yields state-of-the-art results for music auto-tagging.",KOR,education,Developing economies,"[-10.447858, 0.8562764]","[-25.250124, -42.63781]","[-8.638285, -12.011553, 10.53374]","[-27.37537, 12.8263235, 11.455787]","[12.110959, 9.917806]","[3.1449769, 7.637098]","[15.518118, 8.640721, -0.8038829]","[5.6905375, 9.333943, 11.190538]"

Music genres are valuable information, especially for music organization, personalized listening experience, and playlist generation. Automatically classifying music genres is a challenging endeavor due to the inherent ambiguity and subjectivity. Most efforts on music genre classification consider the complete independence between labels. However, music genres typically respect a hierarchical structure based on the influences or origins of each style. Conversely, many of the methods available for hierarchical classification are based on assumptions about the class hierarchy, such as the need for multiple children in each hierarchy's node, which may limit their use in music applications. Also, the local classifier per node approach that would be the most suitable for this scenario is costly regarding time and memory. In this paper, we present two local hierarchical classification approaches and show how to combine them to obtain a single one that is more robust and faithful to the music genre classification scenario. We evaluate our proposal in a music dataset hierarchically labeled with 120 music genres.

As a DJ mix is produced in a studio or the live version is recorded for music streaming services, computational methods to analyze DJ mixes, for example, extracting track information or understanding DJ techniques, have drawn research interests. Many of previous works are, however, limited to identifying individual tracks in a mix or segmenting it, and the sizes of the datasets are usually small. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of DJ music by aligning a mix to its original music tracks.

The pitch salience function is subsequently thresholded to obtain a multiple F0 estimation output. For training, we build a dataset that comprises several multi-track datasets of vocal quartets with F0 annotations.This work proposes and evaluates a set of CNNs for this task in diverse scenarios and data configurations, including recordings with additional reverb.

Specifically, we conduct a user study to answer three questions. Firstly, do most users agree which songs are most acoustically similar? Secondly, is acoustic similarity a good proxy for how an individual might construct a playlist or recommend music to a friend? Thirdly, if so, can we find acoustic features that are related to human judgments of acoustic similarity? To answer these questions, our study asked 117 test subjects to compare two unknown candidate songs relative to a third known reference song.

The input is then reconstructed by combining those variables. Under an unsupervised training setting, a major challenge is that encoders are tasked to capture factors of interest with distinct latent representations, without access to the corresponding ground-truth labels. We therefore introduce auxiliary tasks and objectives which leverage pitch shifting as a strategy to create surrogate labels, thereby encouraging the disentanglement of pitch and timbre.

We adopt a twin-neural network (Siamese) that learns to choose a preferred candidate in terms of singing quality between two inputs. With a few such pairwise comparisons, this method generates a relative rank-order of a complete list of singers. Additionally, we incorporate a knowledge-based musically-relevant pitch histogram representation, as a conditioning vector, to provide explicit musical information to the network.

In this study, we investigate the relationship between emotions perceived in pop and rock music (mainly in Euro-American styles) and personal characteristics from the listener, using language as a key feature. Our goal is to understand the influence of lyrics comprehension on music emotion perception and use this knowledge to improve Music Emotion Recognition (MER) models. We systematically analyze over 30K annotations of 22 musical fragments to assess the impact of individual differences on agreement, as defined by Krippendorff's coefficient. We employ personal characteristics to form group-based annotations by assembling ratings with respect to listeners' familiarity, preference, lyrics comprehension, and music sophistication. Finally, we study our group-based annotations in a two-fold approach: (1) assessing the similarity within annotations using manifold learning algorithms and unsupervised clustering, and (2) analyzing their performance by training classification models with diverse ""ground truths"". Our results suggest that a) applying a broader categorization of taxonomies and b) using multi-label, group-based annotations based on language, can be beneficial for MER models.",ESP,education,Developed economies,"[-54.15302, -1.723272]","[40.51055, -19.18732]","[-24.934174, 0.12623079, -14.815595]","[22.742115, 19.75479, 5.8956404]","[15.610488, 11.734929]","[9.1457815, 6.4405155]","[18.251965, 9.954075, 0.21184276]","[9.168882, 8.921957, 12.601872]"

The automation of this process has been object of study for a long time in the field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR), with a wide variety of proposed solutions.

However, most of the recent literature addresses only specific parts of the traditional OMR workflow such as music object detection or symbol classification. In this paper, we progress one step further by proposing a full-page OMR system for Mensural notation scores that consists of simply two processes, which are enough to extract the symbolic music information from a full page. More precisely, our pipeline uses Selectional Auto-Encoders to extract single staff regions, combined with end-to-end staff-level recognition based on Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for retrieving the music notation.

In this study, a new dataset is compiled for Guqin performance analysis. The mode detection is achieved by pattern matching, and the predicted results are conjoined with audio features to be inputted into a neural network for playing technique detection. Advanced techniques are developed to optimize the extracted pitch contour from the audio. It is manifest in the results that the global and local features are inter-connected in Guqin music.

A new measure of structural rhythmic similarity is also shown to correlate more strongly to similarity perception of drum loops than the more commonly used Hamming distance.

Given these difficulties, it is not easy to learn good feature representations with supervised learning techniques, either because of the insufficiency of labels, or the subjectiveness (and hence large variance) in human-annotated labels. In this paper, we present a framework that can learn high-level feature representations with a limited amount of data, by first modelling their corresponding quantifiable low-level attributes. We refer to our proposed framework as Music FaderNets, which is inspired by the fact that low-level attributes can be continuously manipulated by separate ""sliding faders"" through feature disentanglement and latent regularization techniques. High-level features are then inferred from the low-level representations through semi-supervised clustering using Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders (GM-VAEs). Using arousal as an example of a high-level feature, we show that the ""faders"" of our model are disentangled and change linearly w.r.t. the modelled low-level attributes of the generated output music. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model successfully learns the intrinsic relationship between arousal and its corresponding low-level attributes (rhythm and note density), with only 1% of the training set being labelled. Finally, using the learnt high-level feature representations, we explore the application of our framework in style transfer tasks across different arousal states.

We revisit the traditional 'textbook' classification approach (using the final, the range and initial note) as well as the only prior computational study we are aware of, which uses pitch profiles. Both approaches work well, but largely reduce modes to scales and ignore their melodic character. Our main contribution is a model that reaches 93–95% F1 score on mode classification, compared to 86–90% using traditional pitch-based musicological methods. Importantly, it reaches 81–83% even when we discard all absolute pitch information and reduce a melody to its contour. The model uses tf–idf vectors and strongly depends on the choice of units: i.e., how the melody is segmented. If we borrow the syllable or word structure from the lyrics, the model outperforms all of our baselines.

The authors hypothesize that when a person listens to novel (i.e., both unfamiliar and interesting) pieces of music, the retention rate will be proportional to the number of times the discovery engine suggests the pieces to her, as long as they remain novel. The authors have tested the hypothesis through a six-week human-subject experiment that simulates a real-world listening environment and a follow-up survey. During the experiment period, each subject received, through Discover Weekly in Spotify, suggestions for novel songs up to three times and provided evaluation. One month after the evaluation experiment, the human-subjects answered whether they had revisited the novel songs.

A basic approach to this task is to train a recurrent neural network (e.g., long short-term memory (LSTM) network) that directly predicts section labels from acoustic features. This approach, however, suffers from frequent musically unnatural label switching because the homogeneity, repetitiveness, and duration regularity of musical sections are hard to represent explicitly in the network architecture. To solve this problem, we formulate a unified hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) that represents the generative process of homogeneous mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients, repetitive chroma features, and mel spectra from section labels, where the emission probabilities of mel spectra are computed from the posterior probabilities of section labels predicted by an LSTM.

Thus, our paradigm invites and documents inter-annotator controversy based on a transparent set of analytical criteria, and aims at putting forth the consensual solutions emerging from such deliberations. The workflow that we suggest traces the entire genesis of annotation data, including the relevant discussions between annotators, reviewers, and curators. It adopts a well-proven pattern from collaborative software development, namely distributed version control, and allows for the automation of repetitive maintenance tasks, such as validity checks, message dispatch, or updates of meta- and paradata.

However, the explicit voice assignment of a piece (if present at all)  generally does not reflect all phenomena related to voice leading.

This paper presents a model of proto-voices,  voice-like structures that encode sequential and vertical relations between notes  without the need to assume explicit voices.  Proto-voices are constructed by recursive combination of primitive structural operations,  such as insertion of neighbor or passing notes,  or horizontalization of simultaneous notes.  Together, these operations give rise to a grammar-like hierarchical system  that can be used to infer the structural fabric of a piece using a chart parsing algorithm.

On the assumption that OMR systems might always make some errors, it is essential that the user corrects the output. This paper contributes to a better understanding of how music transcription is improved by the assistance of OMR systems that include the end-user in the recognition process. For that, we have measured the transcription time of a printed early music work under two scenarios: a manual one and a state-of-the-art OMR-assisted one, with several alternatives each.

At a low level, these terms generally involve textural properties, for example whether the guitar tends to play chords or single notes. At a higher level, they indicate the function the guitar is playing relative to other instruments of the ensemble, for example whether the guitar is accompanying in background, or if it is intended to play a part in the foreground. Automatic labelling of instrumental function has various potential applications including the creation of consistent datasets dedicated to the training of generative models that focus on a particular function. In this paper, we propose a computational method to identify rhythm guitar sections in symbolic tablatures.

However, there are still a number of open problems, such as a lack of robustness in the face of severe duration mismatches between audio and lyrics representation; a certain degree of language-specificity caused by acoustic differences across languages; and the fact that most successful methods in the field are not suited to work in real-time. Real-time lyrics alignment (tracking) would have many useful applications, such as fully automated subtitle display in live concerts and opera. In this work, we describe the first real-time-capable audio-to-lyrics alignment pipeline that is able to robustly track the lyrics of different languages, without additional language information. The proposed model predicts, for each audio frame, a probability vector over (European) phoneme classes, using a very small temporal context, and aligns this vector with a phoneme posteriogram matrix computed beforehand from another recording of the same work, which serves as a reference and a proxy to the written-out lyrics. We evaluate our system's tracking accuracy on the challenging genre of classical opera.

To determine if Jukebox's representations contain useful information for MIR, we use them as input features to train shallow models on several MIR tasks. Relative to representations from conventional MIR models which are pre-trained on tagging, we find that using representations from Jukebox as input features yields 30% stronger performance on average across four MIR tasks: tagging, genre classification, emotion recognition, and key detection. For key detection, we observe that representations from Jukebox are considerably stronger than those from models pre-trained on tagging, suggesting that pre-training via codified audio language modeling may address blind spots in conventional approaches.

In each SpecTNT block, a spectral Transformer extracts frequency-related features into the frequency class token (FCT) for each frame. Later, the FCTs are linearly projected and added to the temporal embeddings (TEs), which aggregate useful information from the FCTs. Then, a temporal Transformer processes the TEs to exchange information across the time axis. By stacking the SpecTNT blocks, we build the SpecTNT model to learn the representation for music signals.

By factoring music generation into sub-problems, our approach allows simpler models and requires less data. To customize or add variety, one can alter chords, basic melody, and rhythm structure in the music frameworks, letting our networks generate the melody accordingly.

In addition to the online, real-time-capable setting for performative use cases, automatic instrumentation can also find applications in assistive composing tools in an offline setting. Due to the lack of paired data of original solo music and their full arrangements, we approach automatic instrumentation by learning to separate parts (e.g., voices, instruments and tracks) from their mixture in symbolic multitrack music, assuming that the mixture is to be played on a keyboard. We frame the task of part separation as a sequential multi-class classification problem and adopt machine learning to map sequences of notes into sequences of part labels.

We then propose two novel formulations for end-to-end polyphonic OMR---one treating the problem as a type of multi-task binary classification, and the other treating it as multi-sequence detection. Building upon the encoder-decoder architecture and an image encoder proposed in past work on end-to-end OMR, we propose two novel decoder models---FlagDecoder and RNNDecoder---that correspond to the two formulations. Finally, we compare the empirical performance of these end-to-end approaches to polyphonic OMR and observe a new state-of-the-art performance with our multi-sequence detection decoder, RNNDecoder.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[11.967077, -22.265892]","[-29.907938, -12.603592]","[10.962692, 7.227486, 23.407303]","[-16.625498, -16.59621, 13.152762]","[11.17252, 5.611402]","[3.6377425, 0.6504915]","[12.994546, 9.130177, -2.9506385]","[3.710357, 7.289097, 12.058376]"

The performances thus cover the four quadrants of the activity/valence-space. The onsets and offsets, together with an associated pitch, were human-annotated for each note in each performance by the fiddle players themselves. First, they annotated the normal version. These annotations were then transferred to the expressive performances using music alignment and finally human-verified. Two separate music alignment methods based on image registration were developed for this purpose; a B-spline implementation that produces a continuous temporal transformation curve and a Demons algorithm that produces displacement matrices for time and pitch that also account for local timing variations across the pitch range. Both methods start from an ""Onsetgram"" of onset salience across pitch and time and perform the alignment task accurately. Various settings of the Demons algorithm were further evaluated in an ablation study. The final dataset is around 43 minutes long and consists of 19 734 notes of Hardanger fiddle music, recorded in stereo. The dataset and source code are available online.

Sometimes exaggerated, and sometimes subtle, these distortions are driven by a variety of factors, including schematic features (both structural such as phrase boundaries and surface events such as recurrent rhythmic patterns), as well as relatively rare veridical events that characterize the individuality and uniqueness of a particular piece.   Performers tend to adopt similar pervasive approaches to interpreting schemas, resulting in common performance practices, while often formulating less common approaches to the interpretation of veridical events. Furthermore, some performers choose anomalous interpretations of schemas. We present a machine learning model of expressive performance of Chopin Mazurkas and a critical analysis of the output based upon statistical analyses of the musical scores and of recorded performances. We compare the timings of recorded human performances of selected Mazurkas by Frédéric Chopin with performances of the same works generated by a neural network trained with recorded human performances of the entire corpus.

Particularly in polyphonic singing, where all musicians can continuously adapt their pitch, this leads to complex interactions. To achieve an overall balanced sound, the musicians dynamically adjust their intonation considering musical, perceptual, and acoustical aspects. When adapting the intonation in a recorded performance, a sound engineer may have to individually fine-tune the pitches of all voices to account for these aspects in a similar way. In this paper, we formulate intonation adaptation as a cost minimization problem. As our main contribution, we introduce a differentiable cost measure by adapting and combining existing principles for measuring intonation. In particular, our measure consists of two terms, representing a tonal aspect (the proximity to a tonal grid) and a harmonic aspect (the perceptual dissonance between salient frequencies). We show that, combining these two aspects, our measure can be used to flexibly account for different artistic intents while allowing for robust and joint processing of multiple voices in real-time.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn long-term symbolic music representations through contextual constraints. First, we use contrastive learning to pre-train a long-term representation by constraining its difference from the short-term representation (extracted by an off-the-shelf model). Then, we fine-tune the long-term representation by a hierarchical prediction model such that a good long-term representation (e.g., an 8-bar representation) can reconstruct the corresponding short-term ones (e.g., the 2-bar representations within the 8-bar range). Experiments show that our method stabilizes the training and the fine-tuning steps.

Traditional chroma features relying on signal processing are often influenced by timbral properties such as overtones or vibrato and, thus, only roughly correspond to the pitch classes indicated by a score. Deep learning provides a promising possibility to overcome such problems but requires large annotated datasets. Previous approaches therefore use either synthetic audio, MIDI-piano recordings, or chord annotations for training. Since these strategies have different limitations, we propose to learn transcription-like pitch-class representations using pre-synchronized score-audio pairs of classical music. We train several CNNs with musically inspired architectures and evaluate their pitch-class estimates for various instrumentations including orchestra, piano, chamber music, and singing.

Since traditional chroma variants obtained with signal processing suffer from timbral artifacts such as overtones or vibrato, they do not directly reflect the pitch classes notated in the score. For this reason, training a chroma representation using deep learning (""deep chroma"") has become an interesting strategy. Existing approaches involve the use of supervised learning with strongly aligned labels for which, however, only few datasets are available. Recently, the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, initially proposed for speech, has been adopted to learn monophonic (single-label) pitch-class features using weakly aligned labels based on corresponding score--audio segment pairs. To exploit this strategy for the polyphonic case, we propose the use of a multi-label variant of this CTC loss, the MCTC, and formalize this loss for the pitch-class scenario. Our experiments demonstrate that the weakly aligned approach achieves almost equivalent pitch-class estimates than training with strongly aligned annotations.

We show that these augmentation schemes lead to dramatic improvements in model performance, of a magnitude that exceeds the benefit of pretraining on all solo piano sheet music images in IMSLP. Second, we describe a way to modify previous models in order to enable cross-model transfer learning, in which a model trained entirely on sheet music can be used to perform composer classification of audio or MIDI data. Third, we explore the performance of trained models in a 1-shot learning context, in which the model performs classification among a set of composers that are unseen in training. Our results indicate that models learn a representation of compositional style that generalizes beyond the set of composers used in training.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[6.6689577, -15.021117]","[-22.900034, -19.364012]","[-13.859501, -18.636177, 7.7145867]","[-11.336845, -3.5139987, 8.211533]","[11.263929, 10.058708]","[3.3742297, 6.613542]","[14.76409, 9.251095, -1.4515771]","[4.8941045, 9.509697, 11.887674]"

Second, chords of the retrieved phrases are manipulated to match the lead sheet via style transfer. Lastly, the system offers controls over the generation process.

In this work, we propose a modular system for performing such a harmonic analysis, incorporating spelled pitches (i.e., not treating enharmonically equivalent pitches as identical) and using a very large vocabulary of 1540 chords (each with a root, type, and inversion) and 70 keys (with a tonic and mode), leading to a full harmonic characterization similar to Roman numeral analysis. Our system's modular design allows each of its components to model an aspect of harmony at an appropriate level of granularity, and also aids in both flexibility and interpretability.

We can reduce this complexity by several orders of magnitude by treating each label (e.g. key or chord quality) independently. However this has been shown to lead to incoherent output labels. To solve this issue we introduce a modified Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimation (NADE) as the last layer of a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network.

The data analysis methodology was tested with simulated beat tracks assessing robustness to tapping variability, mid-tapping beat change and disagreement between annotators. It was also tested on experimental tapping data where the entropy of the estimated beat distributions correlated with tapping difficulty reported by the participants.

The employed method to record tapping responses in audio format facilitates a fine-grained analysis of metrical accents that emerge from the responses. The identified differences between groups are related to the metrical structures inherent to the two musical styles, such as non-isochronicity of the beat, and differences between the groups document the influence of the deep enculturation of participants to their style of expertise.

The conventional approach to beat estimation is to train a deep neural network (DNN) that estimates the beat presence probability at each frame. This approach, however, relies heavily on a periodicity-aware post-processing step that detects beat times from the noisy probability sequence. To mitigate this problem, we have designed a DNN that estimates the beat phase at each frame whose period is equal to the beat interval. The estimation losses computed at all frames not limited to a fewer number of beat frames can thus be effectively used for backpropagation-based supervised training, whereas a DNN has conventionally been trained such that it constantly outputs zero at all non-beat frames. The same applies to downbeat estimation. We also modify the post-processing method for the estimated phase sequence. For joint beat and downbeat detection, we investigate multi-task learning architectures that output beat and downbeat phases in this order, in reverse order, and in parallel.

We had 3 experts independently transcribe a sample of 32 excerpts of traditional monophonic songs from around the world (half a cappella, half with instrumental accompaniment). 16 songs also had pre-existing transcriptions created by 3 different experts. We compared these human transcriptions against one another and against 10 automatic music transcription algorithms. We found that human transcriptions can be sufficiently reliable (~90% agreement, κ ~.7), but current automated methods are not (&lt;60% agreement, κ &lt;.4).

In this paper, we focus on the relationship between disentanglement and controllability by conducting a systematic study using different supervised disentanglement learning algorithms based on the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) architecture. Our experiments show that a high degree of disentanglement can be achieved by using different forms of supervision to train a strong discriminative encoder. However, in the absence of a strong generative decoder, disentanglement does not necessarily imply controllability. The structure of the latent space with respect to the VAE-decoder plays an important role in boosting the ability of a generative model to manipulate different attributes.

In order to assist the user, the sound matching task aims to estimate synthesis parameters that produce a sound closest to the query sound. Recently, neural networks have been employed for this task. These neural networks are trained on paired data of synthesis parameters and the corresponding output sound, optimizing a loss of synthesis parameters. However, synthesis parameters are only indirectly correlated with the audio output. Another problem is that query made by the user usually consists of real-world sounds, different from the synthesizer output used during training.   In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the problem of synthesizer sound matching by implementing a basic subtractive synthesizer using differentiable DSP modules. This synthesizer has interpretable controls and is similar to those used in music production. We can then train an estimator network by directly optimizing the spectral similarity of the synthesized output. Furthermore, we can train the network on real-world sounds whose ground-truth synthesis parameters are unavailable. We pre-train the network with parameter loss and fine-tune the model with spectral loss using real-world sounds.

The domain adaptation approach has thus recently been taken for updating an ASR model pre-trained from sufficient speech data.

Typically featuring a MIDI interface, it is usually impractical to control it from an audio source.

The training process involves a corpus of audio for supervision, and spectral reconstruction loss functions. Such functions, while being great to match spectral amplitudes, present a lack of pitch direction which can hinder the joint optimization of the parameters of FM synthesizers. In this paper, we take steps towards enabling continuous control of a well-established FM synthesis architecture from an audio input. Firstly, we discuss a set of design constraints that ease spectral optimization of a differentiable FM synthesizer via a standard reconstruction loss. Next, we present Differentiable DX7 (DDX7), a lightweight architecture for neural FM resynthesis of musical instrument sounds in terms of a compact set of parameters.

Recent neural synthesizers have exhibited a tradeoff between domain-specific models that offer detailed control of only specific instruments, or raw waveform models that can train on any music but with minimal control and slow generation. In this work, we focus on a middle ground of neural synthesizers that can generate audio from MIDI sequences with arbitrary combinations of instruments in realtime. This enables training on a wide range of transcription datasets with a single model, which in turn offers note-level control of composition and instrumentation across a wide range of instruments.

We compare training the decoder as an autoregressive model and as a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and find that the DDPM approach is superior both qualitatively and as measured by audio reconstruction and Fréchet distance metrics.

We also demonstrate that by modifying input representations --- which in prior work using neural models have often taken the form of one-hot encodings over individual keys on the piano --- to encode relative position on the keyboard to the prior note instead, we can achieve much better performance. Additionally, we reassess the use of raw per-note labeling precision as an evaluation metric, noting that it does not adequately measure the fluency, i.e. human playability, of a model's output. To this end, we compare methods across several statistics which track the frequency of adjacent finger predictions that while independently reasonable would be physically challenging to perform in sequence, and implement a reinforcement learning strategy to minimize these as part of our training loss.

Despite the difficulties in MSS due to the high correlation of musical sources in time and frequency, deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to substantial improvements to accomplish this task. For training supervised machine learning models such as DNNs, isolated sources are required. In the case of popular music, one can exploit open-source datasets which involve multitrack recordings of vocals, bass, and drums. For western classical music, however, isolated sources are generally not available. In this article, we consider the case of piano concertos, which are composed for a pianist typically accompanied by an orchestra. The lack of multitrack recordings makes training supervised machine learning models for the separation of piano and orchestra challenging. To overcome this problem, we generate artificial training material by randomly mixing sections of the solo piano repertoire (e.g., piano sonatas) and orchestral pieces without piano (e.g., symphonies) to train state-of-the-art DNN models for MSS.

A key challenge in *melody transcription* is building methods which can handle broad audio containing any number of instrument ensembles and musical styles---existing strategies work well for some melody instruments or styles but not all. To confront this challenge, we leverage representations from Jukebox (Dhariwal et al. 2020), a generative model of broad music audio, thereby improving performance on melody transcription by 20% relative to conventional spectrogram features. Another obstacle in melody transcription is a lack of training data---we derive a new dataset containing 50 hours of melody transcriptions from crowdsourced annotations of broad music. The combination of generative pre-training and a new dataset for this task results in 77% stronger performance on melody transcription relative to the strongest available baseline.

In this work we systematically compare five widely used audio input representations (STFT, CQT, Mel spectrograms, MFCCs, and raw audio waveform) using five established convolutional neural network architectures (MusicCNN, VGG16, ResNet, a Squeeze and Excitation Network (SeNet), as well as a newly proposed MusicCNN variant using dilated convolutions) for the task of music tag prediction. Performance of all factor combinations are measured on two distinct tagging datasets, namely MagnaTagATune and MTG Jamendo. A two-way ANOVA shows that both input representation and model architecture significantly impact the classification results. Despite differently sized input representations and practical impact on model training, we find that using STFT as input representations provides the best results overall and on specific tag categories (genre, instrument, mood), while other representations show less consistent behavior in these regards.

However, most studies merely focus on synthesized sound, and the induced theories on natural tones with complex timbre has rarely been justified. To this end, we investigate both theory and applications of natural-tone loudness perception in this paper via modeling piano tone. The theory part contains: 1) an accurate measurement of piano-tone equal-loudness contour of pitches, and 2) a machine-learning model capable of inferring loudness purely based on spectral features trained on human subject measurements. As for the application, we apply our theory to piano control transfer, in which we adjust the MIDI velocities on two different player pianos (in different acoustic environments) to achieve the same perceptual effect.

A straightforward way is to control a model using different conditions during inference. However, in music practice, conditions are usually sequential (rather than simple categorical labels), involving rich information that overlaps with the learned representation. Consequently, the decoder gets confused about whether to listen to the latent representation or the condition, and sometimes just ignores the condition. To solve this problem, we leverage domain adversarial training to disentangle the representation from condition cues for better control. Specifically, we propose a condition corruption objective that uses the representation to denoise a corrupted condition. Minimized by a discriminator and maximized by the VAE encoder, this objective adversarially induces a condition-invariant representation. In this paper, we focus on the task of melody harmonization to illustrate our idea, while our methodology can be generalized to other controllable generative tasks.

In this work, we present a graph representation of symbolic scores as an intermediate means to solve the cadence detection task. We approach cadence detection as an imbalanced node classification problem using a Graph Convolutional Network. We obtain results that are at least on par with the state of the art, and we present a model capable of making predictions at multiple levels of granularity, from individual notes to beats, thanks to the fine-grained, note-by-note representation. Moreover, our experiments suggest that graph convolution is able to learn non-local features that assist in cadence detection, freeing us from the need of having to devise specialized features that encode non-local context.

Three emotion annotation summarisation methods based on the Arousal/Valence (AV) representation are compared: Emotion Average, Emotion Surface, and Emotion Category. 20 participants (average age: 30.2, 7 females and 13 males from Japan) rated how well generated accompaniments matched melodies (musical coherence) as well as perceived emotions for 75 arrangements corresponding to combinations of models and emotion summarisation methods.

This problem is referred to as domain shift and is commonly approached using domain adaptation (DA) methods. As one relevant scenario, automatic piano transcription algorithms in music learning applications potentially suffer from domain shift since pianos are recorded in different acoustic conditions using various devices. Yet, most currently available datasets for piano transcription only cover ideal recording situations with high-quality microphones. Consequently, a transcription model trained on these datasets will face a mismatch between source and target data in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we employ a recently proposed dataset which includes annotated piano recordings covering typical real-life recording settings for a piano learning application on mobile devices. We first quantify the influence of the domain shift on the performance of a deep learning-based piano multi-pitch estimation (MPE) algorithm.

Understanding how surprisal shapes listeners' preferences for certain musical pieces has implications for music recommender systems, which are typically content- (both acoustic or semantic) or metadata-based. Here we test a recently developed computational algorithm, called Dynamic-Regularity Extraction (D-REX), that uses Bayesian inference to predict the surprisal that humans experience while listening to music.

A computational model of how lyrics are set as melodies is important for automatic composition systems, but an end-to-end lyric-to-melody model would require enormous amounts of paired training data. To mitigate the data constraints, we adopt a two-stage approach, dividing the task into lyric-to-rhythm and rhythm-to-melody modules. However, the lyric-to-rhythm task is still challenging due to its multimodality. In this paper, we propose a novel lyric-to-rhythm framework that includes part-of-speech tags to achieve better text-setting, and a Transformer architecture designed to model long-term syllable-to-note associations. For the rhythm-to-melody task, we adapt a proven chord-conditioned melody Transformer, which has achieved state-of-the-art results. Experiments for Chinese lyric-to-melody generation show that the proposed framework is able to model key characteristics of rhythm and pitch distributions in the dataset, and in a subjective evaluation, the melodies generated by our system were rated as similar to or better than those of a state-of-the-art alternative.",CHN,company,Developing economies,"[22.226112, 20.169771]","[-18.073906, -23.726385]","[-5.2871485, -19.357433, 19.363653]","[-11.476981, -0.47483757, 18.08226]","[9.430091, 10.089876]","[3.2616534, 6.860999]","[13.426928, 8.331683, 0.8362742]","[5.8854375, 9.941182, 11.597447]"

The core idea is to use a pre-trained classifier to constrain the feature space of the discriminator to stabilize and improve GAN training. This paper investigates whether Projected GAN can similarly improve audio generation, by evaluating the performance of a StyleGAN2-based audio-domain loop generation model with and without using a pre-trained feature space in the discriminator.

The work of twelve-tone composers is famously challenging to traditional Western tonal and structural sensibilities; even so, group theoretic approaches have determined that 10% of certain composers' works contain a highly unusual classical symmetry of music. We extend this result by revealing many symmetries that were previously undetected in the works of Schoenberg, Webern, and Berg. Our approach is computational rather than group theoretic, scanning each composition for symmetries of many different cardinalities. Thus, we capture partial symmetries that would be overlooked by more formal means. Moreover, our methods are applicable beyond the narrow scope of twelve-tone composition. We achieve our results by first extending the group-theoretic notion of symmetry to encompass shorter motives that may be repeated and reprised in a given composition, and then comparing the incidence of these symmetries between the work of composers and the space of all possible 12-tone rows.

Contrastive methods are a popular choice for self-supervision in the audio domain, and typically provide a learning signal by forcing the model to be invariant to some transformations of the input. These methods, however, require measures such as negative sampling or some form of regularisation to be taken to prevent the model from collapsing on trivial solutions. In this work, instead of invariance, we propose to use equivariance as a self-supervision signal to learn audio tempo representations from unlabelled data. We derive a simple loss function that prevents the network from collapsing on a trivial solution during training, without requiring any form of regularisation or negative sampling.Our experiments show that it is possible to learn meaningful representations for tempo estimation by solely relying on equivariant self-supervision, achieving performance comparable with supervised methods on several benchmarks.

As this approach enforces phase continuity, SawSing can generate singing voices without the phase-discontinuity glitch of many existing vocoders.

CLMR has shown good performance, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art end-to-end classification models, but it is strictly an encoding framework. It suffers the characteristic limitation of any encoder that it cannot explicitly combine multi-timescale information, whereas a characteristic feature of human audio perception is that we tend to perceive all frequencies simultaneously. To this end, we propose a generalization of CLMR that learns to extract and explicitly combine representations across different frequency resolutions, which we coin the tailed U-Net (TUNe). TUNe architectures combine multi-timescale information during a decoding phase, similar to U-Net architectures used in computer vision and source separation, but have a tail added to reduce sample-level information to a smaller pre-defined number of representation dimensions. The size of the decoding phase is a hyperparameter, and in the case of a zero-layer decoding phase, TUNe reduces to CLMR.

These symbolic features are analyzed in the context of musical information drawn from five other modalities, and experiments are conducted involving two datasets, one small and one large. The results show that, although some feature groups can remain similarly important compared to others, differences can also be evident in various applications, and can depend on the particular classifier and evaluation measure being used.

Modern speech generation pipelines use a vocoder as their final component. Recent vocoder models developed for speech achieve high degree of realism, such that it is natural to wonder how they would perform on music signals. Compared to speech, the heterogeneity and structure of the musical sound texture offers new challenges. In this work we focus on one specific artifact that some vocoder models designed for speech tend to exhibit when applied to music: the perceived instability of pitch when synthesizing sustained notes. We argue that the characteristic sound of this artifact is due to the lack of horizontal phase coherence, which is often the result of using a time-domain target space with a model that is invariant to time-shifts, such as a convolutional neural network. We propose a new vocoder model that is specifically designed for music. Key to improving the pitch stability is the choice of a shift-invariant target space that consists of the magnitude spectrum and the phase gradient. We discuss the reasons that inspired us to re-formulate the vocoder task, outline a working example, and evaluate it on musical signals.

We present three Heirmologic corpora spanning the periods before, during and after the 16th century.

For the analysis of the three corpora, we apply the three methods, namely notational texture, melodic arch similarity, and Jensen-Shannon distances of Markovian models, the second of which is novel and inspired by the idea of melodic arches.

Instrument playing techniques (IPT) play an important role in musical performance.

In this study, we propose an end-to-end Guzheng playing technique detection system using Fully Convolutional Networks that can be applied to variable-length audio. Because each Guzheng playing technique is applied to a note, a dedicated onset detector is trained to divide an audio into several notes and its predictions are fused with frame-wise IPT predictions. During fusion, we add the IPT predictions frame by frame inside each note and get the IPT with the highest probability within each note as the final output of that note. We create a new dataset named GZ_IsoTech from multiple sound banks and real-world recordings for Guzheng performance analysis.

Rethinking Genre Classification,2022,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7342846,"Ke Nie+University of California, San Diego>USA>education","The existing MIR research on genre classification primarily focuses on how to classify a song into the ""correct"" genre while downplaying the fact that genres mutate over time and in response to social change in terms of their musical properties. Songs claiming the same genre can sound very different if they are released years apart, and genres may revive musical traditions from the past. In this paper, I show that the performance of genre classifiers fluctuates as genres evolve. Unsatisfactory performance of the classifiers may not indicate algorithmic flaws but rather the change of genre characteristics. I demonstrate this by studying the case of Chinese Hip-Hop music. Specifically, I collected and analyzed 69,427 songs from four genres (Hip-Hop, Pop, Rock, and Folk) released on a Chinese music platform between 2009 and 2019. Using classifiers trained from the songs in different year cohorts to predict the genre of all the songs, I show how genre classifiers can be used to detect the stylistic shift in Hip-Hop that happened during this period. The paper thus offers a novel, sociological perspective on contending with the much-challenged idea of improving genre classification accuracy for its own sake. However, instead of questioning the effort, I argue that MIR research on genre classification can be helpful for studying genre as a social construct and cultural phenomenon if the pursuit of prediction performance and the cultural meaning of inaccurate prediction are carefully balanced.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-35.620033, -4.621715]","[23.724659, -3.9319417]","[-23.467968, -9.916898, -3.9389932]","[22.181723, -13.915803, 0.24117346]","[13.536846, 11.172152]","[7.3117614, 5.7101526]","[16.365372, 9.50752, -1.9577913]","[7.7708898, 9.464725, 13.345578]"

Former research concluded that the salience of mistakes depended on factors including their contextual appropriateness and a listener's degree of familiarity to what is being performed. A conspicuous error is considered to be an area where there is something obviously wrong with the performance, which a listener can detect regardless of their degree of knowledge of what is being performed. Analogously, this paper attempts to build a score-independent conspicuous error detector for standard piano repertoire of beginner to intermediate students. We gather three qualitatively different piano playing MIDI data: (1) 103 sight-reading sessions for beginning and intermediate adult pianists with formal music training, (2) 245 performances by presumably late-beginner to early-advanced pianists on a digital piano, and (3) 50 etude performances by an advanced pianist. The data was annotated at the regions considered to contain conspicuous mistakes. Then, we use a Temporal Convolutional Network to detect the sites of such mistakes from the piano roll. We investigate the use of two pre-training methods to overcome data scarcity: (1) synthetic data with procedurally-generated mistakes, and (2) training a part of the model as a piano roll auto-encoder. Experimental evaluation shows that the TCN performs at an F-measure of 0.78 without pretraining for sight-reading data, but the proposed pretraining steps improve the F-measure on performance and etude data, approaching the agreement between human raters on conspicuous error labels.

Previous studies on lyrics generation have focused on generating lyrics based on semantic constraints such as specific keywords, lyric style, and topics. However, these methods had limitations because users could not freely input their intentions as text. Even if such intentions can be given as input text, the lyrics generated from the input tend to contain similar wording, making it difficult to inspire the user. Our method is therefore developed to generate lyrics that (1) convey a message similar to the input text and (2) contain wording different from the input text. A straightforward approach of training a text-to-lyrics encoder-decoder is not feasible since there is no text-lyric paired data for this purpose. To overcome this issue, we divide the text-to-lyrics generation process into a two-step pipeline, eliminating the need for text-lyric paired data. (a) First, we use an existing text-to-image generation technique as a text analyzer to obtain an image that captures the meaning of the input text, ignoring the wording. (b) Next, we use our proposed image-to-lyrics encoder-decoder (I2L) to generate lyrics from the obtained image while preserving its meaning.

Meter, the most widespread example of such a temporal scheme, consists of several hierarchically organized pulses. Deviations from isochrony found in musical patterns are considered to form an expressive, micro level of organization that is distinct from the structural macro-organization of the basic pulse. However, polyrhythmic structures, such as those found in music from West Africa or the African diaspora, challenge both the hierarchical subdivision of durations and the structural isochrony of the above models. Here we present a model that integrates the macro- and micro-organization of rhythms by generating non-isochronous girds from isochronous pulses within a polyrhythmic structure. Observed micro-timing patterns may then be generated from structural non-isochronous grids, rather than being understood as expressive deviations from isochrony.

To that end, we leverage transfer learning methods to derive insights about the similarities between the different music cultures to which the data belongs to. We use two Western music datasets, two traditional/folk datasets coming from eastern Mediterranean cultures, and two datasets belonging to Indian art music. Three deep audio embedding models are trained and transferred across domains, including two CNN-based and a Transformer-based architecture, to perform auto-tagging for each target domain dataset.

In this paper, we propose a novel technique for learning MPE without any pitch annotations at all. Our approach exploits multiple recorded versions of a musical piece as surrogate targets. Given one version of a piece as input, we train a network to minimize the distance between its output and time-frequency representations of other versions of that piece.  Since all versions are based on the same musical score, we hypothesize that the learned output corresponds to pitch estimates. To further ensure that this hypothesis holds, we incorporate domain knowledge about overtones and noise levels into the network.

We confirmed that 1) the proposed data augmentation methods were highly effective for training generic Transformer models that generate tokenized outputs, 2) our proposed hybrid CTC-Attention model outperforms conventional methods that transcribe guitar performance with tokens, and 3) the addition of multi-task learning with CTC in our proposed model is especially effective when there is an insufficient amount of training data.",JPN,education,Developed economies,"[48.16703, -1.204527]","[-26.904913, -23.243225]","[13.353867, -16.956938, 11.841836]","[-17.123085, 0.14628796, 5.819716]","[7.9558806, 9.594924]","[3.1246345, 6.8864202]","[12.114701, 8.955363, 0.10529135]","[4.531163, 9.372674, 11.469985]"

These models generally require large amounts of (annotated) training data to achieve high accuracy. Because not all applications in MIR have sufficient quantities of training data, it is becoming increasingly common to transfer models across domains. This approach allows representations derived for one task to be applied to another, and can result in high accuracy with less stringent training data requirements for the downstream task. However, the properties of pre-trained audio embeddings are not fully understood. Specifically, and unlike traditionally engineered features, the representations extracted from pre-trained deep networks may embed and propagate biases from the model's training regime. This work investigates the phenomenon of bias propagation in the context of pre-trained audio representations for the task of instrument recognition. We first demonstrate that three different pre-trained representations (VGGish, OpenL3, and YAMNet) exhibit comparable performance when constrained to a single dataset, but differ in their ability to generalize across datasets (OpenMIC and IRMAS).

We show that the method can robustly detect harmonic similarity between songs, even when reharmonized.  The co-occurrence matrix is computed from a corpus of symbolic jazz-chord progressions, and the result is a map from chords into vectors.

Experiments are performed on a corpus of 932 lead guitar tablatures of popular music and show that a decision tree successfully predicts bend occurrences with an F1 score of 0.71 and a limited amount of false positive predictions, demonstrating promising applications to assist the arrangement of non-guitar music into guitar tablatures.",FRA,education,Developed economies,"[52.821415, -2.528031]","[-21.539343, -11.338825]","[19.263813, -21.361685, 10.585508]","[-13.976438, 2.2047973, 0.074899994]","[7.532818, 9.518093]","[3.62509, 6.2769713]","[11.65906, 9.191762, 0.14519668]","[4.3104086, 9.584387, 12.342888]"

In this work, we address the task of singing voice separation when the ground-truth signals have bleeding and only the target vocals and the corresponding mixture are available. We train a cold diffusion model on the frequency domain to iteratively transform a mixture into the corresponding vocals with bleeding. Next, we build the final separation masks by clustering spectrogram bins according to their evolution along the transformation steps. We test our approach on a Carnatic music scenario for which solely datasets with bleeding exist, while current research on this repertoire commonly uses source separation models trained solely with Western commercial music.

To faithfully encode such relations, we need an elegant way to represent both the semantics of prolongation, where a single event is elaborated into multiple events, and process, where the connection from one event to another is elaborated into multiple connections. In existing works, trees are used to capture the former and graphs for the latter. Each such model has the potential to either encode relations between events (e.g., an event being a repetition of another), or relations between processes (e.g., two consecutive steps making up a larger skip), but not both together explicitly. To model meaningful relations between musical events and processes and combine the semantic expressiveness of trees and graphs, we propose a structured representation using  algebraic datatype (ADT) with dependent type. We demonstrate its applications towards encoding functional interpretations of harmonic progressions, and large scale organizations of key regions. This paper offers two contributions.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach named Harana, to jointly detect the labels and boundaries of harmonic regions using neural semi-CRF (conditional random field). In contrast to rule-based scores used in traditional semi-CRF, a neural score function is proposed to incorporate features with more representational power.

A typical and recent approach to this is to learn, via deep neural networks, a joint embedding space that correlates short fixed-size snippets of audio and sheet music by means of an appropriate similarity structure. However, two challenges that arise out of this strategy are the requirement of strongly aligned data to train the networks, and the inherent discrepancies of musical content between audio and sheet music snippets caused by local and global tempo deviations. In this paper, we address these two shortcomings by designing a cross-modal recurrent network that learns joint embeddings that can summarize longer passages of corresponding audio and sheet music. The benefits of our method are that it only requires weakly aligned audio - sheet music pairs, as well as that the recurrent network handles the non-linearities caused by tempo variations between audio and sheet music.

FlexDTW allows alignment paths to start anywhere on the bottom or left edge of the cost matrix (adjacent to the origin) and to end anywhere on the top or right edge.  In order to properly compare paths of very different lengths, we use a goodness measure that normalizes the cumulative path cost by the path length.  The key insight of FlexDTW is that the Manhattan length of a path can be computed by simply knowing the starting point of the path, which can be computed recursively during dynamic programming.  We artificially generate a suite of 16 benchmarks based on the Chopin Mazurka dataset in order to characterize audio alignment performance under a variety of boundary conditions.

Both composers and listeners continuously assessed the emotional valence of the music clips on a 9-point scale (1: 'very negative' to 9: 'very positive'). Linear mixed-effect models analysis revealed that listeners significantly perceived the composers' intended emotions. Regarding audio features, the RMS was found to modulate the degree to which the listener's perceived emotion resembled the composer's emotion across all emotions. Moreover, the significant audio features that influenced this relationship varied depending on the emotion type. We propose that audio features related to the emotional responses of composers-listeners can be considered key factors in predicting listeners' emotional responses.",KOR,education,Developing economies,"[-57.72899, 2.7891006]","[40.435104, -29.173584]","[-25.011526, 7.3342943, -18.911184]","[14.963555, 17.329098, 12.721543]","[15.777561, 12.015185]","[9.122004, 7.0996]","[18.47404, 10.0575285, 0.4149087]","[9.057195, 8.433716, 12.225411]"

These periodicities are visualized with bar graphs known as metric weight and spectral weight profiles. Analyzing these profiles for the presence of syncopation has thus far required manual inspection. In this paper, we propose a simple measure using chi-squared distance for quantifying the level of syncopation found in IMA weight profiles by considering each as a distribution to be compared against (1) a uniform distribution 'nominal' weight profile, and (2) a non-uniform distribution based on beat strength. We apply this measure to the task of predicting perceptual ratings of syncopation using the Song (2014) dataset of 111 single-bar rhythmic patterns and compare its performance to seven existing models of syncopation/complexity. Our results indicate that the proposed measure based on (1) achieves a moderately high Spearman rank correlation (rs = 0.80) to all ratings and is the only single measure that reportedly works across all categories.

First, SpecMaskGIT synthesizes a realistic 10 s audio clip in less than 16 iterations, an order of magnitude less than previous iterative TTA methods.

Next, built upon a latent space of Mel-spectrograms, SpecMaskGIT has a wider range of applications (e.g., zero-shot bandwidth extension) than similar methods built on latent wave domains.

In this paper, we solve the above problems by introducing new symbolic music representation with MusicLang chord analysis model. We propose our MMT-BERT architecture adapting to the representation. To build a robust multitrack music generator, we fine-tune a pre-trained MusicBERT model to serve as the discriminator, and incorporate relativistic standard loss.

Some fear that the adoption of AI is poised to result in massive job destruction; others sense it will jeopardize and eventually upend all legal frameworks of intellectual property. AI, however, is not the first instance where humanity has confronted the prospect of machines emulating musical creativity. Already in the Baroque, various modes of musical artificiality were explored, ranging from automata and organ stops mimicking human performance and natural sounds, up to devices for mechanized composition (e.g., Athanasius Kircher, Johann Philip Kirnberger, C.P.E. Bach, Antonio Calegari and Diederich Nickolaus Winkel). Valuable insights emerge from the reconsideration—and digital implementation—of these curiosities through the lens of present-day generative models. It can be argued that the very notion of 'artificiality' has presented humanity with long-standing philosophical dilemmas, in addressing the debate on the role of art as a substitute of (divine) nature.

Existing approaches mainly employ supervised learning and the training demands strongly-aligned and paired song-to-piano data, which is built by remapping piano notes to song audio.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a transfer learning approach that pre-trains our model on piano-only data and fine-tunes it on weakly-aligned paired data constructed without note remapping. During pre-training, to guide the model to learn piano composition concepts instead of merely transcribing audio, we use an existing lead sheet transcription model as the encoder to extract high-level features from the piano recordings. The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on the paired song-piano data to transfer the learned composition knowledge to the pop song domain.

We present a methodology based on training a neural model with synthetic images, thus reducing the difficulty of obtaining labeled data.

The main reasons we argue are due to the lack of data and technical difficulties arise from diverse acoustic conditions and unique properties of choral singing. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a Transformer-based framework for note-level transcription of choral music. This framework bypasses the frame-level processing and directly produces a sequence of notes with associated timestamps. We also introduce YouChorale, a novel choral music dataset in a cappella setting curated from the Internet. YouChorale contains 452 real-world recordings in diverse acoustic configurations of choral music from over 100 composers as well as their MIDI scores.

The computational base for MSA is a spectro-temporal representation of input audio such as the spectrogram, where the compositional relationships of the spectral components provide valuable clues (e.g., chords) to the identification of structural units. However, such implicit features might be vulnerable to local operations such as convolution and pooling operations. In this paper, we hypothesize that the self-attention over the spectral domain as well as the temporal domain plays a key role in tackling MSA. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a novel MSA model built on the Transformer-in-Transformer architecture that alternately stacks spectral and temporal self-attention layers. Experiments with the Beatles, RWC, and SALAMI datasets showed the superiority of the dual-aspect self-attention. In particular, the differentiation between spectral and temporal self-attentions can provide extra performance gain.

The problem of generating tablature from a symbolic music representation involves inferring this string and fret assignment per note across an entire composition or performance. On the guitar, multiple string-fret assignments are possible for most pitches, which leads to a large combinatorial space that prevents exhaustive search approaches. Most modern methods use constraint-based dynamic programming to minimize some cost function (e.g. hand position movement). In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning solution to symbolic guitar tablature estimation. We train an encoder-decoder Transformer model in a masked language modeling paradigm to assign notes to strings.

The main limitation to applying deep learning in this domain is the absence of a large, high-quality, labeled dataset containing both positive and negative pairs. To address this, we synthesize high-quality audio from multi-track MIDI datasets containing independent instrument stems, and then extract loops to serve as positive pairs. This provides models with instrument-level information when learning compatibility.

In this paper, we present a data generation framework for rich music discovery dialogue using a large language model (LLM) and user intents, system actions, and musical attributes. This is done by i) dialogue intent analysis using grounded theory, ii) generating attribute sequences via cascading database filtering, and iii) generating utterances using large language models. By applying this framework to the Million Song dataset, we create – LP-MusicDialog, a Large Language Model based Pseudo Music Dialogue dataset, containing over 288k music conversations using more than 319k music items.

In this framework, all events (notes or pedals) are represented as closed time intervals tied to specific event types. The neural semi-CRF approach requires an interval scoring matrix that assigns a score for every candidate interval. However, designing an efficient and expressive architecture for scoring intervals is not trivial. This paper introduces a simple method for scoring intervals using scaled inner product operations that resemble how attention scoring is done in transformers. We show theoretically that, due to the special structure from encoding the non-overlapping intervals, under a mild condition, the inner product operations are expressive enough to represent an ideal scoring matrix that can yield the correct transcription result. We then demonstrate that an encoder-only non-hierarchical transformer backbone, operating only on a low-time-resolution feature map, is capable of transcribing piano notes and pedals with high accuracy and time precision.

In this paper, I investigate how statistical regularities in rhythmic patterns can be used to determine how to compare pieces at different tempos, speculating that these regularities could relate to the perception of tactus. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, I model first-order (two-gram) rhythmic event transitions in a symbolic dataset of rap transcriptions (MCFlow), allowing the model to renotate the rhythmic values of each transcription as needed to optimize fit.

Of the very few current systems that support source separation beyond this setup, most continue to rely on an inflexible decoder setup that can only support a fixed pre-defined set of stems. Increasing stem support in these inflexible systems correspondingly requires increasing computational complexity, rendering extensions of these systems computationally infeasible for long-tail instruments. We propose Banquet, a system that allows source separation of multiple stems using just one decoder. A bandsplit source separation model is extended to work in a query-based setup in tandem with a music instrument recognition PaSST model. On the MoisesDB dataset, Banquet — at only 24.9 M trainable parameters — performed on par with or better than the significantly more complex 6-stem Hybrid Transformer Demucs. The query-based setup allows for the separation of narrow instrument classes such as clean acoustic guitars, and can be successfully applied to the extraction of less common stems such as reeds and organs.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[5.3355346, -50.77312]","[-48.638218, -12.002572]","[5.264396, -28.179832, -10.885471]","[-31.36577, -5.903363, -4.0532093]","[8.686908, 11.753714]","[1.368799, 6.1511946]","[13.353551, 10.433558, -1.1931714]","[4.779919, 11.467509, 11.53546]"

Aiming to steer the development of future models, we identify the most common errors from training and testing on the aforementioned crowdsourced datasets. We perform this study in three steps: First, we detail the quality of the transcription for each class of interest; second, we employ a new metric and a pseudo confusion matrix to quantify different mistakes in the estimations; last, we compute the agreement between different annotators of the same track to estimate the accuracy of the ground-truth. Our findings are twofold: On the one hand, we observe that the previously reported issue that less represented instruments (e.g., toms) are less reliably transcribed is mostly solved now.

Furthermore, in recent years, MAESTRO has become the de-facto training and evaluation dataset for such models. However, inference performance has been observed to deteriorate substantially when applied on out-of-distribution data, thereby questioning the suitability and reliability of transcribed outputs from such models for specific MIR tasks.

Results of labeling, tagging, assessment, and evaluation can be used as training data for machine learning models that estimate them automatically. For such machine learning purposes, a single target (e.g., song) is usually annotated by multiple human annotators, and the results are aggregated by majority voting or averaging. Majority voting, however, requires the number of annotators to be an odd number, which is not always possible. And averaging is sensitive to differences in the judgmental characteristics of each annotator and cannot be used for ordinal scales. This paper therefore proposes that the item response theory (IRT) be used to aggregate the music annotation results of multiple annotators. IRT-based models can jointly estimate annotators' characteristics and latent scores (i.e., aggregations of annotation results) of the targets, and they are also applicable to ordinal scales.

As an alternative, we propose a workflow and interface that allows users to quickly annotate jumps (by clicking on repeat signs), requiring a small amount of human supervision but yielding much higher quality alignments on average. Additionally, we refine audio and score feature representations to improve alignment quality by: (1) integrating measure detection into the score feature representation, and (2) using raw onset prediction probabilities from a music transcription model instead of piano roll. We propose an evaluation protocol for audio-to-score alignment that computes the distance between the estimated and ground truth alignment in units of measures.

After removing vocals from the recordings with a deep learning source separation technique, we further process the instrumental segments using non-negative matrix factorization and select the bell components. Then, we compute a tempo-agnostic rhythmic feature from the bell track and use it to cluster the data. Finally, we use synthesized patterns from the musicological literature about Candomblé as references to propagate labels to the rhythmic clusters in our data. This semi-supervised approach to pattern analysis precludes the need for downbeat and cycle annotations, making it particularly suited for extensive archive investigations.

Similarly to Driedger et al.'s ""musaicing"" (or ""audio mosaicing"") technique, we concatenate a set number of windows within a corpus of audio to re-create the harmonic and percussive aspects of a target audio stream. Unlike Driedger's NMF-based technique, however, we instead use an explicitly Bayesian point of view, where corpus window indices are hidden states and the target audio stream is an observation. We use a particle filter to infer the best hidden corpus states in real-time. Our transition model includes a tunable parameter to control the time-continuity of corpus grains, and our observation model allows users to prioritize how quickly windows change to match the target. Because the computational complexity of the system is independent of the corpus size, our system scales to corpora that are hours long, which is an important feature in the age of vast audio data collections. Within The Concatenator module itself, composers can vary grain length, fit to target, and pitch shift in real time while reacting to the sounds they hear, enabling them to rapidly iterate ideas.

While the importance of temporal alignment varies across different contexts, achieving precise temporal synchronization is a prominent goal in musical performances. Musicians often incorporate expressive timing variations, which require precise control over timing and synchronization, particularly in ensemble performance. This is crucial because both deliberate expressive nuances and accidental timing deviations can affect the overall timing of a performance. This discussion prompts the question of how musicians adjust their temporal dynamics to achieve synchronization within an ensemble. This paper introduces a novel feedback correction model based on the Kalman Filter, aimed at improving the understanding of interpersonal timing in ensemble music performances.

Training a model in this manner allows its use in estimating stem compatibility—retrieving, aligning, or generating a stem to match a given mix—or for downstream tasks such as genre or key estimation, as the training paradigm requires the model to learn information related to timbre, harmony, and rhythm. We evaluate our model's performance on a retrieval task on the MUSDB18 dataset, testing its ability to find the missing stem from a mix and through a subjective user study.

Although text-to-music generation is getting largely adopted by the general public, explicit control and example-based style transfer are more adequate modalities to capture the intents of artists and musicians. In this paper, we aim to unify explicit control and style transfer within a single model by separating local and global information to capture musical structure and timbre respectively. To do so, we leverage the capabilities of diffusion autoencoders to extract semantic features, in order to build two representation spaces. We enforce disentanglement between those spaces using an adversarial criterion and a two-stage training strategy.

Historical records, including manuscripts, research papers, and oral traditions, confirm Saint Yared's establishment of three canonical EOTC chanting modes during the 6th century. This paper attempts to investigate the EOTC chants using music information retrieval (MIR) techniques. Among the research questions regarding the analysis and understanding of EOTC chants, Yaredawi YeZema Silt, namely the mode of chanting adhering to Saint Yared's standards, is of primary importance. Therefore, we consider the task of Yaredawi YeZema Silt classification in EOTC chants by introducing a new dataset and showcasing a series of classification experiments for this task. Results show that using the distribution of stabilized pitch contours as the feature representation on a simple neural-network-based classifier becomes an effective solution. The musicological implications and insights of such results are further discussed through a comparative study with the previous ethnomusicology literature on EOTC chants. By making this dataset publicly accessible, our aim is to promote future exploration and analysis of EOTC chants and highlight potential directions for further research, thereby fostering a deeper understanding and preservation of this unique spiritual and cultural heritage.",TWN,education,Developing economies,"[-18.035301, -18.923616]","[-2.5392694, -8.93365]","[-1.5770165, 0.021586105, -20.72555]","[-4.1441584, 1.5975175, 13.360534]","[11.351428, 11.278794]","[4.430323, 4.960347]","[15.136576, 8.419206, 0.9068481]","[5.281681, 9.699648, 13.623995]"

However, the control power of text controls on music is intrinsically limited, as they can only describe music indirectly through meta-data (such as singers and instruments) or high-level representations (such as genre and emotion). We aim to further equip the models with direct and content-based controls on innate music languages such as pitch, chords and drum track. To this end, we contribute Coco-Mulla, a content-based control method for music large language modeling.

Self-supervised pre-training is therefore a promising avenue for improving performance on these tasks, especially because, in learning a task like predicting masked notes, a model may acquire latent representations of music theory concepts like keys and chords. However, existing models for roman numeral analysis have not used pretraining, instead training from scratch on labeled data, while conversely, pretrained models for music understanding have generally been applied to sequence-level tasks requiring little explicit music theory, such as composer classification. In contrast, this paper applies pretraining methods to a music theory task by fine-tuning a masked language model, MusicBERT, for roman numeral analysis. We apply token classification to get a chord label for each note and then aggregate the predictions of simultaneous notes to achieve a single label at each time step. The resulting model substantially outperforms previous roman numeral analysis models.

However, existing systems for mixing style transfer are limited in that they often operate only on a fixed number of tracks, introduce artifacts, and produce mixes in an end-to-end fashion, without grounding in traditional audio effects, prohibiting interpretability and controllability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Diff-MST, a framework comprising a differentiable mixing console, a transformer controller, and an audio production style loss function. By inputting raw tracks and a reference song, our model estimates control parameters for audio effects within a differentiable mixing console, producing high-quality mixes and enabling post-hoc adjustments. Moreover, our architecture supports an arbitrary number of input tracks without source labelling, enabling real-world applications. We evaluate our model's performance against robust baselines and showcase the effectiveness of our approach, architectural design, tailored audio production style loss, and innovative training methodology for the given task. We provide code and listening examples online.",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[28.038641, -14.027369]","[-33.275703, -34.367336]","[-0.7534243, -27.39936, 2.7482703]","[-24.413992, 2.9004593, 13.677672]","[9.000017, 10.519093]","[3.0021396, 7.967499]","[13.311474, 9.262039, -0.28275424]","[4.8421736, 9.254883, 10.6380415]"
