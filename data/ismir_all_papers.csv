Brown+University of Waterloo>CAN>education,"We study the impact of the presence of lyrics on music mood perception for both Canadian and Chinese listeners by conducting a user study of Canadians not of Chinese origin, Chinese-Canadians, and Chinese people who have lived in Canada for fewer than three years. While our original hypotheses were largely connected to cultural components of mood perception, we also analyzed how stable mood assignments were when listeners could read the lyrics of recent popular English songs they were hearing versus when they only heard the songs. We also showed the lyrics of some songs to participants without playing the recorded music. We conclude that people assign different moods to the same song in these three scenarios. People tend to assign a song to the mood cluster that includes “melancholy” more often when they read the lyrics without listening to it, and having access to the lyrics does not help reduce the difference in music mood perception between Canadian and Chinese listeners significantly. Our results cause us to question the idea that songs have “inherent mood”. Rather, we suggest that the mood depends on both cultural and experiential context.",CAN,education,Developed economies,"[53.423794, 9.334391]","[22.15455, 44.90381]","[9.204252, 25.371681, -13.159601]","[31.079086, 4.8100176, 18.627697]","[14.551972, 11.541909]","[4.2909646, 5.3676243]","[13.508952, 16.572449, 3.8798807]","[3.569485, 3.772377, 1.0774649]"

In this paper, we investigate this research problem by a comparative study on the performance of features extracted from the magnitude spectrum, cepstrum and phase derivatives such as group-delay function (GDF) and instantaneous frequency deviation (IFD) for classifying the playing techniques of electric guitar recordings. We consider up to 7 distinct playing techniques of electric guitar and create a new individual-note dataset comprising of 7 types of guitar tones for each playing technique. The dataset contains 6,580 clips and 11,928 notes. Our evaluation shows that sparse coding is an effective means of mining useful patterns from the primitive time-frequency representations and that combining the sparse representations of logarithm cepstrum, GDF and IFD leads to the highest average F-score of 71.7%. Moreover, from analyzing the confusion matrices we find that cepstral and phase features are particularly important in discriminating highly similar techniques such as pull-off, hammer-on and bending.

There is an increasing need for such datasets, because the shift from physical to digital distribution in the music industry has given the listener access to a large body of music, which needs to be cataloged efficiently and be easily browsable. Additionally, deep learning and feature learning techniques are becoming increasingly popular for music information retrieval applications, and they typically require large amounts of training data to work well. In this paper, we propose to exploit an available large-scale music dataset, the Million Song Dataset (MSD), for classification tasks on other datasets, by reusing models trained on the MSD for feature extraction. This transfer learning approach, which we refer to as supervised pre-training, was previously shown to be very effective for computer vision problems. We show that features learned from MSD audio fragments in a supervised manner, using tag labels and user listening data, consistently outperform features learned in an unsupervised manner in this setting, provided that the learned feature extractor is of limited complexity.

However, in many of the available MIDI files the musical beat and tempo information is set to a preset value with no relation to the actual music content. In this paper, we introduce a procedure to determine the musical beat grid from a given performed MIDI file. As one main contribution, we show how the global estimate of the time signature can be used to correct local errors in the pulse grid estimation. Different to MIDI quantization, where one tries to map MIDI note onsets onto a given musical pulse grid, our goal is to actually estimate such a grid.

The resulting model is tested by predicting note velocity for unseen performances. Our approach differs from earlier work in a number of ways: (1) an additional input representation based on a local history of velocity values is used, (2) the RBMs are trained to result in a network with sparse activations, (3) network connectivity is increased by adding skip-connections, and (4) more data is used for training.

To establish a link between different versions, automatic music alignment methods map each position in one version to a corresponding position in another version. Due to the leeway in interpreting a piece, any two versions can differ significantly, for example, in terms of local tempo, articulation, or playing style. For a given pair of versions, these differences can be significant such that even state-of-the-art methods fail to identify a correct alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that increases the robustness for difficult to align cases. Instead of aligning only pairs of versions as done in previous methods, our method aligns multiple versions in a joint manner. This way, the alignment can be computed by comparing each version not only with one but with several versions, which stabilizes the comparison and leads to an increase in alignment robustness. Using recordings from the Mazurka Project, the alignment error for our proposed method was 14% lower on average compared to a state-of-the-art method, with significantly less outliers (standard deviation 53% lower).",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[-22.970377, 15.500472]","[4.0405445, -35.03149]","[4.112271, -14.313726, 10.939695]","[-1.9901625, -10.451116, -5.7495675]","[10.58871, 6.920407]","[10.116922, 0.8035274]","[11.413271, 14.048784, -0.38837156]","[9.105613, 2.6055384, 1.5920333]"

In our proposed approach, we make use of association analysis to study and predict music genres based on the acoustic features extracted directly from music. In essence, we build an associative classifier, which finds inherent associations between content-based features and individual genres and then uses them to predict the genre(s) of a new music piece. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a series of experiments using two publicly available music datasets. One of them is the largest available in MIR and contains real world data, while the other has been widely used and provides a good benchmarking basis. We show the effectiveness of our approach and discuss various related issues.

A significant advantage of Verovio is that it implements MEI’s structure internally, making it the best suited solution for rendering features that make MEI unique. Verovio is designed as a fast, portable, lightweight tool written in pure standard C++ with no dependencies on third-party frameworks or libraries. It can be used as a command-line rendering tool, as a library, or it can be compiled to JavaScript using the Emscripten LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler. This last option is particularly interesting because it provides a complete in-browser music MEI typesetter. The SVG output from Verovio is organized in such a way that the MEI structure is preserved as much as possible. Since every graphic in SVG is an XML element that is easily addressable, Verovio is particularly well-suited for interactive applications, especially in web browsers.

The incompleteness of data can hamper some important tasks, such as music and artist recommendation. In this scenario, transductive classification can be used to classify the whole dataset considering just few labeled instances. Usually transductive classification is performed through label propagation, in which data are represented as networks and the examples propagate their labels through their connections. Similarity-based networks are usually applied to model data as network. However, this kind of representation requires the definition of parameters, which significantly affect the classification accuracy, and presents a high cost due to the computation of similarities among all dataset instances. In contrast, bipartite heterogeneous networks have appeared as an alternative to similarity-based networks in text mining applications. In these networks, the words are connected to the documents which they occur. Thus, there is no parameter or additional costs to generate such networks. In this paper, we propose the use of the bipartite network representation to perform transductive classification of music, using a bag-of-frames approach to describe music signals.

In this paper, we present a note-level music transcription system, which is built on a state-of-the-art frame-level multi-pitch estimation (MPE) system. Preliminary note-level transcription achieved by connecting pitch estimates into notes often lead to many spurious notes due to MPE errors. In this paper, we propose to address this problem by randomly sampling notes in the preliminary note-level transcription. Each sample is a subset of all notes and is viewed as a note-level transcription candidate. We evaluate the likelihood of each candidate using the MPE model, and select the one with the highest likelihood as the final transcription. The likelihood treats notes in a transcription as a whole and favors transcriptions with less spurious notes. Experiments conducted on 110 pieces of J.S.

Automatic drum transcription has to date been tackled by recognising individual drums or drum combinations.

We combine these two approaches by classifying bar-level drum patterns on sub-beat quantised timbre features using support vector machines. We train the classifier using synthesised audio and carry out a series of experiments to evaluate our approach. Using six different drum kits, we show that the classifier generalises to previously unseen drum kits when trained on the other five (80% accuracy). Measures of precision and recall show that even for incorrectly classified patterns many individual drum events are correctly transcribed. Tests on 14 acoustic performances from the ENST-Drums dataset indicate that the system generalises to real-world recordings.

A main problem of this task is that the query is often buried in mixture signals consisting of various instruments. To solve this problem, we propose a method that can appropriately calculate the distance between a query and partial components of a musical piece. More specifically, gamma process nonnegative matrix factorization (GaP-NMF) is used for decomposing the spectrogram of the query into an appropriate number of basis spectra and their activation patterns. Semi-supervised GaP-NMF is then used for estimating activation patterns of the learned basis spectra in the musical piece by presuming the piece to partially consist of those spectra.

Those methods, however, cannot distinguish latent musical structures common to all performances and temporal dynamics unique to each performance. To solve this problem, our model explicitly represents two state sequences: a top-level sequence that determines the common structure inherent in the music itself and a bottom-level sequence that determines the actual temporal fluctuation of each performance. These two sequences are fused into a hierarchical Bayesian HMM and can be learned at the same time from the given performances. Since the top-level sequence assigns the same state for note combinations that repeatedly appear within a piece of music, we can unveil the latent structure of the piece.

Keyword spotting is a well-researched task on pure speech, but state-of-the-art approaches cannot be easily transferred to singing because phoneme durations have much higher variations in singing. To our knowledge, no keyword spotting system for singing has been presented yet. We present a keyword spotting approach based on keyword-filler Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and test it on a-capella singing and spoken lyrics. We test Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Perceptual Linear Predictive Features (PLPs), and Temporal Patterns (TRAPs) as front ends. These features are then used to generate phoneme posteriors using Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on speech data. The phoneme posteriors are then used as the system input. Our approach produces useful results on a-capella singing, but depend heavily on the chosen keyword. We show that results can be further improved by training the MLP on a-capella data. We also test two post-processing methods on our phoneme posteriors before the keyword spotting step. First, we average the posteriors of all three feature sets. Second, we run the three concatenated posteriors through a fusion classifier.",DEU,facility,Developed economies,"[2.0654407, -40.656555]","[-17.655111, -34.754833]","[-13.2118845, -12.606233, -19.511631]","[1.208833, 9.3728485, -22.303179]","[8.575389, 11.632389]","[9.576416, 5.3290105]","[8.571659, 15.035123, 0.65997326]","[8.005901, 5.450768, 1.1993759]"

Singer specific dictionaries learned from available polyphonic recordings provide the soft mask that effectively attenuates the bleeding-through of accompanying melodic instruments typical of purely harmonic-sinusoidal model based separation. The dictionary learning uses NMF optimization across a training set of mixed signal utterances while keeping the vocal signal bases constant across the utterances.

We present a context-aware music prediction system focusing on expressive timing: a Bayesian network that incorporates stylistic model selection and linear conditional gaussian distributions on variables representing proportional tempo change. The system can be trained using rehearsals of distributed or co-located ensembles. We evaluate the model by comparing its prediction accuracy to two others: one employing only linear conditional dependencies between expressive timing nodes but no stylistic clustering, and one using only independent distributions for timing changes. The three models are tested on performances of a custom-composed piece that is played ten times, each in one of two styles. The results are promising, with the proposed system outperforming the other two. In predictable parts of the performance, the system with conditional dependencies and stylistic clustering achieves errors of 15ms; in more difficult sections, the errors rise to 100ms; and, in unpredictable sections, the error is too great for seamless timing emulation.

Performance falls off for all submissions as the vocabularies increase in complexity, but does it do so directly in proportion to the number of more complex chords, or are certain algorithms indeed more robust? What are the outliers, song-algorithm pairs where the performance was substantially higher or lower than would be predicted, and how can they be explained?

For example, the word “tears” can appear not only in sad songs (e.g., feel heartrending), but also in happy songs (e.g., weep for joy). To overcome this limitation, we propose to automatically analyze and visualize topics of lyrics by using a well-known text analysis method called latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). This enables LyricsRadar to offer two types of topic visualization. One is the topic radar chart that visualizes the relative weights of five latent topics of each song on a pentagon-shaped chart. The other is radar-like arrangement of all songs in a two-dimensional space in which song lyrics having similar topics are arranged close to each other.

One problem is that the computed components are often not of purely harmonic or percussive nature but also contain noise-like sounds that are neither clearly harmonic nor percussive. Furthermore, depending on the parameter settings, one often can observe a leakage of harmonic sounds into the percussive component and vice versa. In this paper we present two extensions to a state-of-the-art harmonic-percussive separation procedure to target these problems. First, we introduce a separation factor parameter into the decomposition process that allows for tightening separation results and for enforcing the components to be clearly harmonic or percussive.

One approach is for human listeners to judge performance by listening to beat times mixed as clicks with music signals. The more common alternative is to compare beat times against ground truth annotations via one or more of the many objective evaluation measures. However, despite a large body of work in audio beat tracking, there is currently no consensus over which evaluation measure(s) to use, meaning multiple accuracy scores are typically reported. In this paper, we seek to evaluate the evaluation measures by examining the relationship between objective accuracy scores and human judgements of beat tracking performance. First, we present the raw correlation between objective scores and subjective ratings, and show that evaluation measures which allow alternative metrical levels appear more correlated than those which do not. Second, we explore the effect of parameterisation of objective evaluation measures, and demonstrate that correlation is maximised for smaller tolerance windows than those currently used.

Universitat Pompeu Fabra>ESP>education;Pedro Cano+Audiovisual Institute. Universitat Pompeu Fabra>ESP>education,"Music information retrieval has become a major topic in the last few years and we can find a wide range of applications that use it. For this reason, audio databases start growing in size as more and more digital audio resources have become available. However, the usefulness of an audio database relies not only on its size but also on its organization and structure. Therefore, much effort must be spent in the labeling process whose complexity grows with database size and diversity.

In this paper we introduce a new audio classification tool and we use its properties to develop an automatic system to segment audio material in a fully unsupervised way. The audio segments obtained with this process are automatically labeled in a way that two segments with similar psychoacoustics properties get the same label. By doing so, the audio signal is automatically segmented into a sequence of abstract acoustic events. This is specially useful to classify huge multimedia databases where a human driven segmentation is not practicable. This automatic classification allow a fast indexing and retrieval of audio fragments. This audio segmentation is done using competitive hidden Markov models as the main classification engine and, thus, no previous classified or hand-labeled data is needed. This powerful classification tool also has a great flexibility and offers the possibility to customize the matching criterion as well as the average segment length according to the application needs.

The first stage in a classification system is the parameterization part where some features are obtained from the raw audio signal. The aim of this parameterization stage is to calculate a set of values that represent the main characteristics of the audio samples. The nature of the parameterization is strongly dependent on the application since it will determine the set of abstract acoustic units and, therefore, the underlying structure of a certain sound. The main classification engine in our system is based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). HMMs have proven to be a very powerful tool to statistically model a process that varies in time. The idea behind them is very simple. Consider a stochastic process from an unknown source and we only have access to its output in time. HMMs are well suited to model this kind of events. From this point of view, HMMs can be seen as a doubly embedded stochastic process with a process that is not observable (hidden process) and can only be observed through another stochastic process (observable process) that produces the time set of observations. However, after examining the audio segmentation problem, we can see that usual HMM training is completely useless because we do not have a priori information about the segmentation. In traditional HMM the training procedure uses a labeled observation sequence and parameter estimation is based on learning from examples. For example, in speech recognition, the training database is labeled with the phonemes of the speech sequences. By doing so, HMMs learn from examples of each phoneme and they use this knowledge to identify similar patterns in the recognition stage. But the problem we are dealing with in automatic music segmentation is very different (and by far more difficult). Our main goal is to blindly identify similar (in some sense) audio segments and therefore we do not have any previous knowledge to train traditional HMMs. Thus, this is clearly an example of HMMs unsupervised training. Competitive Hidden Markov Models have proved to be specially well suited for this kind of situations. CoHMM are different to HMM mainly in the training stage since the recognition stage (or classification) shares the common algorithm. In this paper we also show some results that prove that coHMM converge to a realistic segmentation architecture.",ESP,education,Developed economies,"[-1.8133887, 2.2956107]","[-2.9602537, -21.848625]","[3.8422558, -6.0078263, 6.0330544]","[0.87404114, 5.328463, -4.6801586]","[10.229755, 9.374138]","[9.617529, 3.5373154]","[10.221348, 14.860114, 0.6146637]","[8.046991, 4.27141, -0.8595616]"

On the contrary, it is “active” and based on a set of interactions between listeners and musical documents—including automatic music information research and extraction—so as to discover intentions. This recognition process is based on the observation of regularities and rules, in order to build “forms” from all indications, information and redundancies. The listener interprets all the signs that are meaningful for him as intentions, attributed to the composer. Features of computer assisted listening Let us specify further the active listening situation for the musicologist, taking for example the consultation of a document in such a digital library as IRCAM’s. The musicologist is facing a computer screen, while handling scores and books. This terminal allows him, among many other possibilities, to listen to music, to access musical data bases and hypermedia analyses. The musicologist is handling several devices on several media at the same time. First of all, the listener needs a framework that takes him/her into account. The purpose is to set the conditions of possibility of listening by restricting the heuristics of “forms”. It is therefore necessary to set a listening framework for the musicologist, to assist him in discovering the “intentions” of music. The main feature of this listening environment is thus its capacity to enable its user to vary the music representation. In the same way that working on a musical piece leads us either to read it silently or to sol-fa, or to hum it, or to play it, the musicologist’s environment must enable rapid changes of the representation of abstract objects. This is very important: a critical part of the analysis work consists in associating varied representations and contexts. Its purpose is the emergence of meaning from numerous and dissimilar elements that views imagined by the musicologist manage to reconcile. Musical databases help weave these links. In such an environment as the IRCAM Digital Library, we can either: •= associate various representations of music: hypermedia analyses offer sonograms as well as scores or formal schemes. •= or associate various contexts: the musicologist can easily know which works are contemporary with the Marteau sans Maître by Boulez using roughly the same instruments, or explore the musical production of the year 1954.",FRA,facility,Developed economies,"[23.481817, 32.479733]","[29.185156, 36.364925]","[28.718699, 7.197683, -5.6730113]","[2.1715255, -0.15136693, 30.614685]","[13.519064, 8.604864]","[4.7131777, 2.247306]","[12.388343, 16.57178, 0.95039225]","[5.020108, 2.3696399, 0.7784584]"

There has been some research to improve the interface either for pull applications, e.g. query-by-humming systems, or for push applications, e.g. collaborative-filtering-based or feature-based music recommendation systems. However, for content-based search or feature-based filtering systems, one important problem is to describe music by its parameters or features, so that search engines or information filtering agents can use them to measure the similarity of the target (user’s query or preference) and the candidates. MPEG7 (formally called “Multimedia Content Description Interface”) is an international standard, which describes the multimedia content data to allow universal indexing, retrieval, filtering, control, and other activities supported by rich metadata. However, the metadata about the multimedia content itself are still insufficient, because many features of multimedia content are quite perceptual and user-dependent. For example, emotional features are very important for multimedia retrieval, but they are hard to be described by a universal model since different users may have different emotional responses to the same multimedia content. We therefore turn to user modeling techniques and representations to describe the properties of each user, so that the retrieval will be more accurate. Besides, user modeling can be used to reduce the search space, make push service easier and improve the user interface. There are several important issues in user modeling for music information retrieval purpose or even more general multimedia retrieval. 1) How to model the user? User-programmed, machine-learning and knowledge-engineered methods can be used. 2) What information is needed to describe a user for music IR purpose? It may include both the user’s indirect information (e.g. age, sex, citizenship, education, music experience, etc.) and direct information (e.g. user’s interests, definition of qualitative features, appreciation habit, etc.). 3) How to represent, use and share the user model? Similar to MPEG7 concepts, we can use a standard language in text format to represent the user model, so that search engines or information filtering agents can use it to refine the result easily and efficiently, without repeating the long-time observation and learning of the user’s behavior. User modeling can be done on client-side or server-side. Issues including easy/hard to obtain the user information, hard/easy to use collaborative filtering model, far from/close to the music data, more/less privacy or safety, more scalable/higher load on the server, etc., need to be considered when choosing either of the paradigms. We adopted the client-side user modeling paradigm in our MusicCat system. It is an agent that allows the user to define contexts and corresponding features of music that he wants to hear in those contexts correspondingly. Besides, the user can also define qualitative features of music based on quantitative features. For examples, the user just needs to tell the agent what kind of music he prefers to hear at what kind of context, like “I need fast and exciting music when I’m happy”, “I need soft music to wake me up every morning at 8:00”, “I need slow classical music, when I’m thinking”, “I need rhythmic music when I’m walking”, etc. Or, the user can define qualitative features, like “Romantic music for me means slow music with titles or lyric including word love”, “My favorite music includes É” etc. Then, when the moment comes - the user tells the agent or a pre-defined time approaches, the agent can automatically, randomly and repeatedly choose music from the user’s collection according to the pre-defined constraints. So far, MusicCat uses a profile-based user interface. And only midi files are used in the system.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[19.289757, 19.733427]","[38.649094, -1.0950603]","[16.910894, 2.957416, -6.2711873]","[-0.036089603, -9.784541, 29.113409]","[13.369626, 9.089445]","[5.9518094, 2.0363677]","[11.866341, 16.801756, 0.88884974]","[5.5353475, 2.4448113, -0.19108507]"

Schmitz+Institut für Informatik V, Universität Bonn>DEU>education","One major task of a digital music library (DML) is to provide techniques to locate a queried musical pattern in all pieces of music in the database containing that pattern. For a survey of several computational tasks related to this kind of data retrieval we refer to Crawford et al. [3]. Existing DMLs like MELDEX [1], Themefinder [4], and the Sonoda-Muraoka-System [7] work with melody databases relying on score-like information. Retrieval and matching are performed in a fault-tolerant way by string-based methods which mainly take into account pitch information. Generally, rhythm plays only a subordinate role. The music dictionary of Barlow and Morgenstern [2] shows that music retrieval based on pitch information only leads to results with typically too many false matches. (An example of such absurd matches is given in Selfridge-Field [6], p. 27.) We are convinced that both pitch and rhythm are crucial for recognizing melodies. In the more general context of polyphonic music, one is even forced to consider pitch and rhythm information. PROMS, a web-based computer-music service under development at the University of Bonn, Germany, is part of the MiDiLiB project [5]. The aim of PROMS is to design and to implement PROcedures for Music Search. Our discussion will take place in a rather general setting: we assume that our database contains several kinds of music such as polyphonic and homophonic music as well as melodies. We also use score-like information. A query to the database is a fragment of a piece of music. This could be a melody or a certain figure of an accompaniment. The task is now to locate efficiently all occurrences of this fragment in all pieces of music in the database. We have designed and implemented a web-based computer-music service that enables searching in polyphonic music. In contrast to the above mentioned systems, PROMS is not string-based but set-oriented. The basic objects within the PROMS system are single notes, specified by its onset time t, its pitch p, and its duration d. A piece of music is then a finite set M of notes. Our database consists of a sequence of N pieces of music in the MIDI format: D1, . . . , DN. Similarly, a query is itself a finite set Q of notes. Thus there is no principal difference between a piece Di of music in the database and a query Q. However, typically, Di is much larger than Q.

Pinzon+King's College London>GBR>education|Curtin University of Technology>AU>education,"This paper focuses on a set of string pattern-matching problems that arise in musical analysis, and especially in musical information retrieval. A musical score can be viewed as a string: at a very rudimentary level, the alphabet could simply be the set of notes in the chromatic or diatonic notation, or the set of intervals that appear between notes (e.g. pitch may be represented as MIDI numbers and pitch intervals as number of semitones). An important example of flexibility required in score searching arises from the nature of polyphonic music. Within a certain time span each of the simultaneously-performed voices in a musical composition does not, typically, contain the same number of notes. So ‘melodic events’ occurring in one voice may be separated from their neighbours in a score by intervening events in other voices. Since we cannot generally rely on voice information being present in the score we need to allow for temporal ‘gaps’ between events in the matched pattern. Typically, the magnitude of such a gap (which might be expressed as a maximum time value, or, more probably, as a maximum number of skipped event-time-slots) will be a parameter set by the user. In our mathematical treatment the allowance for gaps in the query and the score being searched is represented by the constant α. Fig. 1 shows a short example from a musical score in monophonic format in which we attempt to match a pattern y (also known as the ‘query’) within a music score t (that we will call the ‘text’). This pattern can only be matched by allowing gaps of up to two spaces between pitches in the pattern; Note that the matching of the pattern to the score can be actually ‘approximate’ (see Cambouropolos et al 1999), in that the difference between the pitches and the sequence of musical events could be bounded by a constant δ (for simplicity we set δ to be zero in this example). We can see that there is an occurrence of the pattern in the text, starting at position three because y1, y2, y3, y4 and y5 matches exactly x3, x5, x8, x9 and x11, respectively, with a sequence of gaps G=(g1=1, g2=2, g3=0, g4=1). g1 is the number of spaces between the first two matched pitches in the text (i.e. between (x3=8) and (x5=3)), g2 is the number of spaces between the second and the third matched pitches in the text, and so on. Clearly, this is a valid match because all the gaps are less than or equal to two, which was the given gap restriction. If we want to find matches with a gap of up to one, then this match won’t be a valid one. Fig. 2 shows a similar example but for δ=1 so that the matched pitches don’t need to be exact, an ‘error’ of up to 1 is now allowed. Therefore, the first pitch in the pattern (8) matches the third pitch in the text (7) because |8-7|=1 and that is less or equal to our allowed error of one. The second pitch in the pattern (3) matches the fifth pitch in the text (4) and so on. The sequence of gaps remains exactly the same. The problem of matching with gaps can be formally defined as follows: given a musical sequence x (call the ‘text’) and a motif y (call the ‘pattern’) find all occurrences of y in x such that yi = xji ∀ i ∈ {1..m}, where m is the length of y. Note that y occurs at position j1 of x with a gap sequence G=(g1, g2, …, gm-1), where gi =|ji - ji+1-1| ∀ i ∈ {1..m-1}. We will consider this problem under a variety of conditions: the motif matching can be either exact or approximate. The gaps can be bounded, unbounded or all the same length. We have designed efficient algorithms and implementations of all the above variants.",FRA,education,Developed economies,"[-13.258255, 12.383032]","[21.810581, -15.9851885]","[-3.0721476, 1.2037295, 17.303944]","[11.939037, -11.813936, 1.7598091]","[10.524933, 8.480427]","[8.078302, 1.4862013]","[11.616494, 13.58015, 1.5935905]","[7.525195, 2.1306689, -1.0625281]"
11,Jon W. Dunn,Beyond VARIATIONS: Creating a Digital Music Library.,2000,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415148,Jon W. Dunn+Indiana University>USA>education,"This presentation will focus primarily on work being done at Indiana University in the area of digital music libraries, with some discussion of related efforts.

Indiana University’s VARIATIONS system serves as both an early example of a working digital library supporting music content and an early application of World Wide Web technologies to music. Since April 1996, the system has provided online access within the William and Gayle Cook Music Library to sound recordings from the library’s collections. Unlike many early university-based digital library projects whose primary goals were to provide broader access to unique and/or archival collections, VARIATIONS has built its digital collection from standard musical repertoire identified as central to the teaching mission of the Indiana University School of Music.

At present, the collection available in VARIATIONS encompasses over 6800 sound recording titles, representing a broad range of musical material reflecting the curriculum of the IU School of Music, including operas, songs, instrumental music, jazz, rock, and world music. Recordings are digitized at CD-quality by library staff and stored as both WAV-format “archival” copies and MPEG service copies for delivery to users. Users are able to locate sound recordings either by browsing reserve lists (organized by course number, instructor, composer, and title) or by searching IU’s online library catalog system, IUCAT. Sound files are streamed to users via an IBM VideoCharger server and a customized player application.

VARIATIONS has become an integral part of music library services and the instructional process within the School of Music at IU, but despite its success, VARIATIONS lacks many elements that one might expect to find in a “digital music library.” One such element is access to formats other than audio. In fact, the very name VARIATIONS was intended in part to convey the idea that musical information by its nature comes in many different formats (including sound, notation, time-based information, text, video) and that access to all of these formats in an integrated fashion is a desirable goal for a digital music library system.

Indiana University has recently embarked on a four-year project to dramatically expand upon the current VARIATIONS system to create a Digital Music Library with funding from the National Science Foundation and National Endowment for the Humanities as part of the federal Digital Library Initiatives – Phase 2 (DLI2) program. Lead Principal Investigator for the project is Dr. Michael A. McRobbie, Vice President for Information Technology and Professor of Philosophy and Computer Science at IU. This project, involving faculty from music, law, and library and information science, and librarians and staff from both the library system and information technology services department, centers around three main tasks: First, the project will create a Digital Music Library (DML) testbed system. Secondly, applications will be developed for music education and research based upon the collections and functionality provided by the DML testbed. Finally, the DML will be used as a foundation for research in the areas of instruction, usability, and intellectual property rights.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[21.432428, 28.411219]","[37.868484, 4.8705254]","[25.98783, 1.1172848, -9.142702]","[-1.0625913, -0.6752529, 19.014656]","[13.210339, 8.158529]","[5.5743337, 1.5112052]","[12.542755, 16.33803, 0.46593618]","[5.529256, 1.8427349, -0.02872784]"

14,Michael Good,Representing Music Using XML.,2000,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1415032,Michael Good+Recordare>USA>company,"Why does the world need another music representation language? Beyond MIDI describes over 20 different languages or musical codes (Selfridge-Field, 1997). Most commercial music programs have their own internal, proprietary music representation and file format. Music's complexity has led to this proliferation of languages and formats. Sequencers, notation programs, analysis tools, and retrieval tools all need musical information optimized in different ways.

Yet no music interchange language has been widely adopted since MIDI. MIDI has contributed to enormous growth in the electronic music industry, but has many well-known limitations for notation, analysis, and retrieval. These include its lack of representation of musical concepts such as rests and enharmonic pitches (distinguishing Db from C#), as well as notation concepts such as stem direction and beaming. Other interchange formats such as NIFF and SMDL overcome these restrictions, but have not been widely adopted.

Successful interchange formats such as MIDI and HTML share a common trait that NIFF and SMDL lack. MIDI and HTML skillfully balance simplicity and power. They are simple enough for many people to learn, and powerful enough for many real-world applications. The simplicity makes it easy for software developers to implement the standards and to develop encoding tools for musicians. This helps circumvent the “chicken-and-egg” problem with new formats.

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation for representing structured data in text, designed for ease of usage over the Internet by a wide variety of applications. XML is a meta-markup language that lets designers and communities develop their own representation languages for different applications. Like HTML and MIDI, it balances simplicity and power in a way that has made it very attractive to software developers.

The common base of XML technology lets developers of new languages focus on representation issues instead of low-level software development. All XML-based languages can be processed by a variety of XML tools available from multiple vendors. Since XML files are text files, users of XML files always have generic text-based tools available as a lowest common denominator. XML documents are represented in Unicode, providing support for international score exchange.

MusicXML is an XML-based music interchange language. It represents common western musical notation from the 17th century onwards, including both classical and popular music. The language is designed to be extensible to future coverage of early music and less standard 20th and 21st century scores. Non-western musical notations would use a separate XML language. As an interchange language, it is designed to be sufficient, not optimal, for diverse musical applications. MusicXML is not intended to supersede other languages that are optimized for specific musical applications, but to support sharing of musical data between applications.

The current MusicXML software runs on Windows. As of September 2000, it reads 100% of the MuseData format plus portions of NIFF and Finale’s Enigma Transportable Files (ETF). It writes to Standard MIDI Files in Format 1, MuseData files, and Sibelius. The NIFF, ETF, and MIDI converters use XML versions of these languages as intermediate structures. MusicXML is defined using an XML Document Type Definition (DTD) at www.musicxml.com/xml.html.

16,David Huron,Perceptual and Cognitive Applications in Music Information Retrieval.,2000,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1414794,David Huron+Ohio State University>USA>education,"Music librarians and cataloguers have traditionally created indexes that allow users to access musical works using standard reference information, such as the name of the composer or the title of the work. While this basic information remains important, these standard reference tags have surprisingly limited applicability in most music-related queries. Music is used for an extraordinary variety of purposes: the restaurateur seeks music that targets a certain clientele; the aerobics instructor seeks a certain tempo; the film director seeks music conveying a certain mood; an advertiser seeks a tune that is highly memorable; the physiotherapist seeks music that will motivate a patient; the truck driver seeks music that will keep him/her alert. Although there are many other uses for music, music’s preeminent functions are social and psychological. The most useful retrieval indexes are those that facilitate searching according to such social and psychological functions. Typically, such indexes will focus on stylistic, mood, and similarity information. In attempting to build such musical indexes, two general questions arise: (1) What is the best taxonomic system by which to classify moods, styles, and other musical characteristics? (2) How can we create automated systems that will reliably characterize recordings or scores? Internet-based music distribution has brought these two questions to the fore. In the case of proprietary musical databases, the second problem can be centrally managed, and perhaps addressed using manual methods. However, past experience with Internet access to text documents implies that non-proprietary decentralized indexing is likely to prove more popular and successful. That is, future music indexes will likely resemble web-wide search engines (like Infoseek or Google) rather than closed proprietary systems (like Beatscape or Encyclopedia Britannica). The problem of building musical web crawlers that traverse the web and index music-related files (such as MP3) should prove challenging. The enabling technology for such musical web crawlers will need to draw extensively on research in music perception and cognition. Consider two sample problems: music summarization and mood characterization.

18,Özgür Izmirli,Using a Spectral Flatness Based Feature for Audio Segmentation and Retrieval.,2000,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1416438,Ozgur Izmirli+Connecticut College>USA>education,"A method that utilizes a spectral flatness based tonality feature for segmentation and content-based retrieval of audio is outlined. The method uses the tonality measure which is derived from the discrete bark spectrum as a means of detecting transitions between tonal and noise-like parts of the audio input. The meaning of ‘tonal’ in this context is different from the music-theoretical meaning and implies that there are dominant sinusoidal components in the spectrum, but, does not indicate that they are consonant or harmonic in any sense. Segmentation is performed by determining the times of these transitions, hence providing reference points for search purposes. Search is carried out by pivoting the query information on these reference points. The cumulative distance between the tonality pattern in successive frames of the query and the candidate sound fragments is used as a measure of similarity. In order to quantify the tonality, the input is processed as follows: the signal is sampled at 22050 Hz and a 2048-point FFT is performed on each frame using a Hanning analysis window. The window is hopped every 71 msecs. which corresponds to approximately 30 % overlap with the previous window. A pre-emphasis filter is applied to compensate for the reduced sensitivity of the human ear at low frequencies. The bark-band filter outputs are calculated from the FFT output by integration of the power spectral density within the critical bands. This is followed by a stage in which tonality determination is carried out for each critical band. The Spectral Flatness Measure (SFM) and the corresponding tonality coefficient (Johnston 1988) are used to quantify the tonal quality, i.e. how much tone-like the sound is as opposed to being noise-like. SFM is defined by the ratio of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean of the power spectral density components in each critical band. A tonality vector is defined to be the collection of tonality coefficients for a single frame. More specifically, the tonality vector contains a tonality coefficient for each critical band. In order to perform segmentation, the tonal-to-noise and the noise-to-tonal transitions are obtained. These transitions are calculated, as a sequence bj (j is the time index), from the rate of change of the smoothed tonality vector with respect to time. The smoothing occurs due to averaging of the tonality vectors across several frames. By detecting rapid changes in the summary tonality in either direction, segmentation decisions are made. The sequence bj is an indicator for the overall tonal quality change of the input signal. Whenever tonal inputs become dominant in the input signal, for example, with the start of a vocal or solo instrument, the value of the indicator increases during the transition. That is to say, an increase in the value of b (over time) is interpreted as a transition from a noisy part to a more tonal part. Conversely, the decrease in the value of b, possibly extending to the negative extreme, indicates a transition from tonal to noisy spectra. The search for an audio fragment is done by comparing a short sequence of tonality vectors in the database with the same number of tonality vectors in the search sequence. As an exhaustive search is very costly for this purpose, a selective search that uses segments corresponding to relatively high perceptual entropy is performed. The determination of these segments is performed by the use of the b sequence. The starting times of these segments are called anchor times and are classified as either ‘tonal-to-noise’, or, ‘noise-to-tonal’. The noise-to-tonal anchor",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-14.297829, 26.498829]","[2.1137116, -28.219896]","[10.893157, -12.225664, 7.0924983]","[7.0893636, -4.2509947, -7.054572]","[11.483854, 9.031994]","[10.609424, 3.2262743]","[10.903579, 15.3193, 0.16599207]","[8.426947, 3.7590845, -0.97211236]"

Kim+MIT Media Lab>USA>education;Wei Chai+MIT Media Lab>USA>education;Ricardo Garcia+MIT Media Lab>USA>education;Barry Vercoe+MIT Media Lab>USA>education,"Identifying a musical work from a melodic fragment is a task that most people are able to accomplish with relative ease. For some time now researchers have worked to give computers this ability as well, as it would be the cornerstone of any query-by-humming system. To accomplish this, it is reasonable to study how humans are able to perform this task, and to assess what features we use to determine melodic similarity. Research has shown that melodic contour is an important feature in determining melodic similarity, but it is also clear that rhythmic information is important as well. The goal of this research is to explore what variation of contour and rhythmic information can result in the most efficient, robust, and scalable representation for melody. We intend for this to be the basis of a query-by-humming system that will be used to test the validity of our proposed representation. The importance of melodic contour The literature suggests that a coarse melodic contour description is more important to listeners than strict intervals in determining melodic similarity. Experiments have shown that interval direction alone (i.e. the 3-level +/-/0 contour representation) is an important element of melody recognition. There is, of course, anecdotal and experimental evidence that humans use more than just interval direction (a 3-level contour) in assessing melodic similarity. In an experiment by Lindsay (1996), subjects were asked to repeat (sing) a melody that was played for them. He found that while there was some correlation between sung interval accuracy and musical experience, even musically inexperienced subjects were able to negotiate different interval sizes fairly successfully. From a practical standpoint, a 3-level representation will generally require longer queries to arrive at a unique match. Given the perceptual and practical considerations, we chose to explore finer (5- and 7-level) contour divisions for our representation. Proposed melody representation We used a triple <T P B> to represent each melody, where T is the time signature of the song, P is the pitch contour vector, and B is the beat number vector. The range of values of P vary depending on the number of levels of contour used, but follow the pattern of 0, +, -, ++, --, +++, etc. The first value of B is the location of the first note within its measure in beats (according to the time signature). Successive values of B are incremented according to the number of beats between successive notes. Values of B are quantized to the nearest whole beat. Additionally, we used a vector Q to represent different contour resolutions and quantization boundaries. The length of Q indirectly reveals the number of levels of contour being used, and the individual values of Q indicate the absolute value of the quantization boundaries (in number of half-steps). For example, Q = [0 1] represents that we quantize interval changes into three levels, 0 for no change, + for an ascending interval (a boundary at one half-step or more), and - for a descending interval. This representation is equivalent to the popular +/-/0 or U/D/R (up/down/repeat) representation. Q = [0 1 3] represents a quantization of intervals into five levels, 0 for no change, + for an ascending half-step or whole-step (1 or 2 half-steps), ++ for ascending at least a minor third (3 or more half-steps), - for a descending half-step or whole-step, and -- for a descent of at least a minor third. Thus far, we have assembled a data set of 50 multi-track MIDI files, containing a mixture of popular and classical music. The popular music selections span a variety of different countries.

I describe a theory of musical meaning that argues that experienced listeners of tonal music hear musical motion metaphorically, as purposeful action within a dynamic field of musical forces (musical gravity, magnetism, and inertia). That theory has been used to clarify issues in Schenkerian theory, to analyze music in many styles, to improve the training of musicians, to account for experimental results in melodic expectation, to explain striking regularities in published analyses of tonal music, and even to illuminate the phenomenon of ""swing"" in jazz.   

The assumptions of that theory generate a small set of patterns and pattern combinations. This small set of patterns crops up over and over again in tonal music. Recognizing these patterns and their significance requires seeing how they are embellished in particular pieces. I illustrate these patterns, their combinations and embellishments, and something about their meaning by analyzing several folk songs, including ""Ah, vous dirai-je, Maman"" and Mozart's variations on it.   

The ubiquity of this small set of patterns raises interesting questions about searching for musical patterns, about the role of computers in information retrieval vs their role in musical artificial intelligence, and about musical meaning.

Uitdenbogerd+RMIT University>AUS>education;Abhijit Chattaraj+RMIT University>AUS>education;Justin Zobel+RMIT University>AUS>education,"Music Information Retrieval has a longer history than most people realise, with systems developed in the 1960's. The field has its roots in information retrieval, musicology and music psychology. Information retrieval has provided us with a framework for evaluating retrieval systems. Musicologists have applied various techniques to measure stylistic parameters of composers and general similarity of musical works. Music perception research has taught us that contour is the most important feature of melody for listeners (Dowling 1978). Precursors to computerised music IR are the incipit and theme indexes such as Barlow and Morganstern's dictionary of musical themes (Barlow and Morganstern 1948), however, on-line collections with incipit indexes were soon to follow (for example Hudson 1970). The current trend in music IR research has been to develop systems that allow the location of answers to queries presented as hummed melodies, or entered in some other way. The earliest system we have found was that developed by Yamamoto in 1988, which only allowed exact matches (Kageyama et al 1993). The nineties have shown a rapid increase in music IR research, with systems papers being published every year since 1993 and more than a dozen published in 1998 (eg. Uitdenbogerd and Zobel 1998, Blackburn and de Roure1998, Hewlett and Selfridge-Field 1998). In addition, interesting developments have occurred in the field of audio retrieval. Despite this growth of interest in the field, the comparison of systems is difficult because of the lack of a common data set, queries, or relevance judgements. MIR systems can be evaluated in a similar manner to other systems. As with traditional IR, we need to decide what is a query, what is an answer, and what is meant by relevance, that is, what constitutes similarity. The usual definition of an ad hoc music query is a melody fragment consisting of a sequence of notes. The relevance of answers produced by a system will depend on the user's need. For example, relevant answers for a search for copyright similarity may be different to those for a user who half remembers a song. In earlier work, we collected queries and relevance judgements from a collection of 10,466 MIDI files by assuming that alternative arrangements or performances of a piece chosen as a query were relevant, and used these to measure effectiveness with the standard techniques of eleven-point precision averages and precision at k pieces retrieved. These were used to determine which matching techniques were most successful. Whether these relevance judgements correspond to - or yield the same ranking of techniques as - human relevance judgements was an open question. In recent work, we collected manual queries by having an expert musician listen to MIDI files and create a melodic query for each file. The files were selected so as to allow comparison with our earlier work with automatic queries and relevance assessments. We also developed a system for collecting music relevance judgements from listeners to permit a more established approach to system evaluation. Users were presented with a MIDI file melody and were required to determine whether each answer was highly similar or not.",AUS,education,Developed economies,"[23.491798, 32.56728]","[24.507856, -6.537019]","[28.107895, 6.9945188, -4.8058534]","[6.4099116, -4.567081, 11.122615]","[13.441931, 8.535872]","[6.9984746, 1.8083968]","[12.344155, 16.436281, 1.0103915]","[6.5897355, 2.2665503, -0.7555643]"

Uitdenbogerd+RMIT University>AUS>education;Justin Zobel+RMIT University>AUS>education,"Several techniques have been proposed for matching melody queries to stored music. In previous work [2], we found that local alignment, a technique derived from bioinformatics, was more effective than the n-gram methods derived from information retrieval that are used in other work. In this paper we explore a broader range of n-gram techniques, and test them with both manual queries and queries automatically extracted from MIDI files. Our experiments show that alternative - indeed, simpler - n-gram matching techniques than those tested in earlier work can be as effective as local alignment; one highly effective technique is to simply count the number of 5-grams in common between query and stored piece of music. N-grams are particularly effective for short queries and manual queries, while local alignment is superior for the automatic queries. In our experiments we have used a database of 10 466 standard MIDI files down loaded from the internet. These were processed to extract their melodies as described in [1]. In that earlier paper, we used volunteer listeners to judge a small set of extracted melodies. We discovered that our simple algorithm that chooses notes starting at each instance to be melody notes and that we have named all mono, was the most successful in extracting melodies. However, we continued to test all of our melody extraction algorithms in our second paper [2] in the context of melodic similarity measurement. In this experiment we used three methods of melodic standardisation to produce the representations that would be used for matching. They were: contour, which uses a three-symbol alphabet to represent where a melody goes up, down or stays the same; modulo-12 interval (pitch distance between notes), which keeps the size of intervals and their direction but reduced to one octave; and exact interval, which keeps the exact interval size and direction. All these represented pitch information only. A set of 28 automatically extracted melody queries were used to locate other versions of the same piece of music. The results were evaluated by computing the eleven-point precision average and the precision at a recall level of 20. Again the all mono method was successful, as were the entropy channel and all channels methods. The entropy channel method applies the all mono technique to each channel and then selects the melody channel based on its first order predictive entropy. The all channels technique also applies the all mono algorithm to each channel and then retains them all for the matching process. In addition, we confirmed that contour was insufficient for good matching, but that the use of interval sequences worked well. Queries of 30 intervals produced good answers. The similarity measurement techniques tested were local alignment, longest common subsequence, an n-gram counting technique that included the frequency of occurrence of each n-gram, and the Ukkonen n-gram measure. Local alignment was a clear winner. However, local alignment is a slow technique. It would be useful to have a good n-gram-based technique as indexes can be built to speed up matches. This led to our current exploration of n-grams. In this current set of experiments we used the same experimental framework as that used in [2], but also tested a set of manually produced queries. These manual queries were created by a classically trained pianist with perfect pitch, who listened to the source MI DI files and played a melodic fragment to represent each piece. We explored the variables of n-gram length, n-gram counting method, song-length normalisation, melody extraction and query length. The results clearly showed that n-grams of length five work best using the count distinct method, where term",AUS,education,Developed economies,"[24.312635, 14.461618]","[26.819763, -13.623586]","[19.845736, 13.172386, -1.7199333]","[13.438788, -9.73011, 8.354745]","[12.946519, 9.609232]","[7.518619, 1.3006247]","[11.559912, 16.462008, 1.5133232]","[7.0128784, 1.8082291, -0.87020797]"

This paper focuses on the pitch aspect of melodic similarity, scrutinising the term pitch replacing it by a less ambivalent and overused term, which we will call meloton. Based on the term meloton the paper suggests to approach the issue of ‘melotonic’ similarity from a transformational angle, where transformations are executed as reflections and translations. ‘Melotonic’ similarity then is seen as related to the transformation process in form of a transpositional and interval vector.

A central hypothesis is the local syntactic consistency, which claims that file name syntaxes, whatever they are, are locally consistent within clusters of related music files. These heuristics allow to parse successfully file names without knowing their syntax a priori, using statistical measures on clusters of files, rather than on parsing files on a strict individual basis.

In order to identify and segment a tune, well-known signal processing techniques are applied to the singing voice. After detecting pitch, a novel post-processing stage is proposed to adjust the intonation of the user. A global refinement is based on a relative scale estimated out of the most frequent errors made by singers. Four rules are then employed to eliminate local errors. This front end has been tested with five subjects and four short tunes, detecting some 90% of right notes. Results have been compared to other approximation methods like rounding to the nearest absolute tone/interval and an example of adaptive moving tuning, achieving respectively 74%, 80% and 44% of right estimations.

Smiraglia+Long Island University>USA>education,"Musical works form a key entity for music information retrieval. Explicit linkage of relationships among entities is critical for document-based information retrieval. Works contain representations of recorded knowledge. Core bodies of work—canons—function to preserve and disseminate the parameters of a culture. A musical work is an intellectual sonic conception. Musical works take documentary form in a variety of instantiations. Epistemology for documentary analysis provides key perceptual information about the objects of knowledge organization. Works are carriers of knowledge, representing deliberately-constructed packages of both rational and empirical evidence of human knowledge. Smiraglia (2001) suggests the parameters of a theory of the work, incorporating the tools of epistemology to comprehend works by expressing theoretical parameters in the context of a taxonomic definition. A work is a signifying, concrete set of ideational conceptions that finds realization through semantic or symbolic expression.

The main problem of LPC is that although only the amplitudes of harmonic partials are reliable samples drawn from the spectral envelope, the whole spectrum is used for filter estimation.

Song2Quartet allows users to add novelty to listening experience of their favorite songs and gain familiarity with string quartets. Previous work in automatic arrangement of music only used symbolic scores to achieve a particular musical style; our challenge is to also consider audio features of the target popular song. In addition to typical audio music content analysis such as beat and chord estimation, we also use time-frequency spectral analysis in order to better reflect partial phrases of the song in its cover version. Song2Quartet produces a probabilistic network of possible musical notes at every sixteenth note for each accompanying instrument of the quartet by combining beats, chords, and spectrogram from the target song with Markov chains estimated from our corpora of quartet music. As a result, the musical score of the cover version can be generated by finding the optimal paths through these networks.

More specifically, it investigates the ability of the system to produce meaningful blends between harmonic cadences, which arguably constitute the most fundamental harmonic concept. The system creates a variety of blends combining elements of the penultimate chords of two input cadences and it further estimates the expected relationships between the produced blends. Then, a preliminary subjective evaluation of the proposed blending system is presented. A pairwise dissimilarity listening test was conducted using original and blended cadences as stimuli. Subsequent multidimensional scaling analysis produced spatial configurations for both behavioural data and dissimilarity estimations by the algorithm. Comparison of the two configurations showed that the system is capable of making fair predictions of the perceived dissimilarities between the blended cadences.

However, it may not be appropriate to use them to separate time-varying harmonic signals such as vocals, vibratos, and glissandos, as they lack in temporal continuity. Based on the observation that the spectral distributions of harmonic and percussive signals differ – i.e., harmonic components have harmonic and sparse structure while percussive components are broadband – we propose an algorithm that successfully separates the rapidly time-varying harmonic signals from the percussive ones by imposing different constraints on the two groups of spectral bases.

The Piano Model, on the other hand, is an instrument-specific model tailored for piano. Its modeling quality is lower but it can learn from training data (consisting entirely of isolated tones), resolve the overlapping partials and thus separate the mixtures. We formulate a new hierarchical Bayesian framework to run both Models in the source separation process so that the mixtures with overlapping partials can be separated with high quality.

Here we propose an automated method to identify tune families by adapting genetic sequence alignment algorithms designed for automatic identification and alignment of protein families. We tested the effectiveness of our method against a high-quality ground-truth dataset of 26 folk tunes from four diverse tune families (two English, two Japanese) that had previously been identified and aligned manually by expert musicologists. We tested different combinations of parameters related to sequence alignment and to modeling of pitch, rhythm, and text to find the combination that best matched the ground-truth classifications. The best-performing automated model correctly grouped 100% (26/26) of the tunes in terms of overall similarity to other tunes, identifying 85% (22/26) of these tunes as forming distinct tune families.

In this paper, we extend our previous work on feature selection for music genre recognition and focus on so-called “album effect” meaning that optimised classification models may overemphasize relevant characteristics of particular artists and albums rather than learning relevant properties of genres. For that case we examine the performance of classification models on two validation sets after the optimisation with feature selection: the first set with tracks not used for training and feature selection but randomly selected from the same albums, and the second set with tracks selected from other albums. As it can be expected, the classification performance on the second set decreases.

This is particularly true of music theatre, where a traditional recording cannot sufficiently capture the ephemeral phenomena unique to each staging. In this paper we introduce a toolkit developed with, and used by, a musicologist throughout a complete multi-day production of Richard Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen. The toolkit is centred on a tablet-based score interface through which the scholar makes notes on the scenic setting of the performance as it unfolds, supplemented by a variety of digital data gathered to structure and index the annotations. We report on our experience developing a system suitable for real-time use by the musicologist, structuring the data for reuse and further investigation using semantic web technologies, and of the practical challenges and compromises of fieldwork within a working theatre. Finally we consider the utility of our tooling from both a user perspective and through an initial quantitative investigation of the data gathered.""",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[-0.91468334, 15.458482]","[28.38782, 6.3770313]","[5.2455215, -11.661771, -15.970166]","[-0.7458177, -2.4557405, 26.138409]","[11.451216, 7.860973]","[5.735458, 1.4008023]","[11.719746, 14.847449, 0.7408502]","[5.593429, 2.507511, 0.42760894]"

The harmonic dictionary is adapted to the non-percussive music content in a standard NMF procedure. The percussive dictionary is adapted to each individual signal in an iterative scheme: it is fixed during the decomposition process, and is updated based on the result of the previous convergence.

A first approach is based on automatic detection of ride cymbal (RC) onsets and evaluation of relative time intervals between them. However, small errors in the onset detection propagate considerably into the swing ratio estimates. As our main technical contribution, we propose to use the log-lag autocorrelation function (LLACF) as a mid-level representation for estimating swing ratios, circumventing the error-prone detection of RC onsets. In our experiments, the LLACF-based swing ratio estimates prove to be more reliable than the ones based on RC onset detection.

This paper presents a preliminary study aiming at discussing ways to annotate and to evaluate offset times for pitched non-percussive instruments. Moreover, we conduct a case study of offset detection in violin recordings by evaluating a number of energy, spectral flux, and pitch based methods using a new dataset covering 6 different violin playing techniques. The new dataset, which is going to be shared with the research community, consists of 63 violin recordings that are thoroughly annotated based on perceptual loudness and note transition. The offset detection methods, which are adapted from well-known methods for onset detection, are evaluated using an onset-aware method we propose for this task.

In this paper, we consider the problem of analyzing multiple performances of the same symphonic piece, performed by different orchestras and different conductors. While differences between interpretations in this genre may include commonly studied features on timing, dynamics and articulation, the timbre of the orchestra and choices of balance within the ensemble are other important aspects distinguishing different orchestral interpretations from one another. While it is hard to model these higher-level aspects as explicit audio features, they can usually be noted visually in spectrogram plots. We therefore propose a method to compare orchestra performances by examining visual spectrogram characteristics. Inspired by eigenfaces in human face recognition, we apply Principal Components Analysis on synchronized performance fragments to localize areas of cross-performance variation in time and frequency.

Proposed methodologies focus either on specific aspects of harmony (e.g., generating abstract chord symbols) or incorporate the determination of many harmonic characteristics in a single probabilistic generative scheme. This paper addresses the problem of assigning voice leading focussing on the bass voice, i.e., the realisation of the actual bass pitches of an abstract chord sequence, under the scope of a modular melodic harmonisation system where different aspects of the generative process are arranged by different modules. The proposed technique defines the motion of the bass voice according to several statistical aspects: melody voice contour, previous bass line motion, bass-to-melody distances and statistics regarding inversions and note doublings in chords. The aforementioned aspects of voicing are modular, i.e., each criterion is defined by independent statistical learning tools. Experimental results on diverse music idioms indicate that the proposed methodology captures efficiently the voice layout characteristics of each idiom, whilst additional analyses on separate statistically trained modules reveal distinctive aspects of each idiom. The proposed system is designed to be flexible and adaptable (for instance, for the generation of novel blended melodic harmonisations).",GRC,education,Developed economies,"[6.5842676, -24.458145]","[-11.743864, -6.065606]","[-19.08468, 10.291426, -8.89281]","[-14.007879, 13.9216385, -5.524654]","[9.180998, 10.079522]","[11.274428, 3.8970766]","[9.343791, 14.497727, 2.189592]","[8.844818, 3.4156234, -1.3397728]"

However, such data does exist for speech. We therefore propose to make phoneme recognition models more robust for singing by training them on speech data that has artificially been made more “song-like”.

So, besides the suitability between the vertically overlaid tracks (i.e. vertical mashability) used in previous studies, we proposed to further consider the suitability between the horizontally connected consecutive music segments (i.e. horizontal mashability) when searching for proper music segments to be combined. On the vertical side, two new factors: “harmonic change balance” and “volume weight” have been considered. On the horizontal side, the methods used in the studies of medley creation are incorporated. Combining vertical and horizontal mashabilities together, we defined four levels of mashability that may be encountered and found the proper solution to each of them.

First, we investigate an NMF-based algorithm for transcribing guitar performances.

Shortened versions of three pieces from The Sound of Music were selected: “Edelweiss”, “Do-Re-Mi” and “My Favourite Things”. 39 participants sang three repetitions of each excerpt without accompaniment, resulting in a dataset of 21762 notes in 117 recordings. To obtain pitch estimates we used the Tony software’s automatic transcription and manual correction tools. Pitch accuracy was measured in terms of pitch error and interval error. We show that singers’ pitch accuracy correlates significantly with self-reported singing skill and musical training. Larger intervals led to larger errors, and the tritone interval in particular led to average errors of one third of a semitone. Note duration (or inter-onset interval) had a significant effect on pitch accuracy, with greater accuracy on longer notes. To model drift in the tonal centre over time, we present a sliding window model which reveals patterns in the pitch errors of some singers.

The GCT allows the re-arrangement of the notes of a harmonic sonority such that abstract idiom-specific types of chords may be derived. This encoding is inspired by the standard roman numeral chord type labelling and is, therefore, ideal for hierarchic harmonic systems such as the tonal system and its many variations; at the same time, it adjusts to any other harmonic system such as post-tonal, atonal music, or traditional polyphonic systems. In this paper the descriptive potential of the GCT is assessed in the tonal idiom by comparing GCT harmonic labels with human expert annotations (Kostka & Payne harmonic dataset). Additionally, novel methods for grouping and clustering chords, according to their GCT encoding and their functional role in chord sequences, are introduced.

Nevertheless, one of the main problems of using score information is the misalignment between the score and the actual performance. A potential solution to this problem is the use of audio to score alignment systems. However, most of them rely on a tolerance window that clearly affects the separation results. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method to refine the aligned score at note level by detecting both, onset and offset for each note present in the score. Note refinement is achieved by detecting shapes and contours in the estimated instrument-wise time activation (gains) matrix. Decomposition is performed in a supervised way, using training instrument models and coarsely-aligned score information. The detected contours define time-frequency note boundaries, and they increase the sparsity.

When the pedal is pressed, notes played will continue to sound until the string vibration naturally ceases. This makes the notes longer than their notated lengths and overlap with later notes. In this paper, we propose an approach to address this problem. Given that the most competitive wrong score positions for each audio frame are the ones before the correct position due to the sustained sounds, we remove partials of sustained notes and only retain partials of “new notes” in the audio representation. This operation reduces sustain-pedal effects by weakening the match between the audio frame and previous wrong score positions, hence encourages the system to align to the correct score position.

Therefore, we investigate the use of syncopation patterns in the RAG-collection from its beginnings until the present time in this paper. Using computational methods, this paper provides an overview on the use of rhythmical patterns of the ragtime genre, thereby offering valuable new insights that complement musicological hypotheses about this genre. Specifically, we measure the amount of syncopation for each bar using Longuet-Higgins and Lee’s model of syncopation, determine the most frequent rhythmic patterns, and discuss the role of a specific short-long-short syncopation pattern that musicologists argue is characteristic for ragtime. A comparison between the ragtime (pre-1920) and modern (post-1920) era shows that the two eras differ in syncopation pattern use. Onset density and amount of syncopation increase after 1920. Moreover, our study confirms the musicological hypothesis on the important role of the short-long-short syncopation pattern in ragtime.

Recently, kernel additive modeling with generalized spatial Wiener filtering (GW) was presented for music/voice separation. In this paper, an adaptive auditory filtering based on β-order minimum mean-square error spectral amplitude estimation (bSA) is applied to the kernel additive modeling for improving the singing voice separation performance from monaural music signal. The proposed algorithm is composed of five modules: short time Fourier transform, music/voice separation based on bSA, determination of back-fitting, back-fitting, and inverse short time Fourier transform. In the proposed method, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based factorized spectral amplitude exponent β for each kernel component is adaptively calculated for effective bSA-based auditory filtering performance during kernel back-fitting. Using a back-fitting threshold, the kernel back-fitting process can automatically be iteratively performed until convergence.

Therefore, this work explores the behavior of these two high performing systems as a means of understanding obstacles and limitations in chord estimation, arriving at four critical observations: one, music recordings that invalidate tacit assumptions about harmony and tonality result in erroneous and even misleading performance; two, standard lexicons and comparison methods struggle to reflect the natural relationships between chords; three, conventional approaches conflate the competing goals of recognition and transcription to some undefined degree; and four, the perception of chords in real music can be highly subjective, making the very notion of “ground truth” annotations tenuous.

This facilitates an evaluation of the effectiveness of automatic analysis algorithms in generalizing across different musical textures. The pieces are encoded in standard **kern format, with analyses jointly encoded using an extension to **kern. The harmonic content of the music was analyzed with both Roman numerals and function labels in duplicate by two different expert analyzers. The pieces are divided into musical phrases, allowing for multiple-levels of automatic analysis, including chord labeling and phrase parsing. This paper describes the content of the dataset in detail, including the types of chords represented, and discusses the ways in which the analyzers sometimes disagreed on the lower-level harmonic content (the Roman numerals) while converging at similar high-level structures (the function of the chords within the phrase).",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-8.716606, 17.363878]","[-4.7820797, -8.371413]","[6.240027, 6.4582133, 18.416864]","[-12.070575, 8.746296, 3.303349]","[10.914503, 7.851694]","[10.997234, 3.2881858]","[12.19329, 14.037008, 1.2821912]","[8.358789, 3.07808, -1.3372047]"

We argue that it is more natural from the listener’s point of view to regard emotional variation in music as a progression of emotionally stable segments. In order to enable such tracking of emotion over time it is necessary to segment music at the emotional boundaries. To address this problem we conduct a formal evaluation of different segmentation methods as applied to a task of emotional boundary detection. We collect emotional boundary annotations from three annotators for 52 musical pieces from the RWC music collection that already have structural annotations from the SALAMI dataset. We investigate how well structural segmentation explains emotional segmentation and find that there is a large overlap, though about a quarter of emotional boundaries do not coincide with structural ones. We also study inter-annotator agreement on emotional segmentation.

In our experiment, participants decided whether words were emotionally positive or negative while listening to music that was chosen to induce positive or negative mood. The behavioral results show that the music manipulation was effective, as participants were biased to label words positive in the positive music condition. The DDM shows that this bias was driven by a change in the starting point of evidence accumulation, which indicates an a priori response bias. In contrast, there was no evidence that music affected how participants evaluated the emotional content of the stimuli.

In this paper, we examine both acoustic and subjective approaches for calculating similarity between artists, comparing their performance on a common database of 400 popular artists. Specifically, we evaluate acoustic techniques based on Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and an intermediate ‘anchor space’ of genre classification, and subjective techniques which use data from The All Music Guide, from a survey, from playlists and personal collections, and from web-text mining. We find the following: (1) Acoustic-based measures can achieve agreement with ground truth data that is at least comparable to the internal agreement between different subjective sources. However, we observe significant differences between superficially similar distribution modeling and comparison techniques. (2) Subjective measures from diverse sources show reasonable agreement, with the measure derived from co-occurrence in personal music collections being the most reliable overall. (3) Our methodology for large-scale cross-site music similarity evaluations is practical and convenient, yielding directly comparable numbers for different approaches.

The project aims to test the viability of the OAI standard for providing access to sheet music collections on the web, and to build a permanent and increasingly participatory service for the discovery of digital sheet music. The service provider design has been informed by detailed usability testing, and by limitations imposed by the variations in metadata harvested from the different participating collections. Advanced services in addition to basic searching and browsing have been developed, including the ability to save and share subsets across participating collections. Harvesting and searching strategies for overcoming metadata limitations are being developed. The consortium is seeking additional participants with digital sheet music collections, and is exploring the possibility of incorporating scores and audio into the project. Digital sheet music collections were among the earliest substantial music collections to appear on the web. Most significantly, digital sheet music collections have been mounted by the Library of Congress, Johns Hopkins University, and Duke University. There are many other important collections, resulting in a rich distributed research resource for music. Sheet music collections have become the focus of digitization projects for a number of reasons relating to the publication format, its component parts, and the resulting problems in providing access, either through traditional cataloging systems, or by other means. A piece of sheet music generally consists of a number of different components, brought together for a specific publication. These include the music itself, usually consisting of between two and eight pages; a cover page, that often includes graphic artwork and/or a photographic reproduction; and advertisements, either for additional sheet music from the same publisher, or from other vendors. The most common sheet music genre is popular song, and the text of these songs comprises another important element of the publication. It seems likely that providing access to the cover art of sheet music has been the prime motivation for many sheet music projects. The graphic artwork found on published sheet music is often very decorative, and provides information of interest to a wide variety of scholars, including historians of art, cultural historians, sociologists, and so on. Much as sound recordings are today, sheet music of the C19th and early C20th documents taste, attitudes, and societal concerns, across time, and in different geographical locations. Sheet music may also reflect the concerns of specific groups of people (e.g. political publications), or entire nations (e.g. nationalistic publications). Songs that become perennial favorites were often republished with changes in text (e.g. taking out insulting epithets; or perhaps writing completely new words for a favorite tune), new cover graphic arts; or simply changes in the advertising. All of these changes document changing attitudes both musical and non-musical. Traditional cataloging schemes have had a difficult time capturing the disparate elements that make up a single piece of sheet music, let alone the relationships between repeated publications of a single work. In addition sheet music has usually been published as simply music, with little recorded about the cover art or the text. For example, an AACR2 catalog record for a piece of sheet music would typically record the genre (e.g. “Piano music” or “Songs with piano”); include transcriptions of title, attribution, and publication information; and provide access points to composer and lyricist. Information about the cover art and subject of the song—other than that obvious from the title —typically would be absent. These difficulties, both the physical structure and the cataloging problem, along with the recognition that sheet music has unique research potential, have meant that sheet music collections have often found a home among institutional “Special Collections,” rather than in the music library. These problems, along with interest from a wide variety of users, have encouraged the creation of digital sheet.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[6.622174, 20.987467]","[36.539883, 8.565179]","[11.975741, -8.072119, -13.830307]","[-3.0466707, -0.4794046, 24.412838]","[10.205848, 7.4432592]","[5.1047215, 1.4524305]","[11.724175, 14.159067, 0.34119228]","[5.404225, 1.9588196, 0.2742793]"

The relationships between periodicities are then used to find the metrical hierarchy and to estimate the tempo at the beat and measure levels of the hierarchy. The periodicities are then interpreted as musical note values, and the estimated tempo, meter and the distribution of periodicities are used to predict the style of music using a simple set of rules.

SONNET-MAP is a synthesis of the SONNET (Self-Organizing Neural Network) architecture (Nigrin, 1993) and an associative map derived from ARTMAP (Carpenter, Grossberg, and Reynolds, 1991). SONNET-MAP automatically segments a melody based on pitch and rhythmic grouping cues. Separate SONNET modules represent the pitch and rhythm dimensions of each segmented phrase independently, with two associative maps fusing these representations at the phrase level. Further SONNET modules aggregate these phrases forming a hierarchical memory structure that encompasses the entire melody. In addition, melodic queries may be used to retrieve any encoded melody.

Actual musical patterns, although constantly transformed, are nevertheless perceived by the listener as musical identities. Such dynamical properties of human perception, not reducible to geometrical models, will only be explained with the notions of contexts and expectations. This paper sketches the general principles of a new approach that attempts to build such a general perceptual system. On a sub-cognitive level, patterns are discovered through the detection, by an associative memory, of local similarities. On a cognitive level, patterns are managed by a general logical framework that avoids irrelevant inferences and combinatorial explosion. In this way, actual musical patterns that convey musical significance are discovered.

One of the frustrations for libraries, archives, and patrons alike is the gulf between the information about a holding and actual access to it. But users are not the only ones to have an opinion about free access. Local musicians feel that everyone profits from their cultural heritage but them; researchers find themselves held responsible for research recordings made decades earlier and largely forgotten; and some communities seek to protect music that was never meant to be commercialized, and is considered to be secret or divine. Caught in the middle between angry patrons, angry companies, and angry artists, what are music librarians and archivists supposed to do? Using his own experience as a researcher, archivist, and record producer, the author discusses the issues and makes some suggestions that can help those who wish to use the music they can so easily find out about. It is a great honor to be with you at the ISMIR 2003. I have devoted much of my life to making information available for eventual retrieval, and it is nice to be among specialists in doing just that. As a researcher, I have made field recordings among indigenous peoples in remote jungles of Brazil. As the director of an audiovisual archive I wanted to make available as much information as possible about the collections by publishing printed catalogs, entering collection-level information on OCLC, creating in-house databases, and revising depositors’ contracts. As a record company director I have produced hundreds of CDs with extensive liner notes, maintained a vast back catalog in print, and moved early to supplying information on the Internet. As the archival consultant to the Smithsonian Institution's GlobalSound Internet music project, I have continued to search for new ways to make information about music, and music itself, available to as wide a public as we can reach. A huge amount of music is available on the Internet today, and even more music is signaled in myriad archives catalogues. More will music will certainly become available. One problem we face is finding what is there (and also what isn’t). Another problem is finding out how we may use it. The short summary of my talk would be: although you can find it, a variety of forces (not all of them related to greed) shape the way music should be used. As specialists in information retrieval, we must also become specialists in helping others learn not only the techniques of finding music, but also the ethics of using it.",USA,facility,Developed economies,"[3.0698695, 49.036644]","[34.48436, 13.653086]","[29.66375, 4.920314, 8.684582]","[-3.9078639, 3.9320972, 25.728718]","[13.470885, 7.4597974]","[4.696367, 1.5478218]","[13.382031, 15.636855, 1.1575124]","[5.038704, 1.8889323, 0.6038159]"

To improve this situation we propose a model for recognition of music that enables identification and comparison of musical documents without dependence on their actual instantiation.

Ellis+Columbia University>USA>education,"Automatic extraction of content description from commercial audio recordings has a number of important applications, from indexing and retrieval through to novel musicological analyses based on very large corpora of recorded performances. Chord sequences are a description that captures much of the character of a piece in a compact form and using a modest lexicon. Chords also have the attractive property that a piece of music can (mostly) be segmented into time intervals that consist of a single chord, much as recorded speech can (mostly) be segmented into time intervals that correspond to specific words. In this work, we build a system for automatic chord transcription using speech recognition tools. For features we use “pitch class profile” vectors to emphasize the tonal content of the signal, and we show that these features far outperform cepstral coefficients for our task. Sequence recognition is accomplished with hidden Markov models (HMMs) directly analogous to subword models in a speech recognizer, and trained by the same Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Crucially, this allows us to use as input only the chord sequences for our training examples, without requiring the precise timings of the chord changes — which are determined automatically during training.

But without a large corpus of real-world music transcribed at the note level, these algorithms are unable to take advantage of supervised learning methods and also have difficulty reporting a quantitative metric of their performance, such as a Note Error Rate. We attempt to remedy this situation by taking advantage of publicly-available MIDI transcriptions. By force-aligning synthesized audio generated from a MIDI transcription with the raw audio of the song it represents we can correlate note events within the MIDI data with the precise time in the raw audio where that note is likely to be expressed. Having these alignments will support the creation of a polyphonic transcription system based on labeled segments of produced music. But because the MIDI transcriptions we find are of variable quality, an integral step in the process is automatically evaluating the integrity of the alignment before using the transcription as part of any training set of labeled examples. Comparing a library of 40 published songs to freely available MIDI files, we were able to align 31 (78%).

This enables us to measure similarity by using the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) and the Proportional Transportation Distance (PTD), a pseudo-metric for weighted point sets which is based on the EMD. A comparison of our experiment results with earlier work shows that by using weighted point sets and the EMD/PTD instead of Howard’s method (1998) using the DARMS encoding for determining melodic similarity, it is possible to group together about twice as many known occurrences of a melody within the RISM A/II collection.

Although such research suggests that the criterion for similarity judgement varies with respect to the musical style of the content being compared, the specific musical factors which shape this criterion are unknown. Since dimensional complexity differentiates musical genres, and has been shown to affect similarity judgements following lifelong exposure, this experiment investigates the short-term influence of dimensional complexity on similarity judgements. Rhythmic and pitch sequences with two levels of complexity were factorially combined to create four distinct types of prototype melodies. 51 participants rated the similarity of each type of prototype melody (M) to two variations, one in which the pitch content was modified ( ¯ Mp), and another in which the rhythmic content was modified ( ¯ Mr). The results indicate that rhythm and pitch complexity both play a significant role, influencing the perceived similarity of ¯ Mp, and ¯ Mr. The dimension bearing low complexity information was found to be the predominant factor in similarity judgements, as participants found modifications to this dimension to significantly decrease perceived similarity.",CAN,education,Developed economies,"[17.108694, -2.640388]","[4.5131307, 38.639732]","[5.4541354, 11.860744, -8.410026]","[3.7548857, 7.066813, 7.874338]","[11.68131, 10.284197]","[7.2567043, 2.7095835]","[10.685535, 16.13284, 2.1052496]","[6.489649, 2.9869313, -1.6810886]"

It is therefore of much interest in pedagogy to understand what ungrammaticality might mean in the context of a given raga, and possibly develop means to detect this in an audio recording of the raga performance. One prominent notion is that ungrammaticality is considered to occur only when the performer “treads” on another, possibly allied, raga in a listener’s perception. With this view, we consider modeling the technical boundary of a raga as that which separates it from another raga that is closest to it in its distinctive features. We wish to find computational models that can indicate ungrammaticality using a data-driven estimation of the model parameters; i.e. the raga performances of great artists are used to obtain representations that discriminate most between same and different raga performances.

This process is labor intensive and time consuming, and consequently existing annotated datasets are very limited in size. In this paper we propose a framework for automatically generating continuous f0 annotations without requiring manual refinement: the estimate of a pitch tracker is used to drive an analysis/synthesis pipeline which produces a synthesized version of the track. Any estimation errors are now reflected in the synthesized audio, meaning the tracker’s output represents an accurate annotation. Analysis is performed using a wide-band harmonic sinusoidal modeling algorithm which estimates the frequency, amplitude and phase of every harmonic, meaning the synthesized track closely resembles the original in terms of timbre and dynamics. Finally the synthesized track is automatically mixed back into the multitrack. The framework can be used to annotate multitrack datasets for training learning-based algorithms. Furthermore, we show that algorithms evaluated on the automatically generated/annotated mixes produce results that are statistically indistinguishable from those they produce on the original, manually annotated, mixes.

These recordings are contiguous segments of music where the soloist part is active. Based on this input, the system identifies the corresponding passages within a full-mix recording of the same piece (i.e. contains both solo and accompaniment parts), and these passages are temporally warped to run synchronously to the solo-only recordings. The warped passages can serve as accompaniment tracks for the user to play along with at a tempo that matches his or her ability or desired interpretation.

We found multiple statistically significant dimensions of stimulus-response correlation (SRC) for all songs studied.

However, as there is no formal ground truth as to what these variations should look like, it is a challenge to provide and validate analysis methods for this.

This enables using statistics for analyzing tempo variations in collections of performances. We elaborate the computation and interpretation of the mean variation and the principal modes of variation.

In this paper, we focus on the description of chord sequences and we study a specific set of graph configurations, called Primer Preserving Permutations (PPP). For sequences of 16 chords, PPPs account for 6 different latent systems of relations, corresponding to 6 main structural patterns (Prototypical Carrier Sequences or PCS). Observed chord sequences can be viewed as distorted versions of these PCS and the corresponding optimal PPP is estimated by minimizing a description cost over the latent relations. After presenting the main concepts of this approach, the article provides a detailed study of PPPs across a corpus of 727 chord sequences annotated from the RWC POP database (100 pop songs).

Early lessons typically target the mastering of individual strokes from the inventory of bols (spoken syllables corresponding to the distinct strokes) via training in the required articulatory gestures on the right and left drums. Exploiting the close links between the articulation, acoustics and perception of tabla strokes, this paper presents a study of the different timbral qualities that correspond to the correct articulation and to identified common misarticulations of the different bols. We present a dataset created out of correctly articulated and distinct categories of misarticulated strokes, all perceptually verified by an expert. We obtain a system that automatically labels a recording as a good or bad sound, and additionally identifies the precise nature of the misarticulation with a view to providing corrective feedback to the player. We find that acoustic features that are sensitive to the relatively small deviations from the good sound due to poorly articulated strokes are not necessarily the features that have proved successful in the recognition of strokes corresponding to distinct tabla bols as required for music transcription.",IND,education,Developing economies,"[-33.295864, -30.119932]","[-27.000437, -2.9719322]","[-27.82613, -14.640092, 1.2270178]","[-0.2357818, -14.0716505, 0.14621018]","[6.8460765, 8.074909]","[9.317837, 1.8344505]","[9.50476, 11.8627825, 1.5744517]","[8.783563, 4.250828, 1.2638797]"

We propose a machine learning model for chord recognition that uses semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields (semi-CRFs) to perform a joint segmentation and labeling of symbolic music. One benefit of using a semi-Markov model is that it enables the utilization of segment-level features, such as segment purity and chord coverage, that capture the extent to which the events in an entire segment of music are compatible with a candidate chord label. Correspondingly, we develop a rich set of segment-level features for a semi-CRF model that also incorporates the likelihood of a large number of chord-to-chord transitions. Evaluations on a dataset of Bach chorales and a corpus of theme and variations for piano by Beethoven and Mozart show that the proposed semi-CRF model outperforms a discriminatively trained Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that does sequential labeling of sounding events, thus demonstrating the suitability of semi-Markov models for joint segmentation and labeling of music.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-48.38888, -38.157207]","[-24.634325, -37.188477]","[-38.515057, -9.227323, 5.4712663]","[-18.521635, 15.43604, -8.018684]","[5.8084164, 9.016711]","[11.55858, 3.8473628]","[8.337042, 12.078352, 2.508049]","[9.100202, 3.9194016, -1.6325516]"

This requires additional domain knowledge not used by the estimation algorithm, which is rarely available. Therefore we move our focus to defining confidence measures for hidden Markov models, a technique used in multiple music information retrieval systems and beyond. We propose two measures that are oblivious to the specific labelling task, trading off performance for computational requirements.

This suggests the possibility of correcting (or realigning) preliminary results by a fast (but not-so-accurate) alignment method with a refined method applied to limited segments of aligned signals, to save the computational cost. To realise this, we develop a method for detecting performance errors and a realignment method that works fast and accurately in local regions around performance errors. To remove the dependence on prior voice information, voice separation is performed to the reference signal in the local regions.

Given only a description of the pieces in text format (i.e. no score information is provided), a reference database is automatically compiled by acquiring a number of audio representations (performances of the pieces) from internet sources. These are transcribed, preprocessed, and used to build a reference database via a robust symbolic fingerprinting algorithm, which in turn is used to identify new, incoming queries. The main challenge is the amount of noise that is introduced into the identification process by the music transcription algorithm and the automatic (but possibly suboptimal) choice of performances to represent a piece in the reference database. In a number of experiments we show how to improve the identification performance by increasing redundancy in the reference database and by using a preprocessing step to rate the reference performances regarding their suitability as a representation of the pieces in question. As the results show this approach leads to a robust system that is able to identify piano music with high accuracy – without any need for data annotation or manual data preparation.",AUT,education,Developed economies,"[-25.452608, 5.3521423]","[13.750338, -26.418411]","[-7.2987566, -12.276694, 2.903072]","[3.7220147, -10.440431, 10.492285]","[9.9619, 7.3847346]","[8.459381, 0.9695892]","[11.396488, 13.657793, 0.25336716]","[7.4704943, 1.971565, -0.037765205]"

Since the onset times and F0s of sung notes are considerably deviated from the discrete tatums and pitches indicated in a musical score, a score model is crucial for improving time-frequency quantization of the F0s. We thus propose a hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model (HHSMM) that combines a score model representing the rhythms and pitches of musical notes with musical scales with an F0 model representing time-frequency deviations from a note sequence specified by a score. In the score model, musical scales are generated stochastically. Note pitches are then generated according to the scales and note onsets are generated according to a Markov process defined on the tatum grid. In the F0 model, onset deviations, smooth note-to-note F0 transitions, and F0 deviations are generated stochastically and added to the note sequence. Given an F0 trajectory, our method estimates the most likely sequence of musical notes while giving more importance on the score model than the F0 model.

Using training data restricted to American English speech, we evaluate different methods involving the deduced L1-specific (native language) rules for singing. In the absence of L1 phone models, we incorporate the derived pronunciation variations in the ASR framework via a novel approach that combines acoustic models for sub-phonetic segments to represent the missing L1 phones.

The metric reports the differences between two music scores based on twelve aspects: barlines, clefs, key signatures, time signatures, notes, note spelling, note durations, stem directions, groupings, rests, rest duration, and staff assignment.

For example, used as a way to represent expressive timing, tempo curves can be regressed by a polynomial function such that the number of regressed polynomial coefficients remains constant with a given order regardless of phrase lengths. In this paper, clustering the regressed polynomial coefficients is proposed for expressive timing analysis. A model selection test is presented to compare Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) fitting regressed polynomial coefficients and fitting expressive timing directly. As there are no expected results of clustering expressive timing, the proposed method is demonstrated by how well the expressive timing are approximated by the centroids of GMMs. The results show that GMMs fitting the regressed polynomial coefficients outperform GMMs fitting expressive timing directly. This conclusion suggests that it is possible to use regressed polynomial coefficients to represent expressive timing within a phrase and cluster expressive timing within phrases of different lengths.",CHN,education,Developing economies,"[-24.520678, 23.93668]","[-9.676058, -20.206032]","[3.6786542, 0.41314858, 23.613136]","[-9.423424, -19.146246, -3.1631274]","[10.811133, 7.2185855]","[10.7165365, 1.369664]","[11.852133, 13.6272, 0.85626334]","[9.653, 2.8980937, 1.1134027]"

We first investigate genre recognition and present evidence that incorporating discourse features allow for more accurate genre classification than single-sentence lyric features do. Similarly, we examine the problem of release date estimation by passing features to classifiers to determine the release period of a particular song, and again determine that an assistance from discourse-based features allow for superior classification relative to single-sentence lyric features alone.

This approach, however, cannot explicitly describe the rhythms, harmonic functions (e.g., tonic, dominant, and subdominant), and the hierarchical structure of chords, which are supposedly important in traditional harmony theories. To solve this, we formulate a hierarchical generative model consisting of (1) a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) for chords incorporating their syntactic functions, (2) a metrical Markov model describing chord rhythms, and (3) a Markov model generating melodies conditionally on a chord sequence. To estimate a variable-length chord sequence for a given melody, we iteratively refine the latent tree structure and the chord symbols and rhythms using a Metropolis-Hastings sampler with split-merge operations.

This paper introduces novel frameworks for quantifying similarities between ragas based on their melodic attributes alone, available in the form of bandish (composition) notation. Based on the hypothesis that notes in a particular raga are characterized by the company they keep, we design and train several deep recursive neural network variants with Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) units to learn distributed representations of notes in ragas from bandish notations. We refer to these distributed representations as note-embeddings. Note-embeddings, as we observe, capture a raga’s identity, and thus the similarity between note-embeddings signifies the similarity between the ragas. Evaluations with perplexity measure and clustering based method show the performance improvement in identifying similarities using note-embeddings over n-gram and uni-directional LSTM baselines.

This is a challenging problem since the melodic sounds (typically vocal and violin) generate soft-onset locations which result in a number of false alarms. In this work, a separation-driven onset detection approach is proposed. Percussive separation is performed using a Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) in the first stage. A single model is used to separate the percussive vs the non-percussive sounds using discriminative training and time-frequency masking. This is then followed by an onset detection stage based on group delay (GD) processing on the separated percussive track. The proposed approach is evaluated on a large dataset of live Carnatic music concert recordings and compared against percussive separation and onset detection baselines. The separation performance is significantly better than that of Harmonic-Percussive Separation (HPS) algorithm and onset detection performance is better than the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based algorithm. The proposed approach has an absolute improvement of 18.4% compared with the detection algorithm applied directly on the composition items.",IND,education,Developing economies,"[-42.300343, -12.140442]","[-30.811352, -20.286266]","[-6.911594, -19.282389, -4.833454]","[0.9758136, -16.279099, -12.027915]","[8.573951, 6.074863]","[11.116872, 2.2430856]","[11.26201, 11.7554035, 0.0031906052]","[9.736976, 4.056095, 1.2301803]"

In this paper, we present a novel approach to tackle the cover song identification problem from a new perspective. We first construct a set of core songs, and represent each song in a high-dimensional space where each dimension indicates the pairwise distance between the given song and the other in the pre-defined core set. There are several advantages to this. First, using a number of reference songs in the core set, we make the most of relative distances to many other songs. Second, as all songs are transformed into the same high-dimensional space, kernel methods and metric learning are exploited for distance computation. Third, our approach does not depend on the computation method for the pairwise distance, and thus can use any existing algorithms.

Based on the improvements brought by using data fusion methods to find the consensus of algorithms on other MIR tasks, we hypothesize that fusing the output from musical pattern discovery algorithms will improve the pattern discovery results. In this paper, we explore two methods to combine the pattern output from ten state-of-the-art algorithms using two datasets. Both provide human-annotated patterns as ground truth. We show that finding the consensus among the output of different musical pattern discovery algorithms is challenging for two reasons: First, the number of patterns found by the algorithms exceeds patterns in human annotations by several orders of magnitude, with little agreement on what constitutes a pattern. Second, the algorithms perform inconsistently across different pieces. We show that algorithms lack a consensus with each other. Therefore, it is difficult to harness the collective wisdom of the algorithms to find ground truth patterns. The main contribution of this paper is a meta-analysis of the (dis)similarities among pattern discovery algorithms’ output and using the output in two fusion methods.

To automatically detect these mistakes, a first idea is to use a music transcription method to detect notes played in an audio recording and to compare the results with a corresponding score. However, as the number of transcription errors produced by standard methods is often considerably higher than the number of actual mistakes, the results are often of limited use. In contrast, our method exploits that the score already provides rough information about what we seek to detect in the audio, which allows us to construct a tailored transcription method. In particular, we employ score-informed source separation techniques to learn for each score pitch a set of templates capturing the spectral properties of that pitch. After extrapolating the resulting template dictionary to pitches not in the score, we estimate the activity of each MIDI pitch over time.

We present the argument that chroma vectors potentially hold enough information to model harmonic content of audio for chord recognition, but that standard chroma extractors compute too noisy features. This leads us to propose a learned chroma feature extractor based on artificial neural networks. It is trained to compute chroma features that encode harmonic information important for chord recognition, while being robust to irrelevant interferences. We achieve this by feeding the network an audio spectrum with context instead of a single frame as input. This way, the network can learn to selectively compensate noise and resolve harmonic ambiguities. We compare the resulting features to hand-crafted ones by using a simple linear frame-wise classifier for chord recognition on various data sets.

Computationally modelling this phenomenon is an open problem, especially when processing expressive shaping of the music such as tempo change. To meet this challenge we propose Adaptive Frequency Neural Networks (AFNNs), an extension of Gradient Frequency Neural Networks (GFNNs). GFNNs are based on neurodynamic models and have been applied successfully to a range of difficult music perception problems including those with syncopated and polyrhythmic stimuli. AFNNs extend GFNNs by applying a Hebbian learning rule to the oscillator frequencies. Thus the frequencies in an AFNN adapt to the stimulus through an attraction to local areas of resonance, and allow for a great dimensionality reduction in the network. Where previous work with GFNNs has focused on frequency and amplitude responses, we also consider phase information as critical for pulse perception. Evaluating the time-based output, we find significantly improved responses of AFNNs compared to GFNNs to stimuli with both steady and varying pulse frequencies. This leads us to believe that AFNNs could replace the linear filtering methods commonly used in beat tracking and tempo estimation systems, and lead to more accurate methods.",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[-55.719326, -9.404549]","[-27.733397, -14.320712]","[-2.2293954, -24.40064, -3.837146]","[-0.5508833, -18.787119, -16.99921]","[9.333607, 5.1599083]","[11.663411, 1.955359]","[12.283687, 11.627063, 0.62138724]","[9.752041, 3.9687989, 1.7932796]"

In this paper, we extract a large range of features from this dataset, including specialised descriptors of pressedness and breathiness, to analyse their explanatory power and robustness against changes of pitch and vowel.

Applying feature selection based on mutual information and retaining the nine highest ranked features as input to a NN results in a mean F-measure of 0.78, demonstrating the suitability of these features to discriminate between phonation modes.

Then, we aggregate the resulting composite estimator with four popular state-of-the-art methods based on chromas as well as timbre sequences.

One of the best ways to compute this separation, as proposed by Chew and Wu in 2005, is to first identify contigs that are portions of the music score with a constant number of voices, then to progressively connect these contigs. This raises two questions: Which contigs should be connected first? And, how should these two contigs be connected? Here we propose to answer simultaneously these two questions by considering a set of musical features that measures the quality of any connection. The coefficients weighting the features are optimized through a genetic algorithm. We benchmark the resulting connection policy on corpora containing fugues of the Well-Tempered Clavier by J. S.

This permits the modeling and unsupervised separation of vibrato or glissando musical sources, which is not possible with the basic matrix factorization formulation. The algorithm factorizes a sparse nonnegative tensor comprising the audio spectrogram and local frequency-slope-to-frequency ratios, which are estimated at each time-frequency bin using the Distributed Derivative Method. The use of local frequency modulations as separation cues is motivated by the principle of common fate partial grouping from Auditory Scene Analysis, which hypothesizes that each latent source in a mixture is characterized perceptually by coherent frequency and amplitude modulations shared by its component partials.

A common strategy is to proceed in a two-step fashion. First, a fundamental frequency (F0) trajectory for the musical voice that is likely to exhibit vibrato is estimated. In a second step, the trajectory is then analyzed with respect to periodic frequency modulations. As a major drawback, however, such a method cannot recover from errors made in the inherently difficult first step, which severely limits the performance during the second step. In this work, we present a novel vibrato analysis approach that avoids the first error-prone F0-estimation step. Our core idea is to perform the analysis directly on a signal’s spectrogram representation where vibrato is evident in the form of characteristic spectro-temporal patterns. We detect and parameterize these patterns by locally comparing the spectrogram with a predefined set of vibrato templates. Our systematic experiments indicate that this approach is more robust than F0-based strategies.",DEU,facility,Developed economies,"[-26.62279, -35.160923]","[-9.182585, -44.498417]","[-32.649883, 2.9727228, -11.26231]","[-0.8475709, 14.569623, -13.3270645]","[9.003135, 7.5979304]","[10.117692, 2.5479903]","[10.316893, 13.601929, 0.2724519]","[9.381937, 3.5970166, -0.049936987]"

In current music creation contexts, it is common for users to search for and use loops shared in online repositories. These loops are typically not produced by professionals and lack annotations. Hence, the existence of reliable tempo estimation algorithms becomes necessary to enhance the reusability of loops shared in such repositories. In this paper, we test six existing tempo estimation algorithms against four music loop datasets containing more than 35k loops.

A popular approach to multipitch analysis is to perform nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for estimating the temporal activations of semitone-level pitches and then execute thresholding for making a piano-roll representation. The major problems of this cascading approach are that an optimal threshold is hard to determine for each musical piece and that musically inappropriate pitch combinations are allowed to appear. To solve these problems, we propose a probabilistic generative model that fuses an acoustic model (NMF) for a music spectrogram with a language model (hidden Markov model; HMM) for pitch locations in a hierarchical Bayesian manner. More specifically, binary variables indicating the existences of pitches are introduced into the framework of NMF. The latent grammatical structures of those variables are regulated by an HMM that encodes chord progressions and pitch co-occurrences (chord components). Given a music spectrogram, all the latent variables (pitches and chords) are estimated jointly by using Gibbs sampling.

A basic assumption of the system is that humans understand rhythm by letting salient periodicities in the music act as a framework, upon which the rhythmical structure is interpreted. Therefore, the system estimates the cepstroid (the most salient periodicity of the music), and uses a neural network that is invariant with regards to the cepstroid length. The input of the network consists mainly of features that capture onset characteristics along time, such as spectral differences. The invariant properties of the network are achieved by subsampling the input vectors with a hop size derived from a musically relevant subdivision of the computed cepstroid of each song. The output is filtered to detect relevant periodicities and then used in conjunction with two additional networks, which estimates the speed and tempo of the music, to predict the final beat positions.

We first align them to the matching textual lyrics using an acoustic model trained on speech. We then use the resulting phoneme alignment to train new acoustic models using only subsets of the DAMP singing data. These models are then tested for phoneme recognition and, on top of that, keyword spotting. Evaluation is performed for different subsets of DAMP and for an unrelated set of the vocal tracks of commercial pop songs.

To improve the robustness of pitch estimation, experiments show that it is beneficial to measure pitch saliency by jointly considering frequency, periodicity and harmonicity information.

However, from a practical viewpoint of beginner players, it is more important to minimize the maximum difficulty of a move required for playing the phrase, that is, to make the most difficult move easier. To this end, we introduce a variant of the Viterbi algorithm (termed the “minimax Viterbi algorithm”) that finds the path of the hidden states that maximizes the minimum transition probability (not the product of the transition probabilities) and apply it to HMM-based guitar fingering decision. We compare the resulting fingerings by the conventional Viterbi algorithm and our proposed minimax Viterbi algorithm to show the appropriateness of our new method.",JPN,education,Developed economies,"[-36.954037, -36.917797]","[-22.20067, 3.1778214]","[-31.035894, -3.928731, 9.764507]","[-15.467797, 1.1055583, -3.8509488]","[6.6471677, 8.61936]","[9.716357, 4.315443]","[9.101757, 12.185586, 1.8966678]","[8.71628, 4.022986, 0.96942633]"

Since considerable effort has been devoted to estimate the frame-level F0s of singing voices from music audio signals, we tackle musical note estimation for those F0s to obtain a symbolic musical score. A naïve approach to musical note estimation is to quantize the vocal F0s at a semitone level in every time unit (e.g., half beat). This approach, however, fails when the vocal F0s are significantly deviated from those specified by a musical score. The onsets of musical notes are often delayed or advanced from beat times and the vocal F0s fluctuate according to singing expressions. To deal with these deviations, we propose a Bayesian hidden Markov model that allows musical notes to change in semi-synchronization with beat times. Both the semitone-level F0s and onset deviations of musical notes are regarded as latent variables and the frequency deviations are modeled by an emission distribution. The musical notes and their onset and frequency deviations are jointly estimated by using Gibbs sampling.

This guides segmentation and also lets us group basis sets for NMF. The number of sources, the types of sources, and when the sources are active are not known in advance. The only information is a specific type of layering structure. There is no separate training phase to learn a good basis set. No prior seeding of the NMF matrices is required. Unlike standard approaches to NMF there is no need for a post-processor to partition the learned basis functions by group. Source groups are learned automatically from the data.

Intabulating involved deciding what to omit from a score to fit the instrument, and making it fit under the hand.

Here we test whether such patterns are both characteristic of lute intabulations as a class (vs original lute music) and of different genres within that class. We use patterns identified in the musicological literature to search two annotated corpora of encoded lute music using the SIA(M)ESE algorithm. Diatonic patterns occur in many chromatic forms, accidentals being added depending how the arranger applied the conventions of musica ficta. Rhythms must be applied at three different scales as notation is inconsistent across the repertory.

Since many aspects of structural annotations are highly regular, but few of these regularities are taken into account by current algorithms, we propose several methods of improving predictions of musical structure by using their likelihood according to prior distributions. We test the use of priors to improve a committee of basic segmentation algorithms, and to improve a committee of cutting-edge approaches submitted to MIREX. In both cases, we are unable to improve on the best committee member, meaning that our proposed approach is outperformed by simple parameter tuning. The same negative result was found despite incorporating the priors in multiple ways. To explain the result, we show that although there is a correlation overall between output accuracy and prior likelihood, the weakness of the correlation in the high-likelihood region makes the proposed method infeasible.

The spectrogram of a musical audio signal is modelled as the sum of the leading voice (produced by human voice or pitched musical instruments) and accompaniment. The leading voice is then modelled with a Smoothed Instantaneous Mixture Model (SIMM) based on a source-filter model. The main advantage of such a pitch salience function is that it enhances the leading voice even without explicitly separating it from the rest of the signal. We show that this is beneficial for melody extraction, increasing pitch estimation accuracy and reducing octave errors in comparison with simpler pitch salience functions.

To this end, we apply a stochastic sequential model of simple decisions, the drift-diffusion model (DDM), to understand risky decision behavior. Numerous studies have demonstrated that mood can affect emotional and cognitive processing, but the exact nature of the impact music has on decision making in quantitative tasks has not been sufficiently studied. In our experiment, participants decided whether to accept or reject multiple bets with different risk vs. reward ratios while listening to music that was chosen to induce positive or negative mood. Our results indicate that music indeed alters people’s behavior in a surprising way - happy music made people make better choices. In other words, it made people more likely to accept good bets and reject bad bets. The DDM decomposition indicated the effect focused primarily on both the caution and the information processing aspects of decision making. To further understand the correspondence between auditory features and decision making, we studied how individual aspects of music affect response patterns. Our results are particularly interesting when compared with recent results regarding the impact of music on emotional processing, as they illustrate that music affects analytical decision making in a fundamentally different way, hinting at a different psychological mechanism that music impacts.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[36.271336, 17.330555]","[31.402084, 42.34414]","[20.240131, 25.558146, -9.185329]","[8.217678, 2.8778756, 36.751152]","[14.064113, 9.866658]","[3.618327, 3.0842927]","[12.507134, 17.183376, 1.8128048]","[3.8537154, 2.969759, 0.98219407]"

Building on the type theory in information theory (Cover & Thomas 2006), we use a Bayesian generative model of musical features and compute the typicality of a song as the sum of the probabilities of the songs that share the type of the given song. To evaluate estimated results, we focused on vocal timbre which can be evaluated quantitatively by using the singer’s gender. Estimated typicality is evaluated against the Pearson correlation coefficient between the computed typicality and the ratio of the number of male singers to female singers of a song-set.

In this paper, we propose the time-delayed melody surface (TDMS), a novel feature based on delay coordinates that captures the melodic outline of a r¯aga. A TDMS describes both the tonal and the temporal characteristics of a melody, using only an estimation of the predominant pitch. Considering a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier, TDMSs outperform the state-of-the-art for r¯aga recognition by a large margin. We obtain 98% accuracy on a Hindustani music dataset of 300 recordings and 30 r¯agas, and 87% accuracy on a Carnatic music dataset of 480 recordings and 40 r¯agas. TDMSs are simple to implement, fast to compute, and have a musically meaningful interpretation. Since the concepts and formulation behind the TDMS are generic and widely applicable, we envision its usage in other music traditions beyond Indian art music.",ESP,education,Developed economies,"[14.522869, -28.987162]","[-4.447572, 1.2074056]","[-4.567894, -3.7018433, -22.74921]","[2.1623185, -9.711167, 3.3609378]","[9.649717, 11.09683]","[8.989358, 1.6609716]","[9.350786, 15.395222, 2.8095076]","[8.836366, 2.1959987, -0.52808756]"

However, existing transcription systems that have been described in research papers typically focus on multi-F0 estimation from audio and only output notes in absolute terms, showing frequency and absolute time (a piano-roll representation), but not in musical terms, with spelling distinctions (e.g., A♭ versus G♯) and quantized meter. To complete the transcription process, one would need to convert the piano-roll representation into a properly formatted and musically meaningful musical score. This process is non-trivial and largely unresearched. In this paper we present a system that generates music notation output from human-recorded MIDI performances of piano music. We show that the correct estimation of the meter, harmony and streams in a piano performance provides a solid foundation to produce a properly formatted score.

In this work, supervised learning is used to train a PCFG for the task of melodic reduction, using the tree analyses provided by the GTTM dataset.

The automatic separation of music into voices is complicated by the fact that music spans a voice-leading continuum ranging from monophonic, to homophonic, to polyphonic, often within the same work. We address this diversity by defining voice separation as the task of partitioning music into streams that exhibit both a high degree of external perceptual separation from the other streams and a high degree of internal perceptual consistency, to the maximum degree that is possible in the given musical input. Equipped with this task definition, we manually annotated a corpus of popular music and used it to train a neural network with one hidden layer that is connected to a diverse set of perceptually informed input features. The trained neural model greedily assigns notes to voices in a left to right traversal of the input chord sequence.

Although such a system may have a wider range of applications, it was mainly developed to become the acoustic module of a query-by-humming (QBH) system for retrieving pieces of music from a digitized musical library. The first part of the paper is devoted to the systematic evaluation of a variety of state-of-the art transcription systems. The main result of this evaluation is that there is clearly a need for more accurate systems. Especially the segmentation was experienced as being too error prone (20% segmentation errors). In the second part of the paper, a new auditory model based transcription system is proposed and evaluated. The results of that evaluation are very promising. Segmentation errors vary between 0 and 7%, dependent on the amount of lyrics that is used by the singer. The paper ends with the description of an experimental study that was issued to demonstrate that the accuracy of the newly proposed transcription system is not very sensitive to the choice of the free parameters, at least as long as they remain in the vicinity of the values one could forecast on the basis of their meaning.""",BEL,education,Developed economies,"[-0.12379759, -38.474518]","[-6.107852, -41.487076]","[-16.184174, -10.3102455, -17.411875]","[-1.3867762, 13.087678, -18.195402]","[8.369572, 11.409702]","[9.598941, 2.2933688]","[8.438402, 14.8438635, 0.7751724]","[9.051199, 3.2921994, -0.47129685]"

In this paper, we describe several attempts to construct a full matrix of similarity measures between a set of some 400 popular artists by regularizing limited subjective judgment data. We also detail our attempts to evaluate these measures by comparison with direct subjective similarity judgments collected via a web-based survey in April 2002.

One difference between Carnatic music and the better-known Hindusthani music of North India is its embeddedness in a religious-philosophical context. This context crucially determines the objects of knowledge organization and the indigenous theory of musical affect. The author presents the view that a digital library of Carnatic music should contain the objects of knowledge organization and their interrelationships as conceived by indigenous practitioners and audiences, rather than by Western specialists or North Indian practitioners. The author demonstrates how three features of Carnatic music (viz. aural transmission, improvisation and cultural context) have particular implications for the development of a digital library. Aural transmission results in musical documents being less important sources of information than recordings. Improvisation results in a highly transformational and often ambiguous relationship between (intra)musical signifiers and signified, causing problems of classification and machine recognition. The cultural context favours the prioritisation of emotional affect over introductory ease of listening and even technical recording quality in the selection of the recordings to be included in a digital library of Carnatic music.",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[15.214397, -27.050179]","[-2.072383, 1.9042126]","[-2.1699111, -0.9918349, -21.833702]","[-0.48301968, -11.96731, 7.993464]","[9.780164, 11.043716]","[9.062322, 1.6893823]","[9.5020895, 15.452928, 2.7671854]","[8.91518, 2.1803138, -0.51766145]"

Papipuun performs quick listening in a manner similar to a stylus skipping on a scratched record, but the skipping occurs correctly at punctuations of musical phrases, not arbitrarily. First, we developed a method for representing polyphony based on time-span reduction in the generative theory of tonal music (GTTM) and the deductive object-oriented database (DOOD). The operation, least upper bound, plays an important role in similarity checking of polyphonies represented in our method. Next, in a preprocessing phase, a user analyzes a set piece by the time-span reduction, using a dedicated tool called TS-Editor.

Hoos+Darmstadt University of Technology>DEU>education|University of British Columbia>CAN>education,"Voice separation, along with tempo detection and quantisation, is one of the basic problems of computer-based transcription of music. An adequate separation of notes into different voices is crucial for obtaining readable and usable scores from performances of polyphonic music recorded on keyboard (or other polyphonic) instruments; for improving quantisation results within a transcription system; and in the context of music retrieval systems that primarily support monophonic queries. In this paper we propose a new voice separation algorithm based on a stochastic local search method. Different from many previous approaches, our algorithm allows chords in the individual voices; its behaviour is controlled by a small number of intuitive and musically motivated parameters; and it is fast enough to allow interactive optimisation of the result by adjusting the parameters in real-time. We demonstrate that compared to existing approaches, our new algorithm generates better solutions for a number of typical voice separation problems. We also show how by changing its parameters it is possible to create score output suitable for different needs, piano-style orchestral scores.",DEU,education,Developed economies,"[-8.622125, -44.81365]","[-42.670376, -20.606243]","[-16.455248, -25.520424, 7.415184]","[-9.128707, -3.3400843, -33.147377]","[7.599213, 11.169445]","[10.442667, 4.972038]","[8.20664, 14.330914, 0.006841566]","[8.639114, 5.605612, 0.4268059]"

The main drawback in most of the offline algorithms is the space the indexing structure requires. The amount of data stored into the structure can however be reduced by storing only the suitable index terms or phrases instead of the whole contents of the database. Repetition is agreed to be one of the most important factors of musical meaningfulness. Therefore repetitive musical phrases are suitable for indexing purposes. The extraction of such phrases can be done by applying an existing text mining method to musical data. Because of the differences between text and musical data the application requires some technical modification of the method. This paper introduces a text mining-based music database indexing method that extracts maximal frequent phrases from musical data and sorts them by their length, frequency and personality. The implementation of the method found three different types of phrases from the test corpus consisting of Irish folk music tunes. The suitable two types of phrases out of three are easily recognized and separated from the set of all phrases to form an index data for the database.",FIN,education,Developed economies,"[12.717819, 14.130127]","[32.46286, -8.562843]","[9.046744, -2.5938294, -6.3434157]","[17.39672, -3.6595948, 10.776936]","[12.371281, 9.097071]","[6.828841, 2.036924]","[11.217989, 16.258394, 0.22732417]","[6.2463512, 2.424959, -0.7228114]"

In our system, melody feature of music database and humming is not represented by distinct note information but by the probability of note occurrence. Similarity is then measured between the melody features of humming and music data using DP matching method.

A multiple-pitch detection algorithm for polyphonic signals is used to calculate Pitch Histograms for audio signals. In order to evaluate the extent and significance of errors resulting from the automatic multiple-pitch detection, automatic musical genre classification results from symbolic and audio data are compared.

During analysis, the music signals are first represented in terms of accentuation on four frequency subbands, and then the accent signals are transformed into periodicity domain. Beat and tatum periods and phases are estimated in a probabilistic setting, incorporating primitive musicological knowledge of beat–tatum relations, the prior distributions, and the temporal continuities of beats and tatums.

The framework of the model naturally quantifies these three musical concepts in terms of hidden state-variables, allowing resolution of otherwise apparent ambiguities in musical structure. At the heart of the system is a probabilistic model of a hypothetical ‘bar-pointer’ which maps an input signal to one cycle of a latent, periodic rhythmical pattern.

Musicians annotate at the note (rather than at the phrase or movement) level, their annotations are standardized and formal, and are largely non-text.

The key space is modelled by a 24-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM), where each state represents one of the 24 major and minor keys, and each observation represents a chord transition, or pair of consecutive chords. The use of chord transitions as the observations models a greater temporal dependency between consecutive chords than would observations of single chords. The key transition and chord emission probabilities are initialised using the results of perceptual tests in order to reflect the human expectation of harmonic relationships. HMM parameters are then trained on a per-song basis using hand-annotated chord symbols, before the model for each song is decoded to give the likelihood of each key at each time frame. Examples of the algorithm as a segmentation technique are given, and its capability to estimate the overall key of a song is evaluated using a data set of 110 Beatles songs, of which 91% were correctly classified. An extension to include operation from audio data instead of chord symbols is planned, which will enable application to general music retrieval purposes.",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[-19.239178, 5.9967046]","[-2.6613643, -25.847385]","[-8.4593935, -5.3546915, 7.135574]","[-10.301207, 12.100675, -3.1935124]","[9.909902, 8.10773]","[11.108078, 3.588622]","[10.446855, 14.220232, 0.18902482]","[8.951252, 3.907692, -1.350523]"

Okuno+Kyoto University>JPN>education,"This paper presents a hybrid music recommendation method that solves problems of two prominent conventional methods: collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. The former cannot recommend musical pieces that have no ratings because recommendations are based on actual user ratings. In addition, artist variety in recommended pieces tends to be poor. The latter, which recommends musical pieces that are similar to users’ favorites in terms of music content, has not been fully investigated. This induces unreliability in modeling of user preferences; the content similarity does not completely reflect the preferences. Our method integrates both rating and content data by using a Bayesian network called an aspect model. Unobservable user preferences are directly represented by introducing latent variables, which are statistically estimated. To verify our method, we conducted experiments by using actual audio signals of Japanese songs and the corresponding rating data collected from Amazon. The results showed that our method outperforms the two conventional methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and artist variety and can reasonably recommend pieces even if they have no ratings.",JPN,education,Developed economies,"[45.22085, 26.976229]","[43.66607, 24.73814]","[28.623775, 18.8351, 2.4371388]","[16.931847, 7.5860624, 18.354074]","[15.079683, 9.907288]","[4.4323587, 3.5877502]","[12.776012, 18.035158, 1.9875613]","[3.9322186, 2.848393, -0.72408885]"

Using previous music players with normal headphones, we can hear only one song at a time and we thus have to play pieces individually to select the one we want to hear from numerous new music files, which involves a large number of mouse operations. The main advantage of our headphones is that they detect natural movements, such as the head or hand moving when users are listening to music and they can focus on a particular musical source that they want to hear. By moving their head left or right, listeners can hear the source from a frontal position as the digital compass detects the change in the direction they are facing. By looking up or down, the tilt sensor will detect the change in the face’s angle of elevation; they can better hear the source that is allocated to a more distant or closer position.

This paper describes a method for tempo tracking which builds on current research in the field. In this algorithm, an autocorrelation surface is calculated from the output of a spectral energy flux onset novelty function. The most salient repetition rate is calculated by cross-correlating dilations of a comb-like prototype spanning multiple frames and the autocorrelation surface. The method addresses tempo tracking through time to account for pieces with variable tempos. In order to compare the performance of our method on music with strong and weak percussive onsets we have evaluated it on both classical music with and without percussion and popular music with percussion.

The unfortunate corollary to this result is that the classification results of these systems are based not entirely on the music itself, but on other audio features common to the album that may be unrelated to the underlying music. We hypothesize that one of the primary reasons for this phenomenon is the production process of commercial recordings, specifically, post-production.

It consists of a template based note detection front-end that seeks to detect notes without regard to musical duration, accidentals or the key signature. The presented method is designed for the commonly used grand staff and the approach is extendable to other types of scores. The image processing consists of page segmentation into lines followed by multiple stages that optimally orient the lines and establish a reference grid to be used in the note identification stage. Both the audio and the printed score are converted into compatible frequency representations. Alignment is performed using dynamic time warping with a specially designed distance measure. The insufficient pitch resolution due to the reductive nature of the mid-level representation is compensated by this pitch tolerant distance measure.

Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) has been recently employed to this problem producing very successful results. The method decomposes the signal into a low-rank component corresponding to the accompaniment with its repetitive structure, and a sparse component corresponding to the voice with its quasi-harmonic structure. In this paper we first introduce a non-negative variant of RPCA, termed as robust low-rank non-negative matrix factorization (RNMF). This new framework better suits audio applications. We then propose two efficient feed-forward architectures that approximate the RPCA and RNMF with low latency and a fraction of the complexity of the original optimization method. These approximants allow incorporating elements of unsupervised, semi- and fully-supervised learning into the RPCA and RNMF frameworks. Our basic implementation shows several orders of magnitude speedup compared to the exact solvers with no performance degradation, and allows online and faster-than-real-time processing.

Each harmonic sound is assumed to emit a large number of sound quanta over the time-log-frequency domain. The observation probability is expressed as the product of two Gaussian mixtures. The number of quanta is calculated in the ϵ-neighborhood of each grid point on the spectrogram. BNHTF integrates latent harmonic allocation (LHA) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to estimate both the observation probability and the number of quanta.

Approaches to the analysis of rhythm in music information retrieval to date have focussed on low-level features for retrieval or on the detection of tempo, beats and drums in audio recordings. Musicological approaches are usually concerned with the description or implementation of man-made music theories. In this paper, we present a quantitative bottom-up approach to the study of rhythm that relies upon well-understood statistical methods from natural language processing. We adapt these methods to our corpus of music, based on the realisation that—unlike words—bar-length drum patterns can be systematically decomposed into sub-patterns both in time and by instrument. We show that, in some respects, our rhythm corpus behaves like natural language corpora, particularly in the sparsity of vocabulary. The same methods that detect word collocations allow us to quantify and rank idiomatic combinations of drum patterns. In other respects, our corpus has properties absent from language corpora, in particular, the high amount of repetition and strong mutual information rates between drum instruments. Our findings may be of direct interest to musicians and musicologists, and can inform the design of ground truth corpora and computational models of musical rhythm.",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[-10.279865, -25.9718]","[3.1417863, 2.867774]","[-0.25352535, -24.103855, -10.441172]","[-3.913041, -17.111044, 8.303772]","[9.351525, 6.2495217]","[8.59726, 2.2080326]","[11.81835, 12.151974, 1.5265001]","[8.1212225, 2.7743187, -0.05608678]"

Our findings suggest several trends in the types of music services people like: an increase in the popularity of music streaming and mobile music consumption, the emergence of new functionality, such as music identification and cloud music services, an appreciation of music videos, serendipitous discovery of music, and customizability, as well as users’ changing expectations of particular types of music information.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[31.20957, 26.347988]","[38.81706, 33.02205]","[22.572765, 11.166043, -12.096699]","[9.623901, 6.3194566, 27.418509]","[13.768038, 9.063343]","[3.8831086, 2.7773438]","[12.349389, 16.968422, 0.95296764]","[3.8414528, 2.388118, 0.3336675]"

Three types of audio features, namely the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, the chroma features, and the auditory temporal modulations are employed in order to form beat-synchronous feature sequences modeling the audio signal. Assume that the feature vectors from each segment lie in a subspace and the song as a whole occupies the union of several subspaces. Then any feature vector can be represented as a linear combination of the feature vectors stemming from the same subspace. The coefficients of such a linear combination are found by solving an appropriate ridge regression problem, resulting to the ridge representation (RR) of the audio features. The RR yields an affinity matrix with nonzero within-subspace affinities and zero between-subspace ones, revealing the structure of the music recording. The segmentation of the feature sequence into music segments is found by applying the normalized cuts algorithm to the RR-based affinity matrix. In the same context, the combination of multiple audio features is investigated as well. The proposed method is referred to as ridge regression-based music structure analysis (RRMSA).

Target tempi range is divided into overlapping “tempo bands” and the periodicity function is filtered by triangular masks aligned to those tempo bands, in order to calculate the respective saliencies, followed by the application of the DCT transform on band strengths. The second contribution is the adoption of Support Vector Machines to learn broad tempo classes from the coded periodicity vectors. Training instances are assigned a tempo class according to annotated tempo. The classes are assumed to correspond to “music speed”. At classification phase, each target excerpt is assigned a tempo class label by the SVM. Target periodicity vector is masked by the predicted tempo class range, and tempo is estimated by peak picking in the reduced periodicity vector.

Automatic music transcription involves several subproblems that are interdependent of each other: multiple fundamental frequency estimation, onset detection, and rhythm/tempo recognition. In general, simultaneous estimation is preferable when several estimation problems have chicken-and-egg relationships. This paper proposes modeling the generative process of an entire music spectrogram by combining the sub-process by which a musically natural tempo curve is generated, the sub-process by which a set of note onset positions is generated based on a 2-dimensional tree structure representation of music, and the sub-process by which a music spectrogram is generated according to the tempo curve and the note onset positions. Most conventional approaches to music transcription perform note extraction prior to structure analysis, but accurate note extraction has been a difficult task.

This particularly holds true for tempo-related properties, which may vary significantly across different performances of the same piece of music. In this paper, we show that tempo-based novelty detection can be stabilized and improved by simultaneously analyzing a set of different performances. We first warp the version-dependent novelty curves onto a common musical time axis, and then combine the individual curves to produce a single fusion curve. Our hypothesis is that musically relevant points of novelty tend to be consistent across different performances.

To find such parts in audio recordings of folk songs, segmentation methods can be used that split a recording into separate parts according to different criteria. Most audio segmentation methods were developed for popular and classical music, however these do not perform well on folk music recordings. This is mainly because folk song recordings contain a number of specific issues that are not considered by these methods, such as inaccurate singing of performers, variable tempo throughout the song and the presence of noise. In recent years several methods for segmentation of folk songs were developed. In this paper we present a novel method for segmentation of folk songs into repeating stanzas that does not rely on additional information about an individual stanza. The method consists of several steps. In the first step breathing (vocal) pauses are detected, which represent the candidate beginnings of individual stanzas. Next, a similarity measure is calculated between the first and all other candidate stanzas, which takes into account pitch changes between stanzas and tempo variations. To evaluate which candidate beginnings represent the actual boundaries between stanzas, a scoring function is defined based on the calculated similarities between stanzas. A peak picking method is used in combination with global thresholding for the final selection of stanza boundaries. The presented method was tested and evaluated on a collection of Slovenian folk songs from EthnoMuse archive.",SVN,education,Developed economies,"[16.776463, -10.521536]","[-6.8059134, -20.378267]","[-6.537313, 15.980227, -10.848691]","[-4.3987293, -0.564009, -3.5812433]","[10.727032, 11.094314]","[9.416442, 3.0959933]","[10.552083, 15.722965, 2.5988936]","[7.8886504, 3.6706252, -0.9972568]"

We propose an algorithm to retrieve episodes in the fugues of the first book of Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavier, starting from a symbolic score which is already track-separated. The algorithm does not use any information on subject or counter-subject occurrences, but tries to detect partial harmonic sequences, that is similar pitch contour in at least two voices. For this, it uses a substitution function considering “quantized partially overlapping intervals” [14] and a strict length matching for all notes, except for the first and the last one.

However, whilst this minimises the effect such timing deviations have on the local tempo estimate, it also obscures the expressive timing devices used by the performer.

We follow this approach, but use the level-dependent auditory spectrum, evaluated using the loudness models of Glasberg and Moore, at three listening levels, to produce auditory spectrum cepstral coefficients (ASCCs). The ASCCs are used to generate sets of playlists at each listening level, using a typical method, and these playlists were found to differ greatly.

By using novel time-frequency analysis techniques that improve the location of the components of a harmonic sound, the melodic content representation implemented here allows a detailed study of aspects related to pitch intonation and tuning.

Seed determination is a key issue for the accuracy of the method and closely depends on the database, the representation and the application. We introduce a particular seeding approach for cover detection, and evaluate it on both a 2000-piece training set and the million song dataset (MSD). We show that the heuristic alignment drastically improves time computation for cover song detection. Alignment sensitivity is still very high on the small database, but is dramatically weakened on the MSD, due to differences in chroma features. We discuss the impact of different choices of these features on alignment of musical pieces.",FRA,education,Developed economies,"[-24.662476, 27.126583]","[24.271753, -23.562037]","[9.388962, -18.88181, 9.569823]","[14.098711, -18.499104, 1.6553711]","[10.7021885, 6.638619]","[8.092523, 1.2904558]","[11.487321, 13.838229, -0.64026296]","[7.384062, 1.8561493, -1.1135471]"

This paper reports on a study comparing mood judgments on a set of 30 songs by American and Chinese people. Results show that mood judgments do indeed differ between American and Chinese respondents. Furthermore, respondents’ mood judgments tended to agree more with other respondents from the same culture than those from the other group. Both the song characteristics (e.g., genre, lyrical or instrumental) and the non-cultural background of the respondents (e.g., age, gender, familiarity with the songs) were analyzed to further examine the difference in mood judgments.

To tackle tag-model estimation, we propose an efficient hierarchical EM algorithm for ARMs (HEM-ARM), which summarizes the acoustic information common to the ARMs modeling the individual songs associated with a tag. We compare the ARM model with the recently proposed dynamic texture mixture (DTM) model. We hence investigate the relative merits of different modeling choices for music time-series: i) the flexibility of selecting higher memory order in ARM, ii) the capability of DTM to learn specific frequency basis for each particular tag and iii) the effect of the hidden layer of the DT versus the time efficiency of learning and inference with fully observable AR components.

We integrate both approaches with an automatic transcription system, which first estimates the tuning frequency and then implements an iterative strategy for note segmentation and labeling. We evaluate them on a flamenco music collection, including a wide range of singers and recording conditions. Both strategies achieve satisfying results. The separation-based approach yields a good overall accuracy (76.81%), although instrumental segments have to be manually located.

In a traditional supervised machine learning setting, a system can only use labeled data from a single dataset to solve a given task. The labels associated with the dataset define the nature of the task to solve. A key advantage of transfer learning is in leveraging knowledge from related tasks to improve performance on a given target task. One way to transfer knowledge is to learn a shared latent representation across related tasks. This method has shown to be beneficial in many domains of machine learning, but has yet to be explored in MIR. Many MIR datasets for audio classification present a semantic overlap in their labels. Furthermore, these datasets often contain relatively few songs.

In doing so, we also propose an efficient way of representing this additional information that takes advantage of the RBM’s structure. In our evaluation, this RBM-based prediction model performs slightly better than previously evaluated n-gram models in most cases.

However, in necessarily supervised problems such as music emotion recognition, there is no guarantee that the starting points for optimization are anywhere near optimal, as emotion is unlikely to be the most dominant aspect of the data. In this new work, we develop input representations using harmonic/percussive source separation designed to inform rhythm and melodic contour. These representations are beat synchronous, providing an event-driven representation, and potentially the ability to learn emotion informative representations from pre-training alone.

Indian classical music has a definite hierarchical structure where macro level concepts like thaats and raga are defined in terms of micro entities like swaras and shrutis. Swaras or notes in Indian music are defined only in terms of their relation to one another (akin to the movable do-re-mi-fa system), and an inference must be made from patterns of sounds, rather than their absolute frequency structure. We have developed methods to perform scale-independent raga identification using a random forest classifier on swara histograms and achieved state-of-the-art results for the same. The approach is robust as it directly works on partly noisy raga recordings from Youtube videos without knowledge of the scale used, whereas previous work in this direction often use audios generated in a controlled environment with the desired scale.

Many music/voice separation techniques tend to focus on modeling one source; the residual is then used to explain the other source. In such cases, separation performance is often unsatisfactory for the source that has not been explicitly modeled. In this work, we propose to combine a method that explicitly models singing voice with a method that explicitly models background music, to address separation performance from the point of view of both sources. One method learns a singer-independent model of voice from singing examples using a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) based technique, while the other method derives a model of music by identifying and extracting repeating patterns using a similarity matrix and a median filter. Since the model of voice is singer-independent and the model of music does not require training data, the proposed method does not require training data from a user, once deployed. Evaluation on a data set of 1,000 song clips showed that combining modeling of both sources can improve separation performance, when compared with modeling only one of the sources, and also compared with two other state-of-the-art methods.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-8.577044, -41.004467]","[-46.429745, -25.810379]","[-19.390059, -19.67414, 9.541642]","[-11.222279, -10.946475, -31.887182]","[7.6409087, 11.103298]","[10.742614, 5.266436]","[8.309632, 14.27766, -0.020216879]","[8.841099, 5.916882, 0.13848898]"

In spite of this, no standard software for the degradation of audio exists, and music processing methods are usually evaluated against clean data. The ADT fills this gap by providing Matlab scripts that emulate a wide range of degradation types. We describe 14 degradation units, and how they can be chained to create more complex, ‘real-world’ degradations. The ADT also provides functionality to adjust existing ground-truth, correcting for temporal distortions introduced by degradation.

Among these representations, self-similarity matrices have become common representations for visualizing the time structure of an audio signal. In the context of organizing recordings, recent work has shown that, given a collection of recordings, it is possible to group performances of the same musical work based on the pairwise similarity between structural representations of the audio signal.

One promising class of methods to accomplish this task is based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Such methods, however, are still far from perfect. Distinct pitches from a single instrument have similar timbre, similar note attacks, and contain overlapping harmonics that all make separation difficult. In an attempt to overcome these issues, we use a database of synthesized piano and guitar recordings to learn the harmonic structure of distinct pitches, perform NMF-based separation, and then extend the method to allow an end-user to interactively correct for errors in the output separation estimates by drawing on a piano roll display of the separated tracks. The user-annotations are mapped to linear grouping regularization parameters within a modified NMF-based algorithm and are then used to refine the separation estimates in an iterative manner. For evaluation, a prototype user-interface was built and used to separate several polyphonic guitar and piano recordings.

A good illustrative genre is flamenco, which employs not only regular but also irregular hypermetrical structures that rapidly switch between 3/4 and 6/8 mediocompas blocks. Moreover, typical flamenco idioms employ heavy syncopation and sudden, misleading off-beat accents and patterns, while often elliding the downbeat accents that humans as well as existing meter-finding algorithms rely on, thus creating a high degree of listener “surprise” that makes not only the structural relations, but even the metrical structure itself, elusive to learn. Flamenco musicians rely on both complex regular hypermetrical knowledge as well as irregular real-time clues to recognize when to switch meters and patterns. Our new approach envisions this as an integrated problem of learning a bilingual transduction, i.e., a structural relation between two languages—where there are different musical languages of, say, flamenco percussion versus zapateado footwork or palmas hand clapping. We apply minimum description length criteria to induce transduction grammars that simultaneously learn (1) the multiple metrical structures, (2) the hypermetrical structure that stochastically governs meter switching, and (3) the probabilistic transduction relationship between patterns of different rhythmic languages that enables musicians to predict when to switch meters and how to select patterns depending on what fellow musicians are generating.",HKG,education,Developing economies,"[11.109759, -16.200254]","[-21.174887, -13.71379]","[-3.4680045, -4.48908, -14.647401]","[-12.202181, -23.54851, -0.43149647]","[10.269463, 10.639743]","[10.450377, 2.1325388]","[9.794798, 15.597076, 1.9019773]","[8.6468315, 3.4268274, 1.1862355]"

In this paper, we present two methodologies for the identification of the tonic in audio recordings of makam music of Turkey, both taking advantage of some score information. First, we compute a prominent pitch and a audio kernel-density pitch class distribution (KPCD) from the audio recording. The peaks in the KPCD are selected as tonic candidates. The first method computes a score KPCD from the monophonic melody extracted from the score. Then, the audio KPCD is circular-shifted with respect to each tonic candidate and compared with the score KPCD. The best matching shift indicates the estimated tonic. The second method extracts the monophonic melody of the most repetitive section of the score. Normalising the audio prominent pitch with respect to each tonic candidate, the method attempts to link the repetitive structural element given in the score with the respective time-intervals in the audio recording. The result producing the most confident links marks the estimated tonic. We have tested the methods on a dataset of makam music of Turkey, achieving a very high accuracy (94.9%) with the first method, and almost perfect identification (99.6%) with the second method.

It often involves judgements and opinions from people of different background and level of musical expertise. Therefore, the resulting tags are usually subjective, ambiguous, and error-prone. To deal with this situation, we seek automatic methods to verify and monitor this process. Furthermore, because multiple tags can annotate each music piece, our task lends itself to multi-label methods which capture the inherent associations among annotations in a given music repository.

We evaluate this method by comparing it to a system that infers the mood of a given track using associated tags only. SLP differs from conventional auto-tagging algorithms in that it maps audio features to a low-dimensional semantic layer congruent with the circumplex model of emotion, rather than training a model for each tag separately. We build the semantic layer using two large-scale data sets – crowd-sourced tags from Last.fm, and editorial annotations from the I Like Music (ILM) production music corpus – and use subsets of these corpora to train SLP for mapping audio features to the semantic layer. The performance of the system is assessed in predicting mood ratings on continuous scales in the two data sets mentioned above.

This data is used to populate an artist-station index that is similar to the term-document matrix of a traditional text-based information retrieval system. When a user wants to find stations for a given seed artist, we check the index to determine a set of stations that are either currently playing or have recently played that artist. These stations are grouped into three clusters and one representative station is selected from each cluster. This promotes diversity among the stations that are returned to the user.

On one side, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning allow to benefit from the availability of larger sets of training data, even if not fully annotated with class labels, and of larger sets of diverse feature representations, through novel dimensionality reduction schemes. On the other side, ensemble methods allow to benefit from more diversity in base learners though larger data and feature sets. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble learning approach making use of recent non-linear dimensionality reduction methods. More precisely, we apply t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to a large feature set to come up with embeddings of various dimensionality. A k-NN classifier is then obtained for each embedding, leading to an ensemble whose estimates can then be combined, making use of various ensemble combination rules from the literature. The rationale of this approach resides in its potential capacity to better handle manifolds of different dimensionality in different regions of the feature space. We evaluate the approach on a transductive audio classification task, where only part of the whole data set is labeled. We confirm that dimensionality reduction by itself can improve performance (by 40% relative), and that creating an ensemble through the proposed approach further reduces classification error rate by about 10% relative.",BEL,education,Developed economies,"[25.031364, -13.383516]","[3.4585683, 24.764233]","[-6.0423393, 20.883812, 8.022522]","[22.197302, 9.1754265, -3.0886717]","[11.585172, 11.135591]","[6.9798317, 4.205143]","[11.715141, 14.394969, 2.7959092]","[6.3345213, 4.4973307, -0.12828611]"

The study focuses on the relevance of gestural (e.g. visual, breath) cues in achieving note onset synchrony in a violin and cello duo, in which musicians must fulfill a mutual conducting role. The musicians performed two pieces – one with long notes separated by long pauses, another with long notes but no pauses – under direct, partial (silhouettes), and no line of sight. Analysis of the musicians’ note synchrony shows that visual contact significantly impacts synchronization in the first piece, but not significantly in the second piece, leading to the hypothesis that opportunities to shape notes may provide further cues for synchronization. The results also show that breath cues are important, and that the relative positions of these cues impact note asynchrony at the ends of pauses; thus, the advance timing information provided by breath cues could form a basis for generating virtual cues in distributed performance, where network latency delays sonic and visual cues. This study demonstrates the need to account for structure (e.g. pauses, long notes) and prosodic gestures in ensemble synchronisation.",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[-32.639645, 19.939156]","[-12.802004, -18.00756]","[5.6059113, -22.363642, 0.809013]","[-6.9365654, -13.502097, 0.6835826]","[10.124262, 6.2888865]","[10.304277, 1.4080652]","[12.043011, 13.130908, -0.05541696]","[9.287236, 2.6485229, 0.99501795]"

Although non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has recently become very popular for music source separation, it deals only with the amplitude or power of the spectrogram of a given mixture signal and completely discards the phase. The component spectrograms are typically estimated using a Wiener filter that reuses the phase of the mixture spectrogram, but such rough phase reconstruction makes it hard to recover high-quality source signals because the estimated spectrograms are inconsistent, i.e., they do not correspond to any real time-domain signals. To avoid the frequency-domain phase reconstruction, we use positive semidefinite tensor factorization (PSDTF) for directly estimating source signals from the mixture signal in the time domain. Since PSDTF is a natural extension of NMF, an efficient multiplicative update algorithm for PSDTF can be derived.

We derive a novel mean-field variational inference algorithm for this nonconjugate model and evaluate it on both synthetic data and real recordings on various tasks.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-2.6431773, 7.1598115]","[-44.391922, -27.066803]","[-4.4576187, -3.7317014, 9.703285]","[-9.234033, -13.997268, -34.09282]","[9.861268, 8.828024]","[10.892969, 5.163367]","[10.258919, 14.117245, 0.7187688]","[8.928101, 5.8463483, -0.08506299]"

But in many cases individual source audio is not available for training. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel scheme using semi-supervised PLCA with probabilistic graph clustering, which does not require individual sources for training. The PLCA is based on source-filter approach which models the spectral envelope as a weighted sum of elementary band-pass filters. The novel graph based approach, embedded in the PLCA framework, takes into account various perceptual cues for characterizing a source. These cues include temporal cues like the evolution of F0 contours as well as the acoustic cues like mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. The proposed scheme shows better results in identifying vocal sources than a state of the art unsupervised scheme. In addition, the proposed framework can be used to incorporate perceptual cues so as to enhance the performance of supervised schemes too.",IND,education,Developing economies,"[-24.740923, -19.60557]","[-39.466698, -23.99754]","[-8.988546, -12.315219, 18.063026]","[-5.7944, -9.836322, -37.986732]","[8.302862, 7.818099]","[10.4112215, 4.6586404]","[10.124738, 13.823276, 0.05779099]","[8.544391, 5.4331045, -0.121242195]"

Though music emotion recognition has received a lot of attention, researchers have only recently begun considering the relationship between emotion and timbre. To this end, we devised a listening test to compare representative tones from eight different wind and string instruments. The goal was to determine if some tones were consistently perceived as being happier or sadder in pairwise comparisons. A total of eight emotions were tested in the study. The results showed strong underlying emotional characters for each instrument. The emotions Happy, Joyful, Heroic, and Comic were strongly correlated with one another. The violin, trumpet, and clarinet best represented these emotions. Sad and Depressed were also strongly correlated. These two emotions were best represented by the horn and flute. Scary was the emotional outlier of the group, while the oboe had the most emotionally neutral timbre.

Based on this observation, one can separate singing voice from the background music. However, the quality of such separation might be limited, because the vocal part of a song can sometimes be low-rank as well. Therefore, we propose to learn the subspace structures of vocal and instrumental sounds from a collection of clean signals first, and then compute the low-rank representations of both the vocal and instrumental parts of a song based on the learned subspaces. Specifically, we use online dictionary learning to learn the subspaces, and propose a new algorithm called multiple low-rank representation (MLRR) to decompose a magnitude spectrogram into two low-rank matrices. Our approach is flexible in that the subspaces of singing voice and music accompaniment are both learned from data. Evaluation on the MIR-1K dataset shows that the approach improves the source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) and the source-to-interference ratio (SIR), but not the source-to-artifact ratio (SAR).",TWN,facility,Developing economies,"[-0.16124424, -45.862072]","[-48.168087, -28.671328]","[-17.20263, -19.287947, -21.13251]","[-12.610859, -13.079163, -33.52276]","[8.765723, 11.782402]","[10.750467, 5.129491]","[8.751324, 15.370874, 0.6458625]","[8.843164, 5.793341, -0.01803385]"

We use the results of the 2012 MIREX Structural Segmentation task, which was accompanied by anonymous ground truth, to conduct a meta-evaluation of the algorithms. We hope this demonstrates the benefits, to both the participants and evaluators of MIREX, of releasing more data in evaluation tasks.

Our aim is to learn more about the performance of the algorithms by studying how their success relates to properties of the annotations and recordings. We find that some evaluation metrics are redundant, and that several algorithms do not adequately model the true number of segments in typical annotations.

Despite their successes, these methods only guarantee that the decomposition converges to a local minimum in the cost function. In order to find better local minima, we propose to extend an existing PLCA-based transcription method with the deterministic annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm. The PLCA update rules are modified by introducing a “temperature” parameter. At higher temperatures, general areas of the search space containing good solutions are found. As the temperature is gradually decreased, distinctions in the data are sharpened, resulting in a more fine-grained optimisation at each successive temperature. This process reduces the dependence on the initialisation, which is otherwise a limitation of NMF and PLCA approaches. The method was tested on two standard multi-instrument transcription data sets (MIREX and Bach10). Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art reference method, according to both frame-based and note-based metrics.

A property of an item in carnatic music, is that within every item, a small portion of the audio corresponds to the rendering of a composition which is rendered by the entire ensemble of lead performer and accompanying instruments. A concert is divided into segments using applauses and the location of the ensemble in every item is first obtained using Cent Filterbank Cepstral Coefficients (CFCC) combined with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Since constituent parts of an item are rendered in a single raga, raga information is used to merge adjacent segments belonging to the same item. Inter-item applauses are used to locate the end of an item in a concert. The results are evaluated for fifty live recordings with 990 applauses in total.

In this paper, an attempt is made to spot typical melodic motifs of a raga queried in a musical piece using a two pass dynamic programming approach, with pitch as the basic feature. In the first pass, the rough longest common subsequence (RLCS) matching is performed between the saddle points of the pitch contours of the reference motif and the musical piece. These saddle points corresponding to quasi-stationary points of the motifs, are relevant entities of the raga. Multiple sequences are identified in this step, not all of which correspond to the motif that is queried. To reduce the false alarms, in the second pass a fine search using RLCS is performed between the continuous pitch contours of the reference motif and the subsequences obtained in the first pass.

Since manual annotation of PAT for analysis is both time-consuming and impractical for real-time applications, automatic transcription is desirable. However, computational methods for onset detection in audio signals are conventionally measured against PhOT or POT data. This paper describes a comparison between PAT and onset detection data to assess whether in some circumstances they are similar enough to be equivalent, or whether additional models for PAT-PhOT difference are always necessary. Eight published onset algorithms, and one commercial system, were tested with five onset types in short monophonic sequences. Ground truth was established by multiple human transcription of the audio for PATs using rhythm adjustment with synchronous presentation, and parameters for each detection algorithm manually adjusted to produce the maximum agreement with the ground truth. Results indicate that for percussive attacks, a number of algorithms produce data close to or within the limits of human agreement and therefore may be substituted for PATs, while for non-percussive sounds corrective measures are necessary to match detector outputs to human estimates.",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[-43.686516, -10.097801]","[-17.623747, -28.772852]","[-6.9994383, -22.13729, -2.5930588]","[6.0165668, -13.703222, -8.677555]","[8.565897, 5.933115]","[10.877968, 2.3742156]","[11.316467, 11.697717, -0.035347037]","[9.854592, 3.7981734, 0.7209568]"

First, rather than using fixed rules, we use a model that learns from data: a neural network that predicts voice assignments for notes. Second, our method is specifically designed for tablature—tablature information is included in the features used as input for the models—but it can also be applied to other music corpora. We have experimented on a dataset containing tablature pieces of different polyphonic textures, and compare the results against those obtained from a baseline hidden Markov model (HMM) model. Additionally, we have performed a preliminary comparison of the neural network model with several existing methods for voice separation on a small dataset. We have found that the neural network model performs clearly better than the baseline model, and competitively with the existing methods.",GBR,education,Developed economies,"[-9.393997, -44.572834]","[-46.144604, -11.79508]","[-17.525251, -26.48465, 9.273422]","[-12.958969, 3.3286989, -26.949577]","[7.565228, 11.153864]","[9.852735, 5.399607]","[8.192897, 14.342313, 0.058290932]","[8.590288, 5.3232465, 1.0329988]"

Given a user-specified input song, the system first identifies the phrase-level structure and then estimates the “mashability” between each phrase section of the input and songs in the user’s music collection. Mashability is calculated based on the harmonic similarity between beat synchronous chromagrams over a user-definable range of allowable key shifts and tempi. Once a match in the collection for a given section of the input song has been found, a pitch-shifting and time-stretching algorithm is used to harmonically and temporally align the sections, after which the loudness of the transformed section is modified to ensure a balanced mix. AutoMashUpper has a user interface to allow visualisation and manipulation of mashups. When creating a mashup, users can specify a list of songs to choose from, modify the mashability parameters and change the granularity of the phrase segmentation. Once created, users can also switch, add, or remove sections from the mashup to suit their taste.

Typically, the first movements of symphonies and sonatas follow the sonata form, which (in its most basic form) starts with an exposition and a repetition thereof, continues with a development, and closes with a recapitulation. The recapitulation can be regarded as an altered repeat of the exposition, where certain substructures (first and second subject groups) appear in musically modified forms. In this paper, we introduce automated methods for analyzing music recordings in sonata form, where we proceed in two steps. In the first step, we derive the coarse structure by exploiting that the recapitulation is a kind of repetition of the exposition. This requires audio structure analysis tools that are invariant under local modulations. In the second step, we identify finer substructures by capturing relative modulations between the subject groups in exposition and recapitulation.

Both approaches are integrated into a probabilistic system that jointly estimates keys, chords and structural boundaries. The novelty curves are herein used as observations.

The most common alignment method, dynamic time warping (DTW), cannot handle structural differences adequately, and existing approaches to deal with structural differences explicitly rely on the annotation of “break points” in one of the sequences. We propose a simple extension of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to deal effectively with structural differences, without relying on annotations. We evaluate several audio features for alignment, and show how an optimal value can be found for the cost-parameter of the alignment algorithm. A single cost value is demonstrated to be valid across different types of music.

Many MIR tasks require information about musical structure, or would perform better if such information were available. Automatic derivation of musical structure faces two significant obstacles. Firstly, the solution space of possible structural analyses of a piece is very large. Secondly, pieces can have more than one valid structural analysis, and there is little firm agreement among music theorists about how to distinguish a good analysis. To circumvent the first of these obstacles, software has been developed which derives a tractable ‘matrix’ of possibilities from a musical surface (i.e., MIDI-like note-time information). The matrix is somewhat like the intermediate results of a dynamic-programming algorithm, and in a similar way it is possible to extract a particular structural analysis from the matrix by following the appropriate path from the top level to the surface.

Mood as a music access feature, however, is not well understood in that the terms used to describe it are not standardized and their application can be highly idiosyncratic. To better understand how we might develop methods for comprehensively developing and formally evaluating useful automated mood access techniques, we explore the relationships that mood has with genre, artist and usage metadata. Statistical analyses of term interactions across three metadata collections (AllMusicGuide.com, epinions.com and Last.fm) reveal important consistencies within the genre-mood and artist-mood relationships.

However, incorporating hierarchical structure into conventional machine learning systems presents a challenge: the use of independent binary classifiers for each class in the hierarchy can produce hierarchically inconsistent predictions. That is, an example may be assigned to a class, and not assigned to the parent of that class. This paper applies a Bayesian framework to combine, or aggregate, a hierarchy of multiple binary classifiers in a principled manner, and consequently improves performance over the hierarchy as a whole. Furthermore, such an approach allows for an arbitrarily complex hierarchy, and does not suffer from classes that are too broad or too refined. Experiments on the MIREX 2005 symbolic genre classification dataset show that our Bayesian Aggregation algorithm provides significant improvement over independent classifiers, and demonstrates superior performance compared to previous work.

In other words, the entire model needs to be re-trained from scratch whenever a new score, user, or piece is added.

To improve efficiency, we propose an incremental method that partially updates the model at low computational cost.

This paper offers an overview of the set of features, related, among others, to timbre, tonality, rhythm or form, that can be extracted with the MIRtoolbox. One particular analysis is provided as an example. The toolbox also includes functions for statistical analysis, segmentation and clustering. Particular attention has been paid to the design of a syntax that offers both simplicity of use and transparent adaptiveness to a multiplicity of possible input types. Each feature extraction method can accept as argument an audio file, or any preliminary result from intermediary stages of the chain of operations.

Thus, large amounts of training data can be generated quickly, but it is limited by the accuracy of the alignment, which in turn is ultimately related to the problem of onset detection.

The results for the tuning frequency estimation look very good for audio pieces where the dominant voices are tuned close to the equal-temperament scale and exhibit only moderate frequency dynamics. For the analysis of popular western music, the method does not achieve very robust results due to the strong frequency dynamics of the human singing voice. Nevertheless, the method could be improved by excluding the singing voice from the calculation taking only the accompaniment into account.

The basic approach is to derive from the pitches of the known variants per onset a weighted pitch distribution, which quantifies pitch stability. We allow for partial matching and AND and OR queries. Technically we do so by defining a distance measure between weighted pitch distribution sequences. It is based on two applications of the Earth Mover’s Distance, which is a distribution distance. We set up a distance framework and discuss musically meaningful parameterizations for two tasks: a) Study the inner-group distances between the group as a whole and single members of the group. b) Use the group’s weighted pitch distribution sequence to query for variant melodies.

However, current community-based web sites provide richer descriptors (i.e. tags) for all kinds of products. Although tags have no well-defined semantics, they have proven to be an effective mechanism to label and retrieve items. Moreover, these tags are community-based and hence give a description of a product through the eyes of a community rather than an expert opinion. In this work we focus on Last.fm, which is currently the largest music community web service. We investigate whether the tagging of artists is consistent with the artist similarities found with collaborative filtering techniques.

Secondly, we consider its simple refinement by adding a minimum amount of genre metadata. We compare the proposed approaches with one content-based and three metadata-based baselines. As such, we consider content-based approach working on inferred semantic descriptors, a tag-based recommender exploiting artist tags, a commercial black-box recommender partially employing collaborative filtering information, and a simple genre-based random recommender. We conduct a listening experiment with 19 participants. The obtained results reveal that although the low-level/semantic content-based approach does not achieve the performance of the baseline working exclusively on the inferred semantic descriptors, the proposed refinement provides significant improvement in the listeners’ satisfaction comparable with metadata-based approaches, and surpasses these approaches by the number of novel relevant recommendations.

In particular, the supervised type of NMF is garnering much attention in source separation with respect to the analysis accuracy and speed. In this approach, a large number of spectral samples is used for analyzing a signal. If the system has a minimal number of samples, the accuracy deteriorates. Because such methods require all the possible samples for the analysis, it is hard to build a practical analysis system. To analyze signals properly even when short of samples, we propose a novel method that combines a supervised NMF and probabilistic search algorithms. In this approach, it is assumed that each instrumental category has a model-invariant feature called a probabilistic spectrum envelope (PSE). The algorithm starts with learning the PSEs of each category using a technique based on Gaussian Process Regression. Using the PSEs for spectrum generation, an observed spectrum is analyzed under the framework of a supervised NMF.

This phenomenon is most striking in syncopated rhythms, found in many genres of music, including music of non-Western cultures. In general, syncopated rhythms may have energy at frequencies that do not correspond to perceived pulse or meter, and perceived metrical frequencies that are weak or absent in the objective rhythmic stimulus. In this paper, we consider syncopated rhythms that contain little or no energy at the pulse frequency. We used 16 rhythms (3 simple, 13 syncopated) to test a model of pulse/meter perception based on nonlinear resonance, comparing the nonlinear resonance model with a linear analysis. Both models displayed the ability to differentiate between duple and triple meters, however, only the nonlinear model exhibited resonance at the pulse frequency for the most challenging syncopated rhythms.

The spoken parts of broadcast recordings brought historical/extra-musical clues helping to understand music performance practices.

Automatic systems for music emotion recognition rely on ground truth data collected from humans, and more effective methods for collecting such data are being continuously developed. In previous work, we developed MoodSwings, an online collaborative game for crowdsourcing dynamic (per-second) mood ratings from multiple players within the two-dimensional arousal-valence (A-V) representation of emotion. MoodSwings has proven effective for data collection, but potential data effects caused by collaborative labeling have not yet been analyzed. In this work, we compare the effectiveness of MoodSwings to that of a more traditional data collection method, where annotation is performed by single, paid annotators. We implement a simplified labeling task to run on Amazon’s crowdsourcing engine, Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and analyze the labels collected with each method. A statistical comparison shows consistencies between MoodSwings and MTurk data, and we produce similar results using each as training data for automatic emotion production via supervised machine learning.

Robotic instruments that generate sound acoustically using actuators have been increasingly developed and used in performances and compositions over the past 10 years. Although such devices can be very sophisticated mechanically, in most cases they are passive devices that directly respond to control messages from a computer. In the few cases where more sophisticated control and feedback is employed it is in the form of simple mappings with little musical understanding. Several techniques for extracting musical information have been proposed in the field of music information retrieval. In most cases the focus has been the batch processing of large audio collections rather than real time performance understanding. In this paper we describe how such techniques can be adapted to deal with some of the practical problems we have experienced in our own work with music robotics. Of particular importance is the idea of self-awareness or proprioception in which the robot(s) adapt their behavior based on understanding the connection between their actions and sound generation through listening.

All possibilities of n are taken into account when calculating the predictive probability of a next chord given a particular context, and when an unseen chord type emerges we can avoid out-of-vocabulary error by adaptively evaluating the 0-gram probability, i.e., the combinatorial probability of note components.

Here, we used generic audio features, that can be calculated for any audio signal, and focused on the progression of these features through time, investigating how informative the dynamics of the audio is for emotional content. Our data is comprised of piano and vocal improvisations of musically trained performers, instructed to convey 4 categorical emotions. We applied Dynamic Texture Mixture (DTM), that models both the instantaneous sound qualities and their dynamics, and demonstrated the strength of the model.

In this work we seek to model such relationships using a conditional random field (CRF), a powerful graphical model which is trained to predict the conditional probability p(y|x) for a sequence of labels y given a sequence of features x.

We then test three hypotheses regarding differences in lyrics creativity between music with different moods on 2715 U.S. rock songs. The three measures led to consistent findings that lyrics of negative and sad songs demonstrate higher linguistic creativity than those of positive and happy songs.

First, the time-domain signal was segmented using complex-domain thresholding that looked for sudden changes in amplitude and phase discontinuities. At the optimal point on the ROC curve, false positives were less than 1% and false negatives were less than 2%. Then, classification was performed using a multivariate Gaussian model (mv gauss) as well as non-parametric techniques such as probabilistic neural networks (pnn), feed-forward neural networks (ffnn), and tree-based classifiers. Two evaluation protocols were used. The first used 10-fold cross validation.

STC decomposes the energy patterns diffused in time-frequency space, i.e., a time series of power spectrum, into distinct clusters such that each of them is originated from a single sound stream.

Next, note candidates are obtained by trajectory segmentation (in terms of frequency and pitch salience variations). Too short, low-salience and harmonically related notes are then eliminated. Finally, the notes comprising the melody are extracted. This is the main topic of this paper. We select the melody notes by making use of note saliences and melodic smoothness. First, we select the notes with highest pitch salience at each moment. Then, by the melodic smoothness principle, we exploit the fact that tonal melodies are usually smooth. Thus, long music intervals indicate the presence of possibly erroneous notes, which are substituted by notes that smooth out the melodic contour. Finally, false positives in the extracted melody should be eliminated. To this end, we remove spurious notes that correspond to abrupt drops in note saliences or durations.

Combinatorial redundancy inherent in the pattern discovery paradigm is usually ﬁltered using global selective mechanisms, based on pattern frequency and length. The proposed approach is founded instead on the concept of closed pattern, and insures lossless compression through an adaptive selection of most speciﬁc descriptions in the multi-dimensional parametric space. A notion of cyclic pattern is introduced, enabling the ﬁltering of another form of combinatorial redundancy provoked by successive repetitions of patterns. The use of cyclic patterns implies a necessary chronological scanning of the piece, and the addition of mechanisms formalising particular Gestalt principles. This study shows therefore that automated analysis of music cannot rely on simple mathematical or statistical approaches, but requires instead a complex and detailed modelling of the cognitive system ruling the listening processes. The resulting algorithm is able to offer for the ﬁrst time compact and relevant motivic analyses of monodies, and may therefore be applied to automated indexing of symbolic music databases.

Moreover, users often represent polyphonic pieces in their queries by skipping from one part (the soprano) to another (the bass).

For speed, algorithms generally depend on precalculated indexing metadata. Unfortunately, the size of the metadata follows the same exponential trend as the audio data itself, and this may lead to an exponential increase in storage cost and search time. The concept of scalable metadata has been introduced to allow metadata to adjust to such trends and alleviate the effects of foreseeable increases of data and metadata size. Here, we argue that scalability fits the needs of the hierarchical structures that allow fast search, and illustrate this by adapting a state-of-the-art search algorithm to a scalable indexing structure.

Errors in audio key finding, typically incorrect assignments of closely related keys, commonly result from imprecise pitch class determination and biases introduced by the quality of the sound. Our technique is motivated by hypotheses on the sources of audio key finding errors, and uses fuzzy analysis to reduce the errors caused by noisy detection of lower pitches, and to refine the biased raw frequency data, in order to extract more correct pitch classes. We compare the proposed system to two others, an earlier one employing only peak detection from FFT results, and another providing direct key finding from MIDI.

Because singing voices play an important role in musical pieces with a vocal part, the identification of singer names is useful for music information retrieval systems. The main problem in automatically identifying singers is the negative influences caused by accompaniment sounds. To solve this problem, we developed two methods, accompaniment sound reduction and reliable frame selection. The former method makes it possible to identify the singer of a singing voice after reducing accompaniment sounds. It first extracts harmonic components of the predominant melody from sound mixtures and then resynthesizes the melody by using a sinusoidal model driven by those components. The latter method then judges whether each frame of the obtained melody is reliable (i.e. little influenced by accompaniment sound) or not by using two Gaussian mixture models for vocal and non-vocal frames. It enables the singer identification using only reliable vocal portions of musical pieces. Experimental results with forty popular-music songs by ten singers showed that our method was able to reduce the influences of accompaniment sounds and achieved an accuracy of 95%, while the accuracy for a conventional method was 53%.",JPN,education,Developed economies,"[8.730329, -44.638092]","[-10.732831, 10.18308]","[-3.267108, -11.773423, -14.903171]","[10.798988, 7.816774, -16.774252]","[8.658883, 12.004556]","[9.18115, 4.3526473]","[8.765696, 15.380693, 0.4298708]","[8.011883, 5.280297, -0.012143077]"

Using the SyncPlayer client interface, a user may play back an audio recording that is locally available on his computer. The recording is then identified by the SyncPlayer server, a process which is performed entirely content-based. Subsequently, the server delivers music-related data like scores or lyrics to the client, which are then displayed synchronously with audio playback using a multimodal visualization plug-in. In addition to visualization, the system provides functionality for content-based music retrieval and semi-manual content annotation. To the best of our knowledge, our system is moreover the first to systematically exploit automatically generated synchronization data for content-based symbolic browsing in high quality audio recordings. SyncPlayer has already proved to be a valuable tool for evaluating algorithms in MIR research on a larger scale.

Traditionally, this analysis is done on paper scores, and most past research in machine-assisted analysis has begun with digital representations of them. Human music students are also taught to hear their musical analyses, however, in both musical recordings and performances. Our approach attempts to teach machines to do the same, beginning with a corpus of recorded Mozart symphonies. The audio files are first transformed into an ordered series of normalized pitch class profile (PCP) vectors. Simplified rules of tonal harmony are encoded in a transition matrix. Classical music tends to change key more frequently than popular music, and so these rules account not only for chords, as most previous work has done, but also for the keys in which they function. A hidden Markov model (HMM) is used with this transition matrix to train Dirichlet distributions for major and minor keys on the PCP vectors.

First we can use the matrix to enhance standard autocorrelation by calculating the Shannon entropy at each lag. This approach yields improved results for autocorrelation-based tempo induction. Second, we can efficiently search the matrix for combinations of lags that suggest particular metrical hierarchies. This approach yields a good model for predicting the meter of a piece of music. Finally we can use the phase information in the matrix to align a candidate meter with music, making it possible to perform beat induction with an autocorrelation-based model.

For each window in the input audio, the chroma based representation is interpreted with respect to the precalculated templates that serve as attractor points in tonal space. This leads to a discretization in both time and tonal space making the output representation compact. Local and global variations in tempo are accounted for using dynamic time warping that employs a special type of music theoretical distance measure. Evaluation is given in two stages.

Musical instrument identification (MII) is an important task in music information retrieval because MII results make it possible to automatically retrieve certain types of music (e.g., piano sonata, string quartet). Only a few studies, however, have dealt with MII in polyphonic music. In MII in polyphonic music, there are three issues: feature variations caused by sound mixtures, the pitch dependency of timbres, and the use of musical context. For the first issue, templates of feature vectors representing timbres are extracted from not only isolated sounds but also sound mixtures. Because some features are not robust in the mixtures, features are weighted according to their robustness by using linear discriminant analysis. For the second issue, we use an F0-dependent multivariate normal distribution, which approximates the pitch dependency as a function of fundamental frequency. For the third issue, when the instrument of each note is identified, the a priori probability of the note is calculated from the a posteriori probabilities of temporally neighboring notes. Experimental results showed that recognition rates were improved from 60.8% to 85.8% for trio music and from 65.5% to 91.1% for duo music.",JPN,education,Developed economies,"[-22.336205, -23.97025]","[-5.064169, 12.449077]","[-11.817677, -7.481536, 16.842985]","[7.7589226, 9.41217, -10.132762]","[8.114614, 7.853036]","[8.781972, 4.072364]","[10.014127, 13.276109, -0.2731948]","[7.9974527, 4.8299417, 0.089216776]"

The audio recordings may either contain a single instrument performing in solo mode, or an ensemble of instruments where one of the instruments has a leading role. The melody to be spotted is presented to the system as a sequence of note durations and music intervals. In the sequel, this sequence is treated as a pattern prototype and based on it, a VDHMM is constructed. The probabilities of the associated VDHMM are determined according to a set of rules that account (a) for the allowable note duration flexibility and (b) with possible structural deviations from the prototype pattern. In addition, for each raw audio recording in the database, a sequence of note durations and music intervals is extracted by means of a multi pitch tracking algorithm. These sequences are subsequently fed as input to the constructed VDHMM that models the pattern to be located. The VDHMM employs an enhanced Viterbi algorithm, previously introduced by the authors, in order to account for pitch tracking errors and performance improvisations of the instrument players. For each audio recording in the database, the best-state sequence generated by the enhanced Viterbi algorithm is further post-processed in order to locate occurrences of the melody which is searched.

Dynamic alignment procedures are described for the three representations. Multiple continuity constraints are explored and a modified dynamic alignment procedure is described for the histogram representation. We measure the performance of the three representations using a collection of naturally sung queries applied to a target database of varying size.

A suitable audio fingerprint can be used to identify audio files, even if they are severely degraded due to compression or other types of signal processing operations. When degraded, the fingerprint closely resembles the fingerprint of the original, but is not identical. We plan to use a fingerprint not only to identify the song but also to assess the perceptual quality of the compressed content. In order to develop such a fingerprinting scheme, a model is needed to assess the behavior of a fingerprint subject to compression. In this paper we present the initial outlines of a model for an existing robust fingerprinting system to develop a more theoretical foundation.

It is shown that, for the results to agree with the listener’s understanding, computer modelling needs to follow as closely as possible the strategies undertaken during the listening process. Motivic patterns, which may progressively follow different musical dimensions, are discovered through an adaptive incremental identification in a multi-dimensional parametric space. The combinatorial redundancy that would logically result from the model is carefully limited with the help of particular heuristics. In particular, a notion of specificity relation between pattern descriptions is defined, unifying suffix relation – between patterns – and inclusion relation – between the multi-parametric descriptions of patterns. This enables to discard redundant patterns, whose descriptions are less specific than other patterns and whose occurrences are included in the occurrences of the more specific patterns.

The method has been applied to a variety of musical genres, in the context of Greek traditional music where music meter can be 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 7/8, 9/8, 12/8 and tempo ranges from 40bpm to 330bpm.

Based on these principles, many divergent theories of melodic segmentation and representation have been proposed. However, these theories have not succeeded in achieving a comprehensive and verifiable representation of melody. This is largely due to the fact that multiple competing segmenting factors produce, for any single melody, a large number of possible segmentations and therefore representations. Here a model is proposed, which incorporates widely accepted principles of segmentation. These rules govern three types of factors: (1) changes in proximity (for producing disjunctive segmentation), (2) changes in overall contour and intervallic texture and (3) patterns and periodicity that create parallelism among segments. Because of the nature of the segmentation rules, these same rules establish the attributes of the groups they produce.

As part of this research target, this study presents a first attempt to automatically identify the language sung in a music recording. It is assumed that each language has its own set of constraints that specify which of the basic linguistic events present in a singing process are allowed to follow another. The acoustic structure of individual languages may, thus, be characterized by statistically modeling those constraints. To this end, the proposed method employs vector clustering to convert a singing signal from its spectrum-based feature representation into a sequence of smaller basic phonological units. The dynamic characteristics of the sequence are then analyzed by using bigram language models. Since the vector clustering is performed in an unsupervised manner, the resulting system does not use sophisticated linguistic knowledge and, thus, is easily portable to new language sets. In addition, to eliminate the interference of background music, we leverage the statistical estimation of a piece’s music background so that the vector clustering is relevant to the solo singing voices in the accompanied signals.",TWN,education,Developing economies,"[6.8405085, -39.62733]","[-1.0559886, -22.079401]","[-6.9560957, -11.020103, -17.537472]","[4.2546406, 4.365588, -4.02745]","[8.852449, 11.862713]","[9.853045, 3.7742789]","[8.872141, 15.2596855, 0.61753094]","[8.134548, 4.374798, -0.830113]"

One solution is to let software agents learn to make the annotator’s task easier and more efficient. Emo is a music annotation prototype that combines inputs from both human and software agents to better study human listening. A compositional theory of musical meaning provides the overall heuristics for the annotation process, with the listener drawing upon different influences such as acoustics, lyrics and cultural metadata to focus on a specific musical mood. Software agents track the way these choices are made from the influences available. A functional theory of human emotion provides the basis for introducing necessary bias into the machine learning agents. Conflicting positive and negative emotions can be separated on the basis of their different function (reward-approach and threat-avoidance) or dysfunction (psychotic). Negative emotions have strong ambiguity and these are the focus of the experiment.

The latter method then can detect all the onsets of each drum by using the corresponding adapted template. The onsets of bass and snare drums in any piece can thus be identified.

The automatic recognition of musical chords is necessary for music information retrieval (MIR) systems, since the chord sequences of musical pieces capture the characteristics of their accompaniments. None of the previous methods can accurately recognize musical chords from complex audio signals that contain vocal and drum sounds. The main problem is that the chord-boundary-detection and chord-symbol-identification processes are inseparable because of their mutual dependency. In order to solve this mutual dependency problem, our method generates hypotheses about tuples of chord symbols and chord boundaries, and outputs the most plausible one as the recognition result. The certainty of a hypothesis is evaluated based on three cues: acoustic features, chord progression patterns, and bass sounds.

Yet, despite the popularity of Web services in the business sector and their seemingly obvious applicability to the digital library domain, and to MIR in particular, the adoption of these new protocols has not been widespread. To demonstrate the tremendous potential of Web services for MIR, this paper presents an application using the Google and Amazon.com databases to generate clusters of related musical artists based on cultural metadata. The use of cultural metadata to determine artist relatedness is valuable and interesting because it captures emergent popular opinion about music. Starting from an initial seed artist, Amazon Listmania! lists are traversed to find potentially related artists. Google is used to determine which of these candidates are in fact related by assessing the co-occurrence of the two artists’ names on Internet web pages. A list of artists related to the seed is returned once a given number of artists is found. The positive results generated by the system illustrate the use of Web services for exploiting the vast amount of untapped data that are available today and highlight their importance for the future, when even more musical data will become available.",CAN,education,Developed economies,"[16.349918, 21.371283]","[33.991077, 8.704648]","[18.380568, -0.04725307, -1.79651]","[4.449923, 14.792139, 15.467443]","[12.9522505, 8.855389]","[5.1377916, 1.4288806]","[11.930423, 16.581932, 0.511549]","[5.1632867, 2.5148578, 0.14667512]"

To evaluate computer-based chord labeling procedures, one requires ground truth annotations for the underlying audio material. However, the manual generation of such annotations on the basis of audio recordings is tedious and time-consuming. On the other hand, trained musicians can easily derive chord labels from symbolic score data. In this paper, we bridge this gap by describing a procedure that allows for transferring annotations and chord labels from the score domain to the audio domain and vice versa. Using music synchronization techniques, the general idea is to locally warp the annotations of all given data streams onto a common time axis, which then allows for a cross-domain evaluation of the various types of chord labels. As a further contribution of this paper, we extend this principle by introducing a multi-perspective evaluation framework for simultaneously comparing chord recognition results over multiple performances of the same piece of music.

A multivariate autoregressive (MAR) model was trained on the improved MFCCs, and performance in the task of genre classification was evaluated. By combining features calculated on the separated signals, relative error rate reductions of 20% and 16.2% were obtained when an SVM classifier was trained on the MFCCs and MAR features respectively. Next, by analyzing the MAR features calculated on the separated signals, it was concluded that the original signal contained some information which the MAR model was capable of handling, and that the best performance was obtained when all three signals were used.

A measure of subbeat quaver (1/8th note) alternation is used to compare half time and double time measures against the initial beat track estimation and indicate a likely octave error.

In practice, however, this assumption is often violated. For example, a performer may deviate from the score by ignoring a repeat or introducing an additional repeat that is not written in the score. In this paper, we introduce a synchronization approach that can cope with such structural differences. As main technical contribution, we describe a novel variant of dynamic time warping (DTW), referred to as JumpDTW, which allows for handling jumps and repeats in the alignment.

Conventional methods face a crucial problem known as model selection because they assume that the observed spectra are superpositions of a certain fixed number of bases (sound sources and/or finer parts). iLHA avoids this problem by assuming that the observed spectra are superpositions of a stochastically-distributed unbounded (theoretically infinite) number of bases. Such uncertainty can be treated in a principled way by leveraging the state-of-the-art paradigm of machine learning called Bayesian nonparametrics. To represent a set of time-sliced spectral strips, we formulated nested infinite Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) based on hierarchical and generalized Dirichlet processes. Each strip is allowed to contain an unbounded number of sound sources (GMMs), each of which is allowed to contain an unbounded number of harmonic partials (Gaussians). To train the nested infinite GMMs efficiently, we used a modern inference technique called collapsed variational Bayes (CVB). Our experiments using audio recordings of real piano and guitar performances showed that fully automated iLHA based on noninformative priors performed as well as optimally tuned conventional methods.",JPN,facility,Developed economies,"[-45.02099, 7.2765193]","[-39.8127, -26.68829]","[-29.999067, 6.0246205, 11.862105]","[-4.0751996, -14.128901, -35.701702]","[7.812578, 9.281828]","[10.674704, 4.6349463]","[9.395286, 13.262276, 0.673982]","[8.895932, 5.373043, -0.18715279]"

Yoo+Korea Advanced Institute of Science Technology>KOR>education,"This paper considers a particle filter based algorithm to extract melody from a polyphonic audio in the short-time Fourier transforms (STFT) domain. The extraction is focused on overcoming the difficulties due to harmonic / percussive sound interferences, possibility of octave mismatch, and dynamic variation in melody. The main idea of the algorithm is to consider probabilistic relations between melody and polyphonic audio. Melody is assumed to follow a Markov process, and the framed segments of polyphonic audio are assumed to be conditionally independent given the parameters that represent the melody. The melody parameters are estimated using sequential importance sampling (SIS) which is a conventional particle filter method. In this paper, the likelihood and state transition are defined to overcome the aforementioned difficulties. The SIS algorithm relies on sequential importance density, and this density is designed using multiple pitches which are estimated by a simple multi-pitch extraction algorithm. Experimental results show that the considered algorithm outperforms other famous melody extraction algorithms in terms of the raw pitch accuracy (RPA) and the raw chroma accuracy (RCA).",KOR,education,Developing economies,"[0.59979963, -29.37336]","[-12.366784, -41.959766]","[-11.582522, -2.7118323, -13.087276]","[2.6487956, 9.404878, -14.130859]","[8.767093, 10.528087]","[10.313078, 3.0400794]","[8.7231, 14.477755, 1.7252947]","[9.185672, 4.0620975, -0.38913184]"

In classical music, there are many interpretations to a particular piece, and finding “the” interpretation that matches the listener’s taste allows a listener to further enjoy the piece. The critical issue in finding such an interpretation is the way or interface to allow the listener to listen through different interpretations. Our interface allows a user, by swinging a conducting hardware interface, to conduct the desired global tempo along the playback of a piece, at any time in the piece. The real-time conducting input by the user dynamically switches the interpretation being played back to the one closest to how the user is currently conducting. At the end of the piece, our interface ranks each interpretation according to how close the tempo of each interpretation was to the user input. At the core of our interface is an automated tempo estimation method based on audio-score alignment. We improve tempo estimation by requiring the audio-score alignment of different interpretations to be consistent with each other. We evaluate the tempo estimation method using a solo, chamber, and orchestral repertoire.

For the second class, a novel feature for the tempo induction task is presented; the strengths of the twelve western musical tones at all octaves are calculated for each audio frame, in a similar fashion with Pitch Class Profile. The time-evolving feature vectors are convolved with a bank of resonators, each resonator corresponding to a target tempo. Then the results of each feature class are combined to give the final output. The algorithm was evaluated on the popular ISMIR 2004 Tempo Induction Evaluation Exchange Dataset.

To explore the ways in which these structures are connected with the qualities of sounds, a semantic space was extracted from a large collection of musical tags with latent semantic and cluster analysis. The perceptual and musical properties of 19 clusters were investigated by a similarity rating task that used spliced musical excerpts representing each cluster. The resulting perceptual space denoting the clusters correlated high with selected acoustical features extracted from the stimuli. The first dimension related to the high-frequency energy content, the second to the regularity of the spectrum, and the third to the fluctuations within the spectrum.

By taking advantage of features recently added to the platform, including dynamic audio control and C cross-compilation for near-native performance, we have developed the Audio-processing Library for Flash (ALF), providing developers with a library of common audio processing routines and affording Flash developers a degree of sound interaction previously unavailable through web-based platforms.

Our idea is to look for consistencies in the beat tracking results over multiple performances of the same underlying piece. As another contribution, we further classify the critical passages by specifying musical properties of certain beats that frequently evoke tracking errors. Finally, considering three conceptually different beat tracking procedures, we conduct a case study on the basis of a challenging test set that consists of a variety of piano performances of Chopin Mazurkas.

First, short audio fragments are classified into one of the following categories: speech, solo singing, choir singing, instrumental or bell chiming performance. Then, a set of candidate segment boundaries is obtained by observing how the energy of the signal and its content change, and finally the recording is segmented with a probabilistic model that maximizes the posterior probability of segments given a set of candidate segment boundaries with their probabilities and prior knowledge of lengths of segments belonging to different categories.

These judgements of listeners have a strong psychophysical basis. Therefore, harmony perception often is explained by the notions of dissonance and tension, computing the consonance of one or two intervals. In this paper, a theory on harmony perception based on the notion of periodicity is introduced. Mathematically, periodicity is derivable from the frequency ratios of the tones in the chord with respect to its lowest tone. The used ratios can be computed by continued fraction expansion and are psychophysically motivated by the just noticeable differences in pitch perception.

In this paper, we propose an novel approach for clustering music items represented in social tagging systems. Its characteristic is that it determines similarity between items by preserving the 3-way relationships among the inherent dimensions of the data, i.e., users, items, and tags. Conversely to existing approaches that use reductions to 2-way relationships (between items-users or items-tags), this characteristic allows the proposed algorithm to consider the personal perspectives of tags and to improve the clustering quality. Due to the complexity of social tagging data, we focus on spectral clustering that has been proven effective in addressing complex data. However, existing spectral clustering algorithms work with 2-way relationships. To overcome this problem, we develop a novel data-modeling scheme and a tag-aware spectral clustering procedure that uses tensors (high-dimensional arrays) to store the multi-graph structures that capture the personalised aspects of similarity.

We describe several techniques for aggregating or choosing among the multiple estimates that result from this process to extract a global tempo estimate. The system was evaluated on the MIREX 2006 training database as well as a newly constructed database of rhythmically complex electronic music consisting of 27 examples (IDM DB).

In this paper, we introduce a novel mid-level representation which captures predominant local pulse information. To this end, we first derive a tempogram by performing a local spectral analysis on a previously extracted, possibly very noisy onset representation. From this, we derive for each time position the predominant tempo as well as a sinusoidal kernel that best explains the local periodic nature of the onset representation. Then, our main idea is to accumulate the local kernels over time yielding a single function that reveals the predominant local pulse (PLP). We show that this function constitutes a robust mid-level representation from which one can derive musically meaningful tempo and beat information for non-percussive music even in the presence of significant tempo fluctuations. Furthermore, our representation allows for incorporating prior knowledge on the expected tempo range to exhibit information on different pulse levels.""",DEU,education,Developed economies,"[-49.96212, -6.7917223]","[-21.017872, -24.59171]","[-1.45258, -26.619326, -0.58014065]","[0.44937864, -19.398243, -6.5341654]","[9.613007, 5.1604133]","[11.055803, 1.7444718]","[12.394307, 11.807706, 0.8282774]","[10.105646, 3.3791404, 1.02735]"

It offers an XML-based file format, object models for internal representation in various programming languages, and software libraries and tools for reading and writing XML and for data transformations. Chronicle defines basic blocks for representing time-based information using events, a hierarchy of groups and instantiable templates. It supports two modes of timing: local timing within a group and association with other elements. The built-in mechanism for resolving time references can be used to implement both timescale mappings and tagging of information. Chronicle aims to be a powerful and flexible foundation on which new file formats and software can be built. Chronicle focuses on structure and timing, but leaves the actual content free to choose. Thus format- or software-developers can specify their own domain-model.

These endeavors incur a large computational cost, and could potentially benefit greatly from more rapid calculation of acoustic features. Traditional, cluster-based solutions for large-scale feature extraction are expensive and space- and power-inefficient. Using the massively parallel architecture of the field programmable gate array (FPGA), it is possible to design an application specific chip rivaling the speed of a cluster for large-scale acoustic feature computation at lower cost. Recent advances in development tools, such as the Xilinx Blockset in Simulink, allow rapid prototyping, simulation, and implementation on actual hardware. Such devices also show potential for the implementation of MIR systems on embedded devices such as cell phones and PDAs where hardware acceleration would be an absolute necessity. We present a prototype library for acoustic feature calculation for implementation on Xilinx FPGA hardware.

Moreover, many people think about sound in individualistic terms (such as “boomy”) that may not have clear mappings onto the controls of existing audio tools. We propose learning to map subjective audio descriptors, such as “boomy”, onto measures of signal properties in order to build a simple controller that manipulates an audio reverberator in terms of a chosen descriptor. For example, “make the sound less boomy”. In the learning process, a user is presented with a series of sounds altered in different ways by a reverberator and asked to rate how well each sound represents the audio concept. The system correlates these ratings with reverberator parameters to build a controller that manipulates reverberation in the user’s terms. In this paper, we focus on developing the mapping between reverberator controls, measures of qualities of reverberation and user ratings.

In much of this research, it is convenient to think of beats as occurring at precise time points. However, anyone who has attempted to label beats by hand soon realizes that precise annotation of music audio is not possible. A common method of beat annotation is simply to tap along with audio and record the tap times. This raises the question: How accurate are the taps? It may seem that an answer to this question would require knowledge of “true” beat times. However, tap times can be characterized as a random distribution around true beat times. Multiple independent taps can be used to estimate not only the location of the true beat time, but also the statistical distribution of measured tap times around the true beat time. Thus, without knowledge of true beat times, and without even requiring the existence of precise beat times, we can estimate the uncertainty of tap times.

The pitch and timbre information are used in organizing individual notes into sound sources. In the recognition, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are used to represent the coarse shape of the power spectrum of sound sources and Gaussian mixture models are used to model instrument-conditional densities of the extracted features.

In hybrid recommendation, it is necessary to deal with musical contents that are usually represented as continuous vectorial values. To do this, we propose a continuous pLSI that incorporates Gaussian mixture models. This extension, however, causes a severe local optima problem because it increases the number of parameters drastically. This is considered to be a major factor generating “hubs,” which are items that are inappropriately recommended to almost all users. To solve this problem, we tested three smoothing techniques: multinomial smoothing, Gaussian parameter tying, and artist-based item clustering. The experimental results revealed that although the first method improved nothing, the others significantly improved the recommendation accuracy and reduced the hubness.

It has a number of applications, such as indexing of and searching in musical databases. Traditional music style classification approaches usually assume that each piece of music has a unique style and they make use of the music contents to construct a classifier for classifying each piece into its unique style. However, in reality, a piece may match more than one, even several different styles. Also, in this modern Web 2.0 era, it is easy to get a hold of additional, indirect information (e.g., music tags) about music. This paper proposes a multi-label music style classification approach, called Hypergraph integrated Support Vector Machine (HiSVM), which can integrate both music contents and music tags for automatic music style classification.

While there are a number of ways to collect and generate tags, there is generally a data sparsity problem in which very few songs and artists have been accurately annotated with a sufficiently large set of relevant tags. We explore the idea of tag propagation to help alleviate the data sparsity problem. Tag propagation, originally proposed by Sordo et al., involves annotating a novel artist with tags that have been frequently associated with other similar artists. In this paper, we explore four approaches for computing artists similarity based on different sources of music information (user preference data, social tags, web documents, and audio content). We compare these approaches in terms of their ability to accurately propagate three different types of tags (genres, acoustic descriptors, social tags). We find that the approach based on collaborative filtering performs best.

Although the subject poses a well studied task in Music Information Retrieval, some fundamental issues of genre classification have not been covered so far. Especially many modern genres are influenced by manifold musical styles. Most of all, this holds true for the broad category “World Music”, which comprises many different regional styles and a mutual mix up thereof. A common approach to tackle this issue in manual categorization is to assign multiple genre labels to a single recording. However, for commonly used automatic classification algorithms, multi-labeling poses a problem due to its ambiguities. Thus, we propose to break down multi-label genre annotations into single-label annotations within given time segments and musical domains. A corresponding multi-stage evaluation based on a representative set of items from a global music taxonomy is performed and discussed accordingly.

With this grammar an automatic harmonic analysis of a sequence of symbolic chord labels is obtained in the form of a parse tree. The harmonic similarity is determined by finding and examining the largest labeled common embeddable subtree (LLCES) of two parse trees. For the calculation of the LLCES a new O(min(n, m)nm) time algorithm is presented, where n and m are the sizes of the trees. For the analysis of the LLCES we propose six distance measures that exploit several structural characteristics of the Combined LLCES. We demonstrate in a retrieval experiment that at least one of these new methods significantly outperforms a baseline string matching approach and thereby show that using additional musical knowledge from music cognitive and music theoretic models actually helps improving retrieval performance.",NLD,education,Developed economies,"[-38.70327, 1.7963318]","[-7.8063555, -11.234657]","[-31.76473, 11.906291, 2.6143613]","[-16.746445, 11.35494, 1.5721457]","[8.513226, 9.722666]","[11.236813, 3.337489]","[9.637039, 14.002162, 1.7217346]","[8.394201, 3.167253, -1.74132]"

Note onsets are then reset according to the pitch activation patterns yielded by the matrix factorization. In doing so, we are able to resolve individual notes within a chord.

For most speech recognition algorithms, the performance is measured by word error rate; i.e., only the identity of recognized segments is considered because word boundaries in continuous speech are often ambiguous. In contrast, audio chord detection performance is typically measured in terms of frame error rate, which considers both timing and classification. This paper treats these two tasks separately and focuses on the first problem; i.e., classifying the correct chords given boundary information. The best performing chroma/HMM chord detection algorithm, as measured in the 2008 MIREX Audio Chord Detection Contest, is used as the baseline in this paper.

Given the cost and time required for manual transcription, Optical Music Recognition (OMR) presents itself as a promising alternative. Quite often, OMR systems show acceptable but not perfect performance, which eventually leaves them out of the transcription process. On the assumption that OMR systems might always make some errors, it is essential that the user corrects the output. This paper contributes to a better understanding of how music transcription is improved by the assistance of OMR systems that include the end-user in the recognition process. For that, we have measured the transcription time of a printed early music work under two scenarios: a manual one and a state-of-the-art OMR-assisted one, with several alternatives each.

Specifically, we explore representations from Jukebox (Dhariwal et al. 2020): a music generation system containing a language model trained on codified audio from 1M songs. To determine if Jukebox's representations contain useful information for MIR, we use them as input features to train shallow models on several MIR tasks. Relative to representations from conventional MIR models which are pre-trained on tagging, we find that using representations from Jukebox as input features yields 30% stronger performance on average across four MIR tasks: tagging, genre classification, emotion recognition, and key detection. For key detection, we observe that representations from Jukebox are considerably stronger than those from models pre-trained on tagging, suggesting that pre-training via codified audio language modeling may address blind spots in conventional approaches. We interpret the strength of Jukebox's representations as evidence that modeling audio instead of tags provides richer representations for MIR.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[13.398229, 11.11688]","[-32.60922, 9.092252]","[9.010858, -7.007046, 3.1149924]","[-3.3169317, 15.994336, 4.4298334]","[12.048973, 9.368481]","[7.451157, 5.19081]","[11.14567, 16.058912, 0.7901056]","[6.9278154, 4.60808, 1.3978437]"

While existing approaches can only fill in a short segment with a fixed number of notes, or a fixed time span between the past and future contexts, our model can infill a variable number of notes (up to 128) for different time spans. We achieve so with three major technical contributions. First, we adapt XLNet, an autoregressive model originally proposed for unsupervised model pre-training, to music score infilling. Second, we propose a new, musically specialized positional encoding called relative bar encoding that better informs the model of notes' position within the past and future context. Third, to capitalize relative bar encoding, we perform look-ahead onset prediction to predict the onset of a note one time step before predicting the other attributes of the note.

Based on this, we propose a user-controllable framework that uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to harmonize the melody based on the given chord surprise indication. Through explicit conditions, the model can randomly generate various and harmonic chord progressions for a melody, and the Spearman's correlation and p-value significance show that the resulting chord progressions match the given surprise contour quite well.

Musicians can flexibly adapt their string choice, hand position, and finger placement to maximise expressivity and playability when sounding each note. Violin fingerings therefore serve as important guides in ensuring effective performance, especially for inexperienced players. However, fingering annotations are often missing or only partially available on violin sheet music. Here, we propose a model based on the variational autoencoder that generates violin fingering patterns using only pitch and timing information found on the score. Our model leverages limited existing fingering data with the possibility to learn in a semi-supervised manner. Results indicate that fingering annotations generated by our model successfully imitate the style and preferences of a human performer.

We consider the relation with principal component analysis, which only meets the first of these requirements. Theoretically, the principal components of a repertoire of random walks are known to be cosines. We find, empirically, that the principal components of melodies also closely approximate cosines in multiple musical traditions.

This paper introduces MusicFrameworks, a hierarchical music structure representation and a multi-step generative process to create a full-length melody guided by long-term repetitive structure, chord, melodic contour, and rhythm constraints. We first organize the full melody with section and phrase-level structure. To generate melody in each phrase, we generate rhythm and basic melody using two separate transformer-based networks, and then generate the melody conditioned on the basic melody, rhythm and chords in an auto-regressive manner. By factoring music generation into sub-problems, our approach allows simpler models and requires less data. To customize or add variety, one can alter chords, basic melody, and rhythm structure in the music frameworks, letting our networks generate the melody accordingly. Additionally, we introduce new features to encode musical positional information, rhythm patterns, and melodic contours based on musical domain knowledge.

In this paper, we aim to further extend this idea and examine the feasibility of automatic instrumentation—dynamically assigning instruments to notes in solo music during performance. In addition to the online, real-time-capable setting for performative use cases, automatic instrumentation can also find applications in assistive composing tools in an offline setting. Due to the lack of paired data of original solo music and their full arrangements, we approach automatic instrumentation by learning to separate parts (e.g., voices, instruments and tracks) from their mixture in symbolic multitrack music, assuming that the mixture is to be played on a keyboard. We frame the task of part separation as a sequential multi-class classification problem and adopt machine learning to map sequences of notes into sequences of part labels. To examine the effectiveness of our proposed models, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation over four diverse datasets of different genres and ensembles—Bach chorales, string quartets, game music and pop music.

 However, the explicit voice assignment of a piece (if present at all)

 Instead, voice-leading phenomena can occur in free textures (e.g., in most keyboard music),

 This paper presents a model of proto-voices,
 voice-like structures that encode sequential and vertical relations between notes
 without the need to assume explicit voices.
 Proto-voices are constructed by recursive combination of primitive structural operations,
 such as insertion of neighbor or passing notes,
 or horizontalization of simultaneous notes.
 Together, these operations give rise to a grammar-like hierarchical system
 that can be used to infer the structural fabric of a piece using a chart parsing algorithm.

 We design a deep recurrent neural network model that only requires information readily available in all kinds of MIDI files, including performances, or other symbolic encodings. We release a model trained on the ASAP dataset. Our system can be used with these pre-trained parameters and is easy to integrate into a MIR pipeline. We also propose a data augmentation procedure that helps re-training on small datasets.

The items on the shelves correspond to fingerprints, and purchasing an item corresponds to doing a fingerprint lookup in the database. From this perspective, we show that previous approaches are extremely inefficient marketplaces in which the consumer has very few choices and adopts an irrational buying strategy. The main contribution of this work is to propose a novel fingerprinting scheme called marketplace fingerprinting. This approach redesigns the system to be an efficient marketplace in which the consumer has many options and adopts a rational buying strategy that explicitly considers the cost and expected utility of each item. We also show that deciding which fingerprints to include in the database poses a type of minimax problem in which the store and the consumer have competing interests.

In order to assist the user, the sound matching task aims to estimate synthesis parameters that produce a sound closest to the query sound. Recently, neural networks have been employed for this task. These neural networks are trained on paired data of synthesis parameters and the corresponding output sound, optimizing a loss of synthesis parameters. However, synthesis parameters are only indirectly correlated with the audio output. Another problem is that query made by the user usually consists of real-world sounds, different from the synthesizer output used during training. 
 In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the problem of synthesizer sound matching by implementing a basic subtractive synthesizer using differentiable DSP modules. This synthesizer has interpretable controls and is similar to those used in music production. We can then train an estimator network by directly optimizing the spectral similarity of the synthesized output. Furthermore, we can train the network on real-world sounds whose ground-truth synthesis parameters are unavailable. We pre-train the network with parameter loss and fine-tune the model with spectral loss using real-world sounds.

We can reduce this complexity by several orders of magnitude by treating each label (e.g. key or chord quality) independently. However this has been shown to lead to incoherent output labels. To solve this issue we introduce a modified Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimation (NADE) as the last layer of a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network.

The employed method to record tapping responses in audio format facilitates a fine-grained analysis of metrical accents that emerge from the responses. The identified differences between groups are related to the metrical structures inherent to the two musical styles, such as non-isochronicity of the beat, and differences between the groups document the influence of the deep enculturation of participants to their style of expertise.

This approach, however, relies heavily on a periodicity-aware post-processing step that detects beat times from the noisy probability sequence. To mitigate this problem, we have designed a DNN that estimates the beat phase at each frame whose period is equal to the beat interval. The estimation losses computed at all frames not limited to a fewer number of beat frames can thus be effectively used for backpropagation-based supervised training, whereas a DNN has conventionally been trained such that it constantly outputs zero at all non-beat frames. The same applies to downbeat estimation. We also modify the post-processing method for the estimated phase sequence. For joint beat and downbeat detection, we investigate multi-task learning architectures that output beat and downbeat phases in this order, in reverse order, and in parallel.

 tools for generating post-hoc, model-agnostic explanations of a
 model's classification decisions. The basic idea is to identify
 a small set of human-understandable features of the classified example that are most influential on the classifier's prediction.
 These are then presented as an explanation.
 Evaluation of such explanations in publications often resorts to
 accepting what matches the expectation of a human without actually being able to verify if what the explanation shows is what really caused the model's prediction.
 This paper reports on targeted investigations where we try to get more insight into the actual veracity of LIME's explanations in an audio classification task.
 We deliberately design adversarial examples for the classifier, in a way that
 gives us knowledge about which parts of the input are potentially responsible
 for the model's (wrong) prediction. Asking LIME to explain the predictions for these adversaries permits us to study whether local explanations do indeed detect these regions
 of interest. We also look at whether LIME is more successful in finding perturbations that are more prominent and easily noticeable for a human.

Developing from classical major-minor tonality, the harmonic language of extended tonality forms its own set of rules and regularities, which are a result of the freer combinatoriality of chords within phrases, non-standard chord forms, the emancipation of dissonance, and the loosening of the concept of key. These phenomena posit a challenge for formal, mathematical theory building. The theoretical model proposed in this paper proceeds from Neo-Riemannian and Tonfeld theory, a systematic but informal music-theoretical framework for extended tonality.

Particularly in polyphonic singing, where all musicians can continuously adapt their pitch, this leads to complex interactions. To achieve an overall balanced sound, the musicians dynamically adjust their intonation considering musical, perceptual, and acoustical aspects. When adapting the intonation in a recorded performance, a sound engineer may have to individually fine-tune the pitches of all voices to account for these aspects in a similar way. In this paper, we formulate intonation adaptation as a cost minimization problem. As our main contribution, we introduce a differentiable cost measure by adapting and combining existing principles for measuring intonation. In particular, our measure consists of two terms, representing a tonal aspect (the proximity to a tonal grid) and a harmonic aspect (the perceptual dissonance between salient frequencies).

Sometimes exaggerated, and sometimes subtle, these distortions are driven by a variety of factors, including schematic features (both structural such as phrase boundaries and surface events such as recurrent rhythmic patterns), as well as relatively rare veridical events that characterize the individuality and uniqueness of a particular piece. 
 Performers tend to adopt similar pervasive approaches to interpreting schemas, resulting in common performance practices, while often formulating less common approaches to the interpretation of veridical events. Furthermore, some performers choose anomalous interpretations of schemas. We present a machine learning model of expressive performance of Chopin Mazurkas and a critical analysis of the output based upon statistical analyses of the musical scores and of recorded performances. We compare the timings of recorded human performances of selected Mazurkas by Frédéric Chopin with performances of the same works generated by a neural network trained with recorded human performances of the entire corpus.

However, most models are only applicable to short-term music, while learning long-term music representations remains a challenging task. We have seen several studies attempting to learn hierarchical representations directly in an end-to-end manner, but these models have not been able to achieve the desired results and the training process is not stable. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn long-term symbolic music representations through contextual constraints. First, we use contrastive learning to pre-train a long-term representation by constraining its difference from the short-term representation (extracted by an off-the-shelf model).

Traditional chroma features relying on signal processing are often influenced by timbral properties such as overtones or vibrato and, thus, only roughly correspond to the pitch classes indicated by a score. Deep learning provides a promising possibility to overcome such problems but requires large annotated datasets. Previous approaches therefore use either synthetic audio, MIDI-piano recordings, or chord annotations for training. Since these strategies have different limitations, we propose to learn transcription-like pitch-class representations using pre-synchronized score-audio pairs of classical music. We train several CNNs with musically inspired architectures and evaluate their pitch-class estimates for various instrumentations including orchestra, piano, chamber music, and singing. Moreover, we illustrate the learned features' behavior when used as input to a chord recognition system. In all our experiments, we compare cross-validation with cross-dataset evaluation.

Since traditional chroma variants obtained with signal processing suffer from timbral artifacts such as overtones or vibrato, they do not directly reflect the pitch classes notated in the score. For this reason, training a chroma representation using deep learning (""deep chroma"") has become an interesting strategy. Existing approaches involve the use of supervised learning with strongly aligned labels for which, however, only few datasets are available. Recently, the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, initially proposed for speech, has been adopted to learn monophonic (single-label) pitch-class features using weakly aligned labels based on corresponding score--audio segment pairs. To exploit this strategy for the polyphonic case, we propose the use of a multi-label variant of this CTC loss, the MCTC, and formalize this loss for the pitch-class scenario. Our experiments demonstrate that the weakly aligned approach achieves almost equivalent pitch-class estimates than training with strongly aligned annotations. We then study the sensitivity of our approach to segment duration and mismatch.

However, this approach has a critical limitation that it has no way to deal with musical pieces including undefined musical instruments. To overcome this limitation, we estimate a condensed pitchgram with an existing instrument-independent neural multi-pitch estimator and then separate the pitchgram into a specified number of musical instrument parts with a deep spherical clustering technique. To improve the performance of transcription, we propose a joint spectrogram and pitchgram clustering method based on the timbral and pitch characteristics of musical instruments. The experimental results show that the proposed method can transcribe musical pieces including unknown musical instruments as well as those containing only predefined instruments, at the state-of-the-art transcription accuracy.",JPN,education,Developed economies,"[-22.65672, -17.422224]","[-38.781345, -5.958323]","[-11.704543, -14.731283, 9.407226]","[-8.169053, -3.8344924, -20.927965]","[8.4577265, 8.10327]","[9.260794, 5.535167]","[9.893353, 13.376033, 0.25336283]","[8.440031, 5.078155, 1.9200093]"

While recent breakthroughs have focussed on network architecture, we demonstrate that the representation of the sequence can make an equally significant contribution to the performance of the model as measured by validation set loss. By extracting salient features inherent to the training dataset, the model can either be conditioned on these features or trained to predict said features as extra components of the sequences being modelled. We show that training a neural network to predict a seemingly more complex sequence, with extra features included in the series being modelled, can improve overall model performance significantly. We first introduce TonicNet, a GRU-based model trained to initially predict the chord at a given time-step before then predicting the notes of each voice at that time-step, in contrast with the typical approach of predicting only the notes.

These studies are commonly verified through self-reporting emotion-based surveys. This paper proposes the ""retention rate"" as an additional parameter for evaluation. The ""retention rate"" is one at which the listener revisits the novel items. The authors hypothesize that when a person listens to novel (i.e., both unfamiliar and interesting) pieces of music, the retention rate will be proportional to the number of times the discovery engine suggests the pieces to her, as long as they remain novel. The authors have tested the hypothesis through a six-week human-subject experiment that simulates a real-world listening environment and a follow-up survey. During the experiment period, each subject received, through Discover Weekly in Spotify, suggestions for novel songs up to three times and provided evaluation. One month after the evaluation experiment, the human-subjects answered whether they had revisited the novel songs. Through the analysis of the response and survey data, the researchers conclude that the more times a listener is exposed to a song during the discovery process, the more likely she is to return to the song.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[42.33016, 28.073496]","[31.444403, 38.9464]","[27.629124, 20.783243, -2.1112893]","[6.969151, 1.0482316, 33.320644]","[15.047706, 9.942408]","[4.06148, 2.7694058]","[12.716598, 17.992258, 2.0154157]","[4.1453567, 2.676257, 0.8275511]"

Across its different occurrences in the score, a leitmotif may undergo considerable musical variations. The concrete leitmotif instances in an audio recording are subject to acoustic variability. Our paper approaches the task of classifying such leitmotif instances in audio recordings. As our main contribution, we conduct a case study on a dataset covering 16 recorded performances of the Ring with annotations of ten central leitmotifs, leading to 2403 occurrences and 38448 instances in total. We build a neural network classification model and evaluate its ability to generalize across different performances and leitmotif occurrences.

We address this issue in two ways: (1) we recast the problem to be based on raw sheet music images rather than a symbolic music format, and (2) we propose an approach that can be trained on unlabeled data.  Our approach first converts the sheet music image into a sequence of musical ``words"" based on the bootleg feature representation, and then feeds the sequence into a text classifier.  We show that it is possible to significantly improve classifier performance by first training a language model on a set of unlabeled data, initializing the classifier with the pretrained language model weights, and then finetuning the classifier on a small amount of labeled data.  We train AWD-LSTM, GPT-2, and RoBERTa language models on all piano sheet music images in IMSLP.  We find that transformer-based architectures outperform CNN and LSTM models, and pretraining boosts classification accuracy for the GPT-2 model from 46% to 70% on a 9-way classification task.

A typical strategy is to compare score–audio pairs based on a common mid-level representation, such as chroma features. Several recent studies demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning models that learn task-specific mid-level representations from temporally aligned training pairs. However, in practice, there is often a lack of strongly aligned training data, in particular for real-world scenarios. In our study, we use weakly aligned score–audio pairs for training, where only the beginning and end of a score excerpt is annotated in an audio recording, without aligned correspondences in between. To exploit such weakly aligned data, we employ the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss to train a deep learning model for computing an enhanced chroma representation. We then apply this model to a cross-modal retrieval task, where we aim at finding relevant audio recordings of Western classical music, given a short monophonic musical theme in symbolic notation as a query.

We collected perceptual data from 20 partici-pants for 17 adjudicated copyright cases from the USA and Japan after editing the disputed sections to contain either full audio, melody only, or lyrics only. Due to the historical emphasis in legal opinions on melody as the key criterion for deciding infringement, we predicted that listening to melody-only versions would result in percep-tual judgements that more closely matched actual past legal decisions. Surprisingly, however, we found no sig-nificant differences between the three conditions, with participants matching past decisions in between 50-60% of cases in all three conditions. Automated algorithms designed to calculate melodic and audio similarity pro-duced comparable results: both algorithms were able to match past decisions with identical accuracy of 71% (12/17 cases). Analysis of cases that were difficult to classify suggests that melody, lyrics, and other factors sometimes interact in complex ways difficult to capture using quantitative metrics. We propose directions for fur-ther investigation of the role of similarity in music copy-right law using larger and more diverse samples of cases and enhanced methods, and adapting our perceptual ex-periment method to avoid relying for ground truth data only on court decisions (which may be subject to selec-tion bias).

Although chorus-section detection using audio signals has been studied, whether chorus sections can be detected from text-only lyrics is an open issue. Another open issue is whether patterns of repeating lyric lines such as those appearing in chorus sections depend on language. To investigate these issues, we propose a neural network-based model for sequence labeling. It can learn phrase repetition and linguistic features to detect chorus sections in lyrics text. It is, however, difficult to train this model since there was no dataset of lyrics with chorus-section annotations as there was no prior work on this task. We therefore generate a large amount of training data with such annotations by leveraging pairs of musical audio signals and their corresponding manually time-aligned lyrics; we first automatically detect chorus sections from the audio signals and then use their temporal positions to transfer them to the line-level chorus-section annotations for the lyrics. Experimental results show that the proposed model with the generated data contributes to detecting the chorus sections, that the model trained on Japanese lyrics can detect chorus sections surprisingly well in English lyrics and that patterns of repeating lyric lines are language-independent.",JPN,facility,Developed economies,"[28.130005, -28.718815]","[-29.002037, 6.6505976]","[-2.158523, 17.464434, -20.029655]","[7.9517674, 6.2381186, -26.34734]","[9.716957, 12.495934]","[8.236817, 5.1228213]","[8.707568, 16.274109, 1.0468711]","[7.3869176, 5.126684, 1.2358193]"

To solve this problem, we propose chord jazzification, a process to generate realistic chord configurations in jazz style. With deep learning approaches, we decompose chord jazzification into coloring and voicing. Coloring concerns the choice of color tones, while voicing concerns the configurations of chords. We also create a new dataset featuring interpretations of chord symbols in pop-jazz compositions.

Future multimodal MIR systems may benefit from taking these aspects into account.

Nevertheless, this problem remains arduous, as there are no known functions nor differentiable approximations to transform symbolic music with control of musical attributes.In this work, we propose a novel method that enables attributes-aware music transformation from any set of musical annotations, without requiring complicated derivative implementation. By relying on an adversarial confusion criterion on given musical annotations, we force the latent space of a generative model to abstract from these features. Then, reintroducing these features as conditioning to the generative function, we obtain a continuous control over them. To demonstrate our approach, we rely on sets of musical attributes computed by the jSymbolic library as annotations and conduct experiments that show that our method outperforms previous methods in control.

One of the most important features of this structure is the organisation of modulations between different keys throughout a piece.

However, these prototypes still require empirical validation based on quantitative statistical methods and cannot be retrieved automatically so far.In this paper, we present a novel method to infer prototypical modulation plans from musical corpora. A modulation plan is formalised as a transposition-invariant probabilistic model over the underlying pitch class distributions based on a hierarchical pitch scape representation. Prototypical modulation plans can be learned in an unsupervised manner by training a mixture model (similar to a Gaussian mixture model) on the data, so that different prototypes appear as distinct clusters.We evaluate our approach by performing hierarchical clustering on a corpus of more than 150 Baroque pieces, with the extracted clusters showing excellent agreement with the most common prototypes postulated in music theory.

We focus on the task of symbol-based, monophonic, harmony-constrained jazz improvisations. Our personalization pipeline begins with BebopNet, a music language model trained on a corpus of jazz improvisations by Bebop giants. BebopNet is able to generate improvisations based on any given chord progression. We then assemble a personalized dataset, labeled by a specific user, and train a user-specific metric that reflects this user's unique musical taste. Finally, we employ a personalized variant of beam-search with BebopNet to optimize the generated jazz improvisations for that user. We present an extensive empirical study in which we apply this pipeline to extract individual models as implicitly defined by several human listeners. Our approach enables an objective examination of subjective personalized models whose performance is quantifiable.

One approach for improving the browsing experience is music thumbnailing: the procedure of finding a continuous fragment that can represent the whole musical piece. This paper proposes a human-centred approach to creating thumbnails based on listeners' perception, directly asking listeners to identify the most characteristic fragment. We carried out a user study to assign representativeness scores to multiple fragments from a selection of popular music tracks. To strengthen the results, we performed a replication of the same user study with new participants and a different set of music. Thereafter, we used audio features, the segmentation algorithm, and participants' overall familiarity with the songs to predict representativeness scores. The results suggest that neither segmentation nor familiarity have a significant impact on users' thumbnail preferences: even segments with starting points that pay no regard to song structure can be suitable thumbnails. Three high-level audio characteristics, however, do impact the perceived representativeness of a fragment: Raw Intensity, Melodic Conventionality, and Conventionally of Intensity.

Due to the scarcity of publicly available multi-track choir recordings, we create a dataset of synthesized Bach chorales. We apply data augmentation to alter the chorales so that they more faithfully represent music from a broader range of choral genres. For separation we employ Wave-U-Net, a time-domain convolutional neural network (CNN) originally proposed for vocals and accompaniment separation. We show that Wave-U-Net outperforms a baseline implemented using score-informed NMF (non-negative matrix factorization). We introduce score-informed Wave-U-Net to incorporate the musical score into the separation process. We experiment with different score conditioning methods and show that conditioning on the score leads to improved separation results. We propose a 'score-guided' model variant in which separation is guided by the score alone, bypassing the need to specify the identity of the extracted source. Finally, we evaluate our models (trained on synthetic data only) on real choir recordings and find that in the absence of a large training set of real recordings, NMF still performs better than Wave-U-Net in this setting.

We propose a novel alignment algorithm called Hierarchical DTW that can handle jumps and repeats even when jump locations are not known.  It first performs alignment at the feature level on each sheet music line, and then performs a second alignment at the segment level.  By operating at the segment level, it is able to encode domain knowledge about how likely a particular jump is.

First, we analyze the perception of beat and meter by asking 10 Colombian musicians to perform beat annotations in a dataset of bambucos. Results show  great diversity in the annotations: a total of five different meters or meter combinations were found in the annotations, with each bambuco in the study being annotated in at least two different meters. Second, we perform a beat tracking analysis in a dataset of bambucos with two state-of-the-art algorithms.  Given that the algorithms used in the analysis were designed to deal with the rhythmic regularity of a single meter, it is not surprising that tracking performance is not very high (~42% mean F-measure). However, a deeper analysis of  the onset detection functions used for beat tracking, indicate that there is enough information on the signal level to characterize the bi-metric behavior of bambucos.

Incorporating mode and playing technique analysis, this study demonstrates that the structural relationship between notes is crucial for detecting mode, and such information also provides extra guidance for the playing technique detection in local-level. In this study, a new dataset is compiled for Guqin performance analysis. The mode detection is achieved by pattern matching, and the predicted results are conjoined with audio features to be inputted into a neural network for playing technique detection. Advanced techniques are developed to optimize the extracted pitch contour from the audio. It is manifest in the results that the global and local features are inter-connected in Guqin music.

This capability is essential to many meaningful applications that synchronize audio with a score in an on-line fashion. Existing algorithms often stumble on certain difficult cases, one of which is piano music. This paper presents a new method to tackle such cases. The method treats tempo as a variable rather than a constant (with constraints), allowing the program to adapt to live performance variations. This is first expressed by a Kalman filter model at the note level, and then by an almost equivalent switching state-space model at the audio frame level. The latter contains both discrete and continuous hidden variables, and is computationally intractable. We show how certain reasonable approximations make the computation manageable. This new method is tested on a dataset of 50 piano excerpts.

Also, considering the scarcity of labeled data in the test phase, we artificially generate large-scale testing data with pitch labels from unlabeled data using an analysis-synthesis method. The results show that the SSL method significantly increases the performance against supervised learning only and the improvement depends on the teacher-student models, the size of unlabeled data, the number of self-training iterations, and other training details.

Our framework, based on variational auto-encoders, takes as input a spectral frame, and encodes pitch and timbre as categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The input is then reconstructed by combining those variables. Under an unsupervised training setting, a major challenge is that encoders are tasked to capture factors of interest with distinct latent representations, without access to the corresponding ground-truth labels. We therefore introduce auxiliary tasks and objectives which leverage pitch shifting as a strategy to create surrogate labels, thereby encouraging the disentanglement of pitch and timbre.

The automation of this process has been object of study for a long time in the field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR), with a wide variety of proposed solutions.

However, most of the recent literature addresses only specific parts of the traditional OMR workflow such as music object detection or symbol classification. In this paper, we progress one step further by proposing a full-page OMR system for Mensural notation scores that consists of simply two processes, which are enough to extract the symbolic music information from a full page. More precisely, our pipeline uses Selectional Auto-Encoders to extract single staff regions, combined with end-to-end staff-level recognition based on Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for retrieving the music notation.

A new measure of structural rhythmic similarity is also shown to correlate more strongly to similarity perception of drum loops than the more commonly used Hamming distance.

Given these difficulties, it is not easy to learn good feature representations with supervised learning techniques, either because of the insufficiency of labels, or the subjectiveness (and hence large variance) in human-annotated labels. In this paper, we present a framework that can learn high-level feature representations with a limited amount of data, by first modelling their corresponding quantifiable low-level attributes. We refer to our proposed framework as Music FaderNets, which is inspired by the fact that low-level attributes can be continuously manipulated by separate ""sliding faders"" through feature disentanglement and latent regularization techniques. High-level features are then inferred from the low-level representations through semi-supervised clustering using Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders (GM-VAEs). Using arousal as an example of a high-level feature, we show that the ""faders"" of our model are disentangled and change linearly w.r.t. the modelled low-level attributes of the generated output music. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model successfully learns the intrinsic relationship between arousal and its corresponding low-level attributes (rhythm and note density), with only 1% of the training set being labelled. Finally, using the learnt high-level feature representations, we explore the application of our framework in style transfer tasks across different arousal states.

We revisit the traditional 'textbook' classification approach (using the final, the range and initial note) as well as the only prior computational study we are aware of, which uses pitch profiles. Both approaches work well, but largely reduce modes to scales and ignore their melodic character. Our main contribution is a model that reaches 93–95% F1 score on mode classification, compared to 86–90% using traditional pitch-based musicological methods. Importantly, it reaches 81–83% even when we discard all absolute pitch information and reduce a melody to its contour. The model uses tf–idf vectors and strongly depends on the choice of units: i.e., how the melody is segmented. If we borrow the syllable or word structure from the lyrics, the model outperforms all of our baselines.

Secondly, is acoustic similarity a good proxy for how an individual might construct a playlist or recommend music to a friend? Thirdly, if so, can we find acoustic features that are related to human judgments of acoustic similarity? To answer these questions, our study asked 117 test subjects to compare two unknown candidate songs relative to a third known reference song.

The most commonly practiced setting for choir ensembles consists of four parts; Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass (SATB), each with its own range of fundamental frequencies (F0s). The task of source separation for this choral setting entails separating the SATB mixture into the constituent parts. Source separation for musical mixtures is well studied and many deep learning based methodologies have been proposed for the same. However, most of the research has been focused on a typical case which consists in separating vocal, percussion and bass sources from a mixture, each of which has a distinct spectral structure. In contrast, the simultaneous and harmonic nature of ensemble singing leads to high structural similarity and overlap between the spectral components of the sources in a choral mixture, making source separation for choirs a harder task than the typical case. This, along with the lack of an appropriate consolidated dataset has led to a dearth of research in the field so far. In this paper we first assess how well some of the recently developed methodologies for musical source separation perform for the case of SATB choirs.

To this end, we create a dataset comprising of 2-bar monophonic melodies where each melody is the result of a unique combination of nine latent factors that span ordinal, categorical, and binary types. The dataset is large enough (? 1.3 million data points) to train and test deep networks for disentanglement learning. In addition, we present benchmarking experiments using popular unsupervised dis- entanglement algorithms on this dataset and compare the results with those obtained on an image-based dataset.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-7.216722, -12.41503]","[-52.888813, 8.422308]","[-15.776078, 16.45433, 5.296453]","[-17.391636, 0.15599597, -19.83157]","[10.822323, 10.053661]","[8.612939, 6.640292]","[10.75169, 14.132173, 2.3608482]","[7.258048, 4.636967, 2.569135]"

Two central methods for representation learning include deep metric learning and classification, both having the same goal of learning a representation that can generalize well across tasks. Along with generalization, the emerging concept of disentangled representations is also of great interest, where multiple semantic concepts (e.g., genre, mood, instrumentation) are learned jointly but remain separable in the learned representation space. In this paper we present a single representation learning framework that elucidates the relationship between metric learning, classification, and disentanglement in a holistic manner. For this, we (1) outline past work on the relationship between metric learning and classification, (2) extend this relationship to multi-label data by exploring three different learning approaches and their disentangled versions, and (3) evaluate all models on four tasks (training time, similarity retrieval, auto-tagging, and triplet prediction). We find that classification-based models are generally advantageous for training time, similarity retrieval, and auto-tagging, while deep metric learning exhibits better performance for triplet-prediction. Finally, we show that our proposed approach yields state-of-the-art results for music auto-tagging.",KOR,education,Developing economies,"[9.748068, -0.63649696]","[-53.61442, 9.122638]","[2.6161966, 12.965643, 5.249747]","[8.640194, -1.879477, -20.014074]","[11.313028, 10.021853]","[7.69396, 5.71155]","[10.931918, 15.117522, 2.23132]","[7.1434474, 4.7895217, 2.1494315]"

We also asked participants a series of free-form questions on music discovery and diversity in semi-structured interviews. User-preferred levels of diversity varied widely both within and between subjects. Although most users agreed that diversity is beneficial in music discovery, they also noted a risk of dissatisfaction from too much diversity.

Music genres are valuable information, especially for music organization, personalized listening experience, and playlist generation. Automatically classifying music genres is a challenging endeavor due to the inherent ambiguity and subjectivity. Most efforts on music genre classification consider the complete independence between labels. However, music genres typically respect a hierarchical structure based on the influences or origins of each style. Conversely, many of the methods available for hierarchical classification are based on assumptions about the class hierarchy, such as the need for multiple children in each hierarchy's node, which may limit their use in music applications. Also, the local classifier per node approach that would be the most suitable for this scenario is costly regarding time and memory. In this paper, we present two local hierarchical classification approaches and show how to combine them to obtain a single one that is more robust and faithful to the music genre classification scenario. We evaluate our proposal in a music dataset hierarchically labeled with 120 music genres.

We set up the subsequence alignment such that the audio features are less sensitive to the tempo or key change of the original track in a mix. This approach provides temporally tight mix-to-track matching from which we can obtain cue-points, transition length, mix segmentation, and musical changes in DJ performance. Using 1,557 mixes from 1001Tracklists including 13,728 tracks and 20,765 transitions, we conduct the proposed analysis and show a wide range of statistics, which may elucidate the creative process of DJ music making.",KOR,education,Developing economies,"[-42.1022, -19.391811]","[8.335984, -42.194252]","[-4.726834, -25.1563, 13.026905]","[3.4204128, -10.23999, -5.979955]","[10.324943, 5.902925]","[9.478505, 0.9228197]","[9.853925, 13.806648, -0.86112726]","[8.884426, 2.687341, 1.3462481]"

Utilization of relevant context in audio sequence is essential for effective prediction. Existing methods have used LSTMs with modest success. In this work we describe three attentive LSTM based approaches for dynamic emotion prediction from music clips. We validate our models through extensive experimentation on standard dataset annotated with arousal-valence values in continuous time, and choose the best performer. We find that the LSTM based attention models perform better than the state of the art transformers for the dynamic emotion prediction task, both in terms of R2 and Kendall-Tau metrics. We explore individual smaller feature sets in search of a more effective one and to understand how different features contribute to perceived emotion. The spectral features are found to perform at par with the generic ComPare feature set [1]. Through attention map analysis we visualize how attention is distributed over music clips' frames for emotion prediction. It is observed that the models attend to frames which contribute to changes in reported arousal-valence values and chroma to produce better emotion predictions, effectively capturing long-term dependencies.",IND,education,Developing economies,"[60.572006, 4.97348]","[10.786708, 47.21909]","[11.067372, 33.759468, -6.468108]","[31.429476, 1.7305878, 5.1593246]","[14.860483, 12.155211]","[4.937791, 6.1079454]","[13.821508, 15.946026, 4.3065104]","[3.9618227, 4.2166386, 1.7041609]"

None of the current approaches deal with such complexity. Most of them consider only simple chord patterns, in the best cases, including sevenths. In addition, when considering symbolic data captured from a MIDI guitar, we need to deal with non quantized and noisy data, which increases the difficulty of the task. The current symbolic approaches deal only with quantized data, with no automatic technique to reduce noise. This paper proposes a new approach to recognize chords, from symbolic MIDI guitar data, called COCHONUT (Complex Chords Nutting). The system uses contextual harmonic information to solve ambiguous cases, integrated with other techniques, such as decision theory, optimization, pattern matching and rule-based recognition.

The chord information is then analyzed using an array of voicing vectors (VV) indicating likelihood for chord voicings based on constraints of the instrument.

A probabilistic framework is devised to uniformly integrate bass lines extracted by using bass pitch estimation into a hypothesis-search-based chord recognition. To prune the hypothesis space of the search, the hypothesis reliability is defined as the weighted sum of three reliabilities: the likelihood of Gaussian Mixture Models for the observed features, the joint probability of chord and bass pitch, and the chord transition N-gram probability.

We present a new approach which uses as a basis a relatively simple chroma model to represent short-time sonorities derived from melody range and bass range chromagrams. A chord is then modelled as a mixture of these sonorities, or subchords. We prove the practicability of the model by implementing a hidden Markov model (HMM) for chord labelling, in which we use the discrete subchord features as observations. We model gamma-distributed chord durations by duplicate states in the HMM, a technique that had not been applied to chord labelling.

Melody prediction is one of the most difficult problems in musical information retrieval because composers and players may or may not create melodies that conform to our expectation. The development of a melody expectation method is thus important for building a system that supports musical novices because melody expectation is one of the most basic skills for a musician. Unlike most previous prediction methods, which use statistical learning, our method evaluates the appropriateness of each candidate note from the view point of musical theory. In particular, it uses the concept of melody stability based on the generative theory of tonal music (GTTM) and the tonal pitch space (TPS) to evaluate the appropriateness of the melody. It can thus predict the candidate next notes not only from the surface structure of the melody but also from the deeper structure of the melody acquired by GTTM and TPS analysis.

To change the volume, all instrument parts are separated from the input sound mixture using the corresponding standard MIDI file. For the separation, we used an integrated tone (timbre) model consisting of harmonic and inharmonic models that are initialized with template sounds recorded from a MIDI sound generator. The remaining but critical problem here is to deal with various performance styles and instrument bodies that are not given in the template sounds. To solve this problem, we train probabilistic distributions of timbre features by using various sounds.

Recent development of portable music players like iPod has increased the number of those who listen to music while exercising. However, few systems which connect exercises with music selection have been developed. We propose a system that automatically selects music suitable for user’s running exercises. Although many parameters can be taken into account, as a first step we focus on runner’s step frequency. This system selects music with tempo suitable for runner’s step frequency and when runner’s step frequency changes, it executes another music selection. The system consists of three modules: step frequency estimation, music selection, and music playing. In the first module, runner’s step frequency is estimated from data derived from an acceleration sensor. In the second module, appropriate music is selected based on the estimated step frequency. In the third module, the selected music is played until runner’s step frequency changes. In the experiment, subjects ran on a running machine at different paces listening to the music selected by the proposed system. Experimental results show that the system can estimate runner’s SPM accurately and on the basis of the estimated SPM it can select music appropriate for users’ exercises with more than 85.0% accuracy, and makes running exercises more pleasing.",JPN,education,Developed economies,"[21.930956, -19.701908]","[54.0813, 12.754262]","[9.186731, -22.901958, -7.4105024]","[6.109407, -21.387506, 18.53039]","[8.8605175, 5.743874]","[11.011404, 1.4660277]","[11.578541, 11.893672, 0.3367001]","[10.018371, 3.0923944, 1.3161283]"

This paper proposes noise-robust musical beat tracking by using a robot-embedded microphone, and describes its application to a robot singer with music recognition. The proposed beat tracking introduces two key techniques, that is, spectro-temporal pattern matching and echo cancellation. The former realizes robust tempo estimation with a shorter window length, thus, it can quickly adapt to tempo changes. The latter is effective to cancel self periodic noises such as stepping, scatting, and singing. We constructed a robot singer based on the proposed beat tracking for Honda ASIMO. The robot detects a musical beat with its own microphone in a noisy environment. It tries to recognize music based on the detected musical beat. When it successfully recognizes music, it sings while stepping according to the beat. Otherwise, it performs scatting instead of singing because the lyrics are unavailable. Experimental results showed fast adaptation to tempo changes and high robustness in beat tracking even when stepping, scatting and singing.",JPN,education,Developed economies,"[-49.254856, -17.668484]","[-25.433659, -25.594423]","[-15.241353, -30.905043, -4.5112247]","[-3.1091156, -17.023657, -8.511007]","[8.657028, 5.231978]","[11.142661, 1.6127815]","[11.8799305, 11.205564, 0.19987838]","[9.958818, 3.3715658, 1.4545363]"

These criteria are mathematically implemented as minimization of brightness differences of adjacent pixels and maximization of brightness variances within and between thumbnails. The optimized parameters of a modified linear mapping model we assumed are obtained by minimizing a unified cost function based on the three criteria with a steepest descent method.

The distance between each two segments is then calculated and the value is transformed to a probability that the two segments are occurrences of a same musical part. Different features are combined in the probability space and are used to define a fitness measure for a candidate structure description. Musicological knowledge of the temporal dependencies between the parts is integrated into the fitness measure. A novel search algorithm is presented for finding the description that maximises the fitness measure. The system is evaluated with a data set of 557 manually annotated popular music pieces.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for automatically detecting structural similarities and differences between two given versions of the same piece. The key idea is to perform a single structural analysis for both versions simultaneously instead of performing two separate analyses for each of the two versions. Such a joint structure analysis reveals the repetitions within and across the two versions. As a further contribution, we show how this information can be used for deriving musically meaningful partial alignments and annotations in the presence of structural variations.",DEU,education,Developed economies,"[-23.418442, 14.358151]","[4.0015364, -34.457256]","[3.2633855, -14.923924, 8.7811985]","[-1.7050815, -10.686248, -4.533824]","[10.653583, 6.970971]","[9.72873, 1.4140954]","[11.429652, 14.196205, -0.24469893]","[8.095431, 3.589707, -0.32561082]"

A dozen of descriptors have been designed, some of them dedicated to low-level characterizations of the onset detection curve, whereas the major part concentrates on descriptions of the periodicities developed throughout the temporal evolution of music. A high number of variants have been derived from the systematic exploration of alternative methods proposed in the literature on onset detection curve estimation. To evaluate the pulse clarity model and select the best predictors, 25 participants have rated the pulse clarity of one hundred excerpts from movie soundtracks.

Each recording is represented by a third-order feature tensor generated by the auditory model. Thus, the ensemble of recordings is represented by a fourth-order data tensor created by stacking the third-order feature tensors associated to the recordings. To handle large data tensors and derive compact feature vectors suitable for classification, three multilinear subspace techniques are examined, namely the Non-Negative Tensor Factorization (NTF), the High-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), and the Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). Classification is performed by a Support Vector Machine. Stratified cross-validation tests on the GTZAN dataset and the ISMIR 2004 Genre one demonstrate the advantages of NTF and HOSVD versus MPCA.

In each data set the rhythms are ranked either according to increasing complexity using the judgements of human subjects, or using calculations with the computational models.

In music information retrieval (MIR), one promising recent application of self-supervised learning is the CLMR framework (contrastive learning of musical representations). CLMR has shown good performance, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art end-to-end classification models, but it is strictly an encoding framework. It suffers the characteristic limitation of any encoder that it cannot explicitly combine multi-timescale information, whereas a characteristic feature of human audio perception is that we tend to perceive all frequencies simultaneously. To this end, we propose a generalization of CLMR that learns to extract and explicitly combine representations across different frequency resolutions, which we coin the tailed U-Net (TUNe). TUNe architectures combine multi-timescale information during a decoding phase, similar to U-Net architectures used in computer vision and source separation, but have a tail added to reduce sample-level information to a smaller pre-defined number of representation dimensions. The size of the decoding phase is a hyperparameter, and in the case of a zero-layer decoding phase, TUNe reduces to CLMR. The best TUNe architectures, however, require less training time to match CLMR performance, have superior transfer learning performance, and are competitive with state-of-the-art models even at dramatically reduced dimensionalities.",NLD,education,Developed economies,"[-6.2597413, -7.714721]","[-39.102234, 0.5088495]","[-8.672216, 10.729954, 12.1945095]","[-2.045711, -1.6614225, -25.909575]","[10.849825, 9.803475]","[8.083835, 5.583032]","[10.875154, 14.254769, 2.2070384]","[7.601692, 4.9318657, 1.9450487]"

As this approach enforces phase continuity, SawSing can generate singing voices without the phase-discontinuity glitch of many existing vocoders. Moreover, the source-filter assumption provides an inductive bias that allows SawSing to be trained on a small amount of data.

Contrastive methods are a popular choice for self-supervision in the audio domain, and typically provide a learning signal by forcing the model to be invariant to some transformations of the input. These methods, however, require measures such as negative sampling or some form of regularisation to be taken to prevent the model from collapsing on trivial solutions. In this work, instead of invariance, we propose to use equivariance as a self-supervision signal to learn audio tempo representations from unlabelled data. We derive a simple loss function that prevents the network from collapsing on a trivial solution during training, without requiring any form of regularisation or negative sampling.Our experiments show that it is possible to learn meaningful representations for tempo estimation by solely relying on equivariant self-supervision, achieving performance comparable with supervised methods on several benchmarks.

The work of twelve-tone composers is famously challenging to traditional Western tonal and structural sensibilities; even so, group theoretic approaches have determined that 10% of certain composers' works contain a highly unusual classical symmetry of music. We extend this result by revealing many symmetries that were previously undetected in the works of Schoenberg, Webern, and Berg. Our approach is computational rather than group theoretic, scanning each composition for symmetries of many different cardinalities. Thus, we capture partial symmetries that would be overlooked by more formal means. Moreover, our methods are applicable beyond the narrow scope of twelve-tone composition. We achieve our results by first extending the group-theoretic notion of symmetry to encompass shorter motives that may be repeated and reprised in a given composition, and then comparing the incidence of these symmetries between the work of composers and the space of all possible 12-tone rows.

Understanding how surprisal shapes listeners' preferences for certain musical pieces has implications for music recommender systems, which are typically content- (both acoustic or semantic) or metadata-based.

Second, using an audio- domain beat tracking model, we compute beat-related features of the input audio and use them as embeddings in the Transformer. Instead of generating the drum track directly as waveforms, we use a separate VQ-VAE to encode the mel-spectrogram of a drum track into another set of discrete codes, and train the Transformer to predict the sequence of drum-related discrete codes. The output codes are then converted to a mel-spectrogram with a decoder, and then to the waveform with a vocoder.

Recent vocoder models developed for speech achieve high degree of realism, such that it is natural to wonder how they would perform on music signals. Compared to speech, the heterogeneity and structure of the musical sound texture offers new challenges. In this work we focus on one specific artifact that some vocoder models designed for speech tend to exhibit when applied to music: the perceived instability of pitch when synthesizing sustained notes. We argue that the characteristic sound of this artifact is due to the lack of horizontal phase coherence, which is often the result of using a time-domain target space with a model that is invariant to time-shifts, such as a convolutional neural network. We propose a new vocoder model that is specifically designed for music. Key to improving the pitch stability is the choice of a shift-invariant target space that consists of the magnitude spectrum and the phase gradient.

Following AccoMontage, this study focuses on generating piano arrangements for popular/folk songs and it carries on the generalized template-based retrieval method. The novelties of this study are twofold. First, we invent a harmonization module (which AccoMontage does not have). This module generates structured and coherent full-length chord progression by optimizing and balancing three loss terms: a micro-level loss for note-wise dissonance, a meso-level loss for phrase-template matching, and a macro-level loss for full piece coherency. Second, we develop a graphical user interface which allows users to select different styles of chord progression and piano texture. Currently, chord progression styles include Pop, R&amp;B, and Dark, while piano texture styles include several levels of voicing density and rhythmic complexity. Experimental results show that both our harmonization and arrangement results significantly outperform the baselines.

This can be done in an efficient manner with models containing less than 100 million parameters that require no fine-tuning or reparameterization for downstream tasks, making this approach practical for industry-scale audio catalogs.Within the class of unsupervised learning strategies, we show that the domain of the training dataset can significantly impact the performance of representations learned by the model.

Drum beats tend to follow a repetitive pattern through stanzas with fills/improvisation at section boundaries. In this work, we tackle the task of drum pattern generation conditioned on the accompanying music played by four melodic instruments – Piano, Guitar, Bass and Strings. We use the transformer sequence to sequence model to generate a basic drum pattern conditioned on the melodic accompaniment to find that improvisation is largely absent, attributed possibly to its relatively low representation in the training data. We propose a novelty function that represents the extent of improvisation in a specific bar relative to its neighbors.

Using Top100 charts from these countries, we constructed a network based on the co-occurrence of songs in charts, and used eigencentrality as an indicator of cross-cultural song popularity. We then compared the country-of-origin of the artists, arousal music features, and socioeconomic indicators. Songs from artists with Anglo-American backgrounds tended to have higher eigencentrality overall, and mixed effects regressions showed that eigencentrality was negatively associated with danceability, and positively associated with spectral energy, and the migrant population of the country (of the charts). Next, using community detection, we observed 11 separate 'communities' in the network.

Songs claiming the same genre can sound very different if they are released years apart, and genres may revive musical traditions from the past. In this paper, I show that the performance of genre classifiers fluctuates as genres evolve. Unsatisfactory performance of the classifiers may not indicate algorithmic flaws but rather the change of genre characteristics. I demonstrate this by studying the case of Chinese Hip-Hop music. Specifically, I collected and analyzed 69,427 songs from four genres (Hip-Hop, Pop, Rock, and Folk) released on a Chinese music platform between 2009 and 2019. Using classifiers trained from the songs in different year cohorts to predict the genre of all the songs, I show how genre classifiers can be used to detect the stylistic shift in Hip-Hop that happened during this period. The paper thus offers a novel, sociological perspective on contending with the much-challenged idea of improving genre classification accuracy for its own sake. However, instead of questioning the effort, I argue that MIR research on genre classification can be helpful for studying genre as a social construct and cultural phenomenon if the pursuit of prediction performance and the cultural meaning of inaccurate prediction are carefully balanced.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[35.003185, -14.905059]","[13.855184, 20.038347]","[-0.85360503, 29.65775, 1.096435]","[8.851842, 19.168726, 4.4468393]","[12.275441, 11.536103]","[6.0354066, 4.1879673]","[12.148516, 15.028773, 3.2308517]","[5.3237996, 3.8394973, 0.06676799]"

In this paper, we briefly introduce our self-built CNPM (Chinese National Pentatonic Modes) Dataset, then design residual convolutional neural network models to identify which TongGong system the mode belongs, the pitch of tonic, the mode pattern and the mode type from audio signals, in combination with musical domain knowledge. We use both single-task and multi-task models with three strategies for identification, and compare them with a simple template-based baseline method. In experiments, we use seven accuracy metrics to evaluate the models. The results on identifying both the tonic pitch and the pattern of mode correctly achieve an average accuracy of 69.65%.

Furthermore, we also study three more potentially parameter-sensitive metrics for audio texture synthesis, (a) a Gram matrix based distance, (b) an Accumulated Gram metric using a summarized version of the Gram matrices, and (c) a cochlear-model based statistical features metric. These metrics use deep features that summarize the statistics of any given audio texture, thus being inherently sensitive to variations in the statistical parameters that define an audio texture. We study and evaluate the sensitivity of existing standard metrics as well as Gram matrix and cochlear-model based metrics in response to control-parameter variations for audio textures across a wide range of texture and parameter types, and validate with subjective evaluation.

In this study, we investigate the stability of feature group importance when different classification methods and different measures of classification quality are applied. Since musical scores are particularly helpful in deriving semantically meaningful, robust genre characteristics, we focus on the feature groups analyzed by the jSymbolic feature extraction software, which describe properties associated with instrumentation, basic pitch statistics, melody, chords, tempo, and other rhythmic aspects. These symbolic features are analyzed in the context of musical information drawn from five other modalities, and experiments are conducted involving two datasets, one small and one large. The results show that, although some feature groups can remain similarly important compared to others, differences can also be evident in various applications, and can depend on the particular classifier and evaluation measure being used.

This problem is referred to as domain shift and is commonly approached using domain adaptation (DA) methods. As one relevant scenario, automatic piano transcription algorithms in music learning applications potentially suffer from domain shift since pianos are recorded in different acoustic conditions using various devices. Yet, most currently available datasets for piano transcription only cover ideal recording situations with high-quality microphones. Consequently, a transcription model trained on these datasets will face a mismatch between source and target data in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we employ a recently proposed dataset which includes annotated piano recordings covering typical real-life recording settings for a piano learning application on mobile devices. We first quantify the influence of the domain shift on the performance of a deep learning-based piano multi-pitch estimation (MPE) algorithm. Then, we employ and evaluate four unsupervised DA methods to reduce domain shift.

The combination of generative pre-training and a new dataset for this task results in 77% stronger performance on melody transcription relative to the strongest available baseline.

Despite the difficulties in MSS due to the high correlation of musical sources in time and frequency, deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to substantial improvements to accomplish this task. For training supervised machine learning models such as DNNs, isolated sources are required. In the case of popular music, one can exploit open-source datasets which involve multitrack recordings of vocals, bass, and drums. For western classical music, however, isolated sources are generally not available. In this article, we consider the case of piano concertos, which are composed for a pianist typically accompanied by an orchestra. The lack of multitrack recordings makes training supervised machine learning models for the separation of piano and orchestra challenging. To overcome this problem, we generate artificial training material by randomly mixing sections of the solo piano repertoire (e.g., piano sonatas) and orchestral pieces without piano (e.g., symphonies) to train state-of-the-art DNN models for MSS.

We also demonstrate that by modifying input representations --- which in prior work using neural models have often taken the form of one-hot encodings over individual keys on the piano --- to encode relative position on the keyboard to the prior note instead, we can achieve much better performance. Additionally, we reassess the use of raw per-note labeling precision as an evaluation metric, noting that it does not adequately measure the fluency, i.e. human playability, of a model's output. To this end, we compare methods across several statistics which track the frequency of adjacent finger predictions that while independently reasonable would be physically challenging to perform in sequence, and implement a reinforcement learning strategy to minimize these as part of our training loss.

The domain adaptation approach has thus recently been taken for updating an ASR model pre-trained from sufficient speech data. In the naive application of the end-to-end approach to ALT, the internal audio-to-lyrics alignment often fails due to the time-stretching nature of singing features.

We then describe how these features complement each other and yield new state-of-the-art performances on two publicly available datasets.

Since we have a limited amount of data with real OMR errors, we employ extensive data augmentation to add errors into training data in a way that mimics how OMR would modify the score. Our best-performing models achieve 99% recall and 50% precision on this error-detection task.",CAN,education,Developed economies,"[-37.9816, 29.759813]","[-19.983246, 18.06937]","[-3.8103478, 3.0049808, 29.143764]","[-16.15685, -17.314016, 2.1080058]","[11.206773, 6.513262]","[9.296341, -0.64070183]","[11.481615, 12.913368, 0.20296985]","[8.375521, 2.4689786, 2.7899568]"

Furthermore, BAF provides cross-annotations with exact matching timestamps between Epidemic tracks and TV recordings. Approximately, 80% of the total annotated time is background music. (2) We benchmark BAF with public state-of-the-art AFP systems, together with our proposed baseline PeakFP: a simple, non-scalable AFP algorithm based on spectral peak matching. In this benchmark, none of the algorithms obtain a F1-score above 47%, pointing out that further research is needed to reach the AFP performance levels in other studied use cases.

Detecting such structures is vital for numerous MIR tasks such as musicological analysis, key detection, music segmentation, and others. However, automatic cadence detection remains a challenging task mainly because it involves a combination of high-level musical elements like harmony, voice leading, and rhythm. In this work, we present a graph representation of symbolic scores as an intermediate means to solve the cadence detection task. We approach cadence detection as an imbalanced node classification problem using a Graph Convolutional Network. We obtain results that are at least on par with the state of the art, and we present a model capable of making predictions at multiple levels of granularity, from individual notes to beats, thanks to the fine-grained, note-by-note representation. Moreover, our experiments suggest that graph convolution is able to learn non-local features that assist in cadence detection, freeing us from the need of having to devise specialized features that encode non-local context. We argue that this general approach to modeling musical scores and classification tasks has a number of potential advantages, beyond the specific recognition task presented here.",AUT,education,Developed economies,"[-5.1382194, -25.075907]","[-40.612617, 3.979103]","[-12.711036, -3.1522574, -2.34369]","[-14.247201, 5.7930946, -21.576773]","[10.58544, 8.023237]","[8.270179, 5.7994647]","[12.046013, 13.616937, 1.6860671]","[7.7193823, 4.641593, 2.0062695]"

A straightforward way is to control a model using different conditions during inference. However, in music practice, conditions are usually sequential (rather than simple categorical labels), involving rich information that overlaps with the learned representation. Consequently, the decoder gets confused about whether to listen to the latent representation or the condition, and sometimes just ignores the condition. To solve this problem, we leverage domain adversarial training to disentangle the representation from condition cues for better control. Specifically, we propose a condition corruption objective that uses the representation to denoise a corrupted condition. Minimized by a discriminator and maximized by the VAE encoder, this objective adversarially induces a condition-invariant representation. In this paper, we focus on the task of melody harmonization to illustrate our idea, while our methodology can be generalized to other controllable generative tasks.

To this end, we investigate both theory and applications of natural-tone loudness perception in this paper via modeling piano tone.

As for the application, we apply our theory to piano control transfer, in which we adjust the MIDI velocities on two different player pianos (in different acoustic environments) to achieve the same perceptual effect.

These models generally require large amounts of (annotated) training data to achieve high accuracy. Because not all applications in MIR have sufficient quantities of training data, it is becoming increasingly common to transfer models across domains. This approach allows representations derived for one task to be applied to another, and can result in high accuracy with less stringent training data requirements for the downstream task. However, the properties of pre-trained audio embeddings are not fully understood. Specifically, and unlike traditionally engineered features, the representations extracted from pre-trained deep networks may embed and propagate biases from the model's training regime. This work investigates the phenomenon of bias propagation in the context of pre-trained audio representations for the task of instrument recognition. We first demonstrate that three different pre-trained representations (VGGish, OpenL3, and YAMNet) exhibit comparable performance when constrained to a single dataset, but differ in their ability to generalize across datasets (OpenMIC and IRMAS).

In the standard OMR workflow, layout analysis is a critical component for identifying relevant parts of the image, such as staff lines, text, or notes. State-of-the-art approaches to this task are based on machine learning, which entails having to label a training corpus, an error-prone, laborious, and expensive task that must be performed by experts. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot strategy for building robust models by utilizing only partial annotations, therefore requiring minimal human effort. Specifically, we introduce a masking layer and an oversampling technique to train models using a small set of annotated patches from the training images. Our proposal enables achieving high performance even with scarce training data, as demonstrated by experiments on four benchmark datasets.

Meter, the most widespread example of such a temporal scheme, consists of several hierarchically organized pulses. Deviations from isochrony found in musical patterns are considered to form an expressive, micro level of organization that is distinct from the structural macro-organization of the basic pulse. However, polyrhythmic structures, such as those found in music from West Africa or the African diaspora, challenge both the hierarchical subdivision of durations and the structural isochrony of the above models. Here we present a model that integrates the macro- and micro-organization of rhythms by generating non-isochronous girds from isochronous pulses within a polyrhythmic structure. Observed micro-timing patterns may then be generated from structural non-isochronous grids, rather than being understood as expressive deviations from isochrony.

This paper proposes a Dual Attention-based Multi-scale Feature Fusion (DAMFF) method and a newly developed dataset named MER1101 for Dynamic Music Emotion Recognition (DMER). Specifically, multi-scale features are first extracted from the log Mel-spectrogram by multiple parallel convolutional blocks. Then, a Dual Attention Feature Fusion (DAFF) module is utilized to achieve multi-scale context fusion and capture emotion-critical features in both spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, a BiLSTM-based sequence learning model is employed for dynamic music emotion prediction.

Given one version of a piece as input, we train a network to minimize the distance between its output and time-frequency representations of other versions of that piece. 
Since all versions are based on the same musical score, we hypothesize that the learned output corresponds to pitch estimates. To further ensure that this hypothesis holds, we incorporate domain knowledge about overtones and noise levels into the network.

Former research concluded that the salience of mistakes depended on factors including their contextual appropriateness and a listener's degree of familiarity to what is being performed. A conspicuous error is considered to be an area where there is something obviously wrong with the performance, which a listener can detect regardless of their degree of knowledge of what is being performed. Analogously, this paper attempts to build a score-independent conspicuous error detector for standard piano repertoire of beginner to intermediate students. We gather three qualitatively different piano playing MIDI data: (1) 103 sight-reading sessions for beginning and intermediate adult pianists with formal music training, (2) 245 performances by presumably late-beginner to early-advanced pianists on a digital piano, and (3) 50 etude performances by an advanced pianist. The data was annotated at the regions considered to contain conspicuous mistakes. Then, we use a Temporal Convolutional Network to detect the sites of such mistakes from the piano roll. We investigate the use of two pre-training methods to overcome data scarcity: (1) synthetic data with procedurally-generated mistakes, and (2) training a part of the model as a piano roll auto-encoder. Experimental evaluation shows that the TCN performs at an F-measure of 0.78 without pretraining for sight-reading data, but the proposed pretraining steps improve the F-measure on performance and etude data, approaching the agreement between human raters on conspicuous error labels.

This vector summarises the pitches that are in the preceding and following contexts of the note. Next, we use these pitch context vectors to generate a list of candidate chords for each note. The candidate chords fit the pitch context of a given note each with a computed strength. Finally, we find an optimal path through the chord candidates, employing a score function for the fitness of a given candidate chord. The algorithm chooses one chord for each note, optimizing the total score. A set of heuristics is incorporated in the score function.

Previous studies on lyrics generation have focused on generating lyrics based on semantic constraints such as specific keywords, lyric style, and topics. However, these methods had limitations because users could not freely input their intentions as text. Even if such intentions can be given as input text, the lyrics generated from the input tend to contain similar wording, making it difficult to inspire the user. Our method is therefore developed to generate lyrics that (1) convey a message similar to the input text and (2) contain wording different from the input text. A straightforward approach of training a text-to-lyrics encoder-decoder is not feasible since there is no text-lyric paired data for this purpose. To overcome this issue, we divide the text-to-lyrics generation process into a two-step pipeline, eliminating the need for text-lyric paired data. (a) First, we use an existing text-to-image generation technique as a text analyzer to obtain an image that captures the meaning of the input text, ignoring the wording. (b) Next, we use our proposed image-to-lyrics encoder-decoder (I2L) to generate lyrics from the obtained image while preserving its meaning. The training of this I2L model only requires pairs of ""lyrics"" and ""images generated from lyrics"", which are readily prepared. In addition, we propose for the first time a lyrics generation method that reduces the risk of plagiarism by prohibiting the generation of uncommon phrases in the training data.

Typically, SDTW is used to iteratively compute and refine soft alignments that compensate for temporal deviations between the training data and its weakly annotated targets. One major problem is that a mismatch between the estimated soft alignments and the reference alignments in the early training stage leads to incorrect parameter updates, making the overall training procedure unstable. In this paper, we investigate such stability issues by considering the task of pitch class estimation from music recordings as an illustrative case study. In particular, we introduce and discuss three conceptually different strategies (a hyperparameter scheduling, a diagonal prior, and a sequence unfolding strategy) with the objective of stabilizing intermediate soft alignment results.

The decoder with high temporal resolution is designed to predict beat times at a desired resolution. In the decoder, the global structure is considered by the cross attention between the global features and high-dimensional features.

We confirmed that 1) the proposed data augmentation methods were highly effective for training generic Transformer models that generate tokenized outputs, 2) our proposed hybrid CTC-Attention model outperforms conventional methods that transcribe guitar performance with tokens, and 3) the addition of multi-task learning with CTC in our proposed model is especially effective when there is an insufficient amount of training data.",JPN,education,Developed economies,"[-38.649788, -28.797325]","[-36.9872, 0.7013447]","[-28.432924, -2.1627104, 0.6892829]","[-4.103832, -1.6377466, -15.423852]","[7.015636, 8.702482]","[8.637728, 5.711377]","[9.431433, 12.531759, 1.8713794]","[8.083042, 4.5499997, 2.048397]"

The SSL paradigm we use is equivariance to pitch transposition, which enables our model to accurately perform pitch estimation on monophonic audio after being trained only on a small unlabeled dataset.

We use a lightweight (&lt; 30k parameters) Siamese neural network that takes as inputs two different pitch-shifted versions of the same audio represented by its constant-Q transform. To prevent the model from collapsing in an encoder-only setting, we propose a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective which captures pitch information. Furthermore, we design the architecture of our network to be transposition-preserving by introducing learnable Toeplitz matrices.

We evaluate our model for the two tasks of singing voice and musical instrument pitch estimation and show that our model is able to generalize across tasks and datasets while being lightweight, hence remaining compatible with low-resource devices and suitable for real-time applications.

To faithfully encode such relations, we need an elegant way to represent both the semantics of prolongation, where a single event is elaborated into multiple events, and process, where the connection from one event to another is elaborated into multiple connections. In existing works, trees are used to capture the former and graphs for the latter. Each such model has the potential to either encode relations between events (e.g., an event being a repetition of another), or relations between processes (e.g., two consecutive steps making up a larger skip), but not both together explicitly. To model meaningful relations between musical events and processes and combine the semantic expressiveness of trees and graphs, we propose a structured representation using  algebraic datatype (ADT) with dependent type. We demonstrate its applications towards encoding functional interpretations of harmonic progressions, and large scale organizations of key regions. This paper offers two contributions.

To expand our dataset, we employ a semi-supervised model training pipeline that leverages the QbH task as a specialized case of cover song identification (CSI) task. Starting with a model trained on the initial dataset, we iteratively collect groups of fragments of cover versions of the same song and retrain the model on the extended data. Using this pipeline, we collect over 308 hours of additional music fragments, paired with time-aligned cover versions.

A typical and recent approach to this is to learn, via deep neural networks, a joint embedding space that correlates short fixed-size snippets of audio and sheet music by means of an appropriate similarity structure. However, two challenges that arise out of this strategy are the requirement of strongly aligned data to train the networks, and the inherent discrepancies of musical content between audio and sheet music snippets caused by local and global tempo deviations. In this paper, we address these two shortcomings by designing a cross-modal recurrent network that learns joint embeddings that can summarize longer passages of corresponding audio and sheet music. The benefits of our method are that it only requires weakly aligned audio - sheet music pairs, as well as that the recurrent network handles the non-linearities caused by tempo variations between audio and sheet music.

FlexDTW allows alignment paths to start anywhere on the bottom or left edge of the cost matrix (adjacent to the origin) and to end anywhere on the top or right edge.  In order to properly compare paths of very different lengths, we use a goodness measure that normalizes the cumulative path cost by the path length.  The key insight of FlexDTW is that the Manhattan length of a path can be computed by simply knowing the starting point of the path, which can be computed recursively during dynamic programming.  We artificially generate a suite of 16 benchmarks based on the Chopin Mazurka dataset in order to characterize audio alignment performance under a variety of boundary conditions.

This is analogous to natural language processing tasks where synonymous terms can be used interchangeably without significantly modifying the meaning of a text.  Our approach to modeling harmonic similarity borrows from NLP techniques, such as distributional semantics, by embedding chords into a vector space using a co-occurrence matrix.  We show that the method can robustly detect harmonic similarity between songs, even when reharmonized.  The co-occurrence matrix is computed from a corpus of symbolic jazz-chord progressions, and the result is a map from chords into vectors.

In this paper, we introduce SingStyle111, a large studio-quality singing dataset with multiple languages and different singing styles, and present singing style transfer examples. The dataset features 111 songs performed by eight professional singers, spanning 12.8 hours and covering English, Chinese, and Italian. SingStyle111 incorporates different singing styles, such as bel canto opera, Chinese folk singing, pop, jazz, and children. Specifically, 80 songs include at least two distinct singing styles performed by the same singer. All recordings were conducted in professional studios, yielding clean, dry vocal tracks in mono format with a 44.1 kHz sample rate. We have segmented the singing voices into phrases, providing lyrics, performance MIDI, and scores with phoneme-level alignment. We also extracted acoustic features such as Mel-Spectrogram, F0 contour, and loudness curves. This dataset applies to various MIR tasks such as Singing Voice Synthesis, Singing Voice Conversion, Singing Transcription, Score Following, and Lyrics Detection. It is also designed for Singing Style Transfer, including both performance and voice timbre style. We make the dataset freely available for research purposes.

Our approach leverages the degree of harmonic information held within a musical audio signal (its ""keyness"") as well as the steadiness of local key detections across the its duration (its ""stability""). Using this confidence measure, musical tracks which are likely to be misclassified, i.e. those with low confidence, can then be handled differently from those analysed by standard, fully automatic key detection methods. By means of a listening test, we demonstrate that our developed features significantly correlate with listeners' ratings of harmonic complexity, steadiness and the uniqueness of key. Furthermore, we demonstrate that tracks which are incorrectly labelled using an existing key detection system obtain low confidence values.

However, if applied on the level of chord sequences, RNNs indeed can become powerful chord predictors. In this paper, we disentangle temporal models into a harmonic language model—to be applied on chord sequences—and a chord duration model that connects the chord-level predictions of the language model to the frame-level predictions of the acoustic model.

The proposed method is based on a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network architecture directly trained with pairs of spectrograms and their corresponding symbolic scores in Western notation. Unlike standard pitch estimation methods, the proposed architecture does not need the music symbols to be aligned with their audio frames thanks to a Connectionist Temporal Classification loss function. Training and evaluation were performed using a large dataset of short monophonic scores (incipits) from the RISM collection, that were synthesized to get the ground-truth data.

First, existing data may be augmented, allowing the transcriber to be trained using recordings with modified timbres. Second, additional individual recordings from sample libraries are included to generate rare combinations. We present three versions of the PvT model: AugExist, which augments pre-existing recordings; AugAddExist, which adds additional samples of drum hits to the AugExist system; and Generate, which generates training examples exclusively from individual drum hits from sample libraries. The three versions are evaluated alongside a state-of-the-art deep learning ADT system using two evaluation strategies.

At the present, models of harmonic syntax face challenges on the tasks of detecting local and higher-level modulations (most previous models assume a priori knowledge of key), computing connected parse trees for long sequences, and parsing sequences that do not end with tonic chords, but in turnarounds. This paper addresses those problems by proposing a new generative formalism Probabilistic Abstract Context-Free Grammars (PACFGs) to address these issues, and presents variants of standard parsing algorithms that efficiently enumerate all possible parses of long chord sequences and to estimate their probabilities. PACFGs specifically allow for structured non-terminal symbols in rich and highly flexible feature spaces. The inference procedure moreover takes advantage of these abstractions by sharing probability mass between grammar rules over joint features.

However, they do not generalize to novel examples and do not provide an invertible mapping, preventing audio synthesis. Here, we show that Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) can bridge these lines of research and alleviate their weaknesses by regularizing the latent spaces to match perceptual distances collected from timbre studies. Hence, we propose three types of regularization and show that they lead to spaces that are simultaneously coherent with signal properties and perceptual similarities. We show that these spaces can be used for efficient audio classification. We study how audio descriptors are organized along the latent dimensions and show that even though descriptors behave in a non-linear way across the space, they still exhibit a locally smooth evolution. We also show that, as this space generalizes to novel samples, it can be used to predict perceptual similarities of novel instruments.

Therefore, we investigate end-to-end source separation in the time-domain, which allows modelling phase information and avoids fixed spectral transformations. Due to high sampling rates for audio, employing a long temporal input context on the sample level is difficult, but required for high quality separation results because of long-range temporal correlations. In this context, we propose the Wave-U-Net, an adaptation of the U-Net to the one-dimensional time domain, which repeatedly resamples feature maps to compute and combine features at different time scales. We introduce further architectural improvements, including an output layer that enforces source additivity, an upsampling technique and a context-aware prediction framework to reduce output artifacts. Experiments for singing voice separation indicate that our architecture yields a performance comparable to a stateof-the-art spectrogram-based U-Net architecture, given the same data.

A user experiment was conducted with 23 participants who searched for music in a novel MIR system. Users' listening behaviors and self-reported emotion responses to a total of 628 music pieces were collected. During music listening, a series of peripheral physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance) were recorded from participants unobtrusively using a researchgrade wearable wristband. A set of features in the time- and frequency- domains were extracted from the physiological signals and analyzed using statistical and machine learning methods. Results reveal 1) significant differences in some physiological features between positive and negative arousal and mood categories, and 2) effective classification of emotion responses based on physiological signals for some individuals.

These utterances leverage the well-known speech-to-song illusory transformation which results in very catchy and easy to reproduce motifs. A second dataset provides EEG recordings for the perception of 10 full length songs. Using a multi-view deep generative model we demonstrate the feasibility of learning a shared latent representation of brain activity and auditory concepts, such as rhythmical motifs appearing across different instrumentations. Introspection of the model trained on the rhythm dataset reveals disentangled rhythmical and timbral features within and across subjects.

The second goal is to explain our methodology where dataset creation and learning models interact using a teacher-student machine learning paradigm that benefits each other. We start with a set of manual annotations of draft time-aligned lyrics and notes made by non-expert users of Karaoke games. This set comes without audio. Therefore, we need to find the corresponding audio and adapt the annotations to it. To that end, we retrieve audio candidates from the Web. Each candidate is then turned into a singing-voice probability over time using a teacher, a deep convolutional neural network singing-voice detection system (SVD), trained on cleaned data.

There are, however, many potential pitfalls, especially in early music, where scores are edited in different ways: variables include clefs, note values, types of barline, and editorial accidentals. Different score editors and optical music recognition software have their own ways of storing and exporting musical data. Choice of software and file formats, and their various parameters, can thus unintentionally bias data, as can decisions on how to interpret potentially ambiguous markings in original sources. This becomes especially problematic when data from different corpora are combined for computational processing, since observed regularities and irregularities may in fact be linked with inconsistent corpus collection methodologies, internal and external, rather than the underlying music.  This paper proposes guidelines, templates, and workflows for the creation of consistent early music corpora, and for detecting encoding biases in existing corpora.

There is variation among the nineteen musicians considered, but on average, the precision of CPNs increases exponentially with duration and settles at about 10 cents for CPNs longer than 0.5 seconds. For analyzing STAs, in contrast to Western music, r¯aga (melody) information is found to be necessary, and errors in STAs show a significantly larger standard deviation of about 60 cents. To corroborate these observations, the music was automatically transcribed and re-synthesized using CPN and STA information using two interpolation techniques.

Skipgrams have been found to be a powerful model for capturing semi-local dependencies in sequences of entities when dependencies may not be directly adjacent (see, for instance, the problems of modeling sequences of words or letters in computational linguistics). Since common skipgrams define locality based on indices, they can only be applied to a single stream of non-overlapping entities. This paper proposes a generalized skipgram model that allows arbitrary cost functions (defining locality), efficient filtering, recursive application (skipgrams over skipgrams), and memory efficient streaming. Further, a sampling mechanism is proposed that flexibly controls runtime and output size. These generalizations and optimizations make it possible to employ skipgrams for the discovery of repeated patterns of close, nonsimultaneous events or notes. The extensions to the skipgram model provided here do not only apply to musical notes but to any list of entities that is monotonic with respect to a given cost function.",CHE,education,Developed economies,"[-11.77283, 10.352907]","[23.074512, -19.702856]","[-3.4884658, 1.1007165, 13.595104]","[17.36889, -13.334554, 1.384276]","[10.669416, 8.440352]","[7.787563, 1.5474739]","[11.709439, 13.753721, 1.4844157]","[7.22243, 2.0160208, -1.2157922]"

Therefore, visualizing instrumentation can help listeners browse music more efficiently. Instrudive visualizes musical pieces by illustrating instrumentation with multi-colored pie charts and displays them on a map in accordance with the similarity in instrumentation. Users can utilize three functions. First, they can browse musical pieces on a map by referring to the visualized instrumentation.

Finally, they can discern the temporal changes in instrumentation and skip to a preferable part of a piece with a multi-colored graph.

The features belonging to the middle level can both improve automatic recognition of high-level descriptors, and provide new music retrieval possibilities. Mid-level features are subjective and usually lack clear definitions.

Domain adaptation is an approach aiming to eliminate the distributional discrepancy of the modeling data, so as to transfer learnable knowledge from one domain to another. With its great success in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, domain adaptation also shows great potential in music processing, for music is essentially a highly-structured semantic system having domaindependent information. Our proposed model contains a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes the training data into a latent space, and the resulting latent representations along with its model parameters are then reused to regularize the representation learning of the downstream task where the data are in the other domain. The experiments on cross-domain music alignment, namely an audioto-MIDI alignment, and a monophonic-to-polyphonic music alignment of singing voice show that the learned representations lead to better higher alignment accuracy than that using conventional features.

When it detects that her confidential attributes can be predicted, it selects songs that can decrease the prediction accuracy and recommends them to her. The user can camouflage her play logs by playing these songs to preserve her demographic anonymity.

Most current approaches compute the similarity between two melodic sequences by comparing their local features (distance between pitches, intervals, etc.) or by comparing the sequences after aligning them. In order to find a better feature representing global characteristics of a melody, we propose to represent the melodic sequence of each musical piece by the parameters of a generative Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on its sequence. Because the trained RNN can generate the identical melodic sequence of each piece, we can expect that the RNN parameters contain the temporal information within the melody. In our experiment, we first train an RNN on all melodic sequences, and then use it as an initialisation to train an individual RNN on each melodic sequence.

Among them, Poisson matrix factorization (PMF) has raised a lot of interest, since it seems well-suited to the implicit data provided by listening counts. Additionally, it has proven to achieve state-ofthe-art performance while being scalable to big data. Yet, CF suffers from a critical issue, usually called cold-start problem: the system cannot recommend new songs, i.e., songs which have never been listened to. To alleviate this, one should complement the listening counts with another modality. This paper proposes a multi-modal extension of PMF applied to listening counts and tag labels extracted from the Million Song Dataset. In our model, every song is represented by the same activation pattern in each modality but with possibly different scales.

Recent advances in deep learning have turned typical OMR obstacles into clearly solvable problems, especially the stages that visually process the input image, such as staff line removal or detection of music-notation objects. However, merely detecting objects is not enough for retrieving the actual content, as music notation is a configurational writing system where the semantic of a primitive is defined by its relationship to other primitives. Thus, OMR systems must employ a notation assembly stage to infer such relationships among the detected objects. So far, this stage has been addressed by devising a set of predefined rules or grammars, which hardly generalize well. In this work, we formulate the notation assembly stage from a set of detected primitives as a machine learning problem. Our notation assembly is modeled as a graph that stores syntactic relationships among primitives, which allows us to capture the configuration of symbols in a music-notation document. Our results over the handwritten sheet music corpus MUSCIMA++ show 95.2% precision, 96.0% recall, and an F-score of 95.6% in establishing the correct syntactic relationships.

Other, larger datasets such as OpenMIC only have weak labels, i.e., instrument presence or absence is annotated only for long snippets of a song. We explore an attention mechanism for handling weakly labeled data for multi-label instrument recognition. Attention has been found to perform well for other tasks with weakly labeled data. We compare the proposed attention model to multiple models which include a baseline binary relevance random forest, recurrent neural network, and fully connected neural networks.

The ReliefF algorithm is applied to select significant features from conducting movement, and recurrent neural network (RNN) is implemented to identify multiple movement cues.

Although there are various systems for music retrieval based on the similarity between songs or artists and for music browsing based on visualized songs, it is still difficult to explore unfamiliar content by flexibly combining multiple musical aspects. Query-by-Blending overcomes this difficulty by representing each of the aspects as a latent vector representation (called a ""flavor"" in this paper) that is a distinctive quality felt to be characteristic of a given word/song/artist. By giving a lyric word as a query, for example, a user can find songs and artists whose flavors are similar to the flavor of the query word.  Moreover, by giving a query combining (blending) lyric-word and song-audio flavors, the user can interactively explore unfamiliar content containing the blended flavor. This multi-aspect blending was achieved by constructing a novel vector space model into which all of the lyric words, song audio tracks, and artist IDs of a collection can be embedded. In our experiments, we embedded 14,505 lyric words, 433,936 songs, and 44,696 artists into the same shared vector space and found that the system can appropriately calculate similarities between different aspects and blend flavors to find related lyric words, songs, and artists.",JPN,facility,Developed economies,"[22.04711, 8.187399]","[43.996346, 19.21751]","[3.377354, 19.945442, -21.926777]","[15.169747, 1.8770539, 15.25331]","[12.53446, 9.398266]","[5.6734333, 3.4437714]","[11.211562, 16.492764, 0.70194674]","[5.1243033, 3.0058198, -0.8434167]"

In this article, we investigate methods for automatically enhancing structural annotations by inferring (and expanding) hierarchical information from the segment labels. The proposed method complements existing techniques for comparing hierarchical structural annotations by coarsening or refining labels with variation markers to either collapse similarly labeled segments together, or separate identically labeled segments from each other.

A typical solution to this problem is a proposed orchestral score where candidate scores are ranked by similarity in some feature space between the target sound and the mixture of audio samples in the database corresponding to the notes in the score; in the orchestral setting, valid scores may contain dozens of instruments sounding simultaneously.  Generally, target-based assisted orchestration systems consist of a combinatorial optimization algorithm and a constraint solver that are jointly optimized to find valid solutions.  A key step in the optimization involves generating a large number of combinations of sounds from the database and then comparing the features of each mixture of sounds with the target sound.  Because of the high computational cost required to synthesize a new audio file and then compute features for every combination of sounds, in practice, existing systems instead estimate the features of each new mixture using precomputed features of the individual source files making up the combination.  Currently, state of the art systems use a simple linear combination to make these predictions, even if the features in use are not themselves linear.  In this work, we explore neural models for estimating the features of a mixture of sounds from the features of the component sounds, finding that standard features can be estimated with accuracy significantly better than that of the methods currently used in assisted orchestration systems.

In this work, we aim to jointly exploit low- and high-level audio features and model the prediction as a regression task. Particularly, we make use of a wide and deep neural network architecture that allows for jointly exploiting low- and high-level features. Furthermore, we enrich the set of features with information about the release year of tracks. We evaluate our approach based on the Million Song Dataset and characterize a song as a hit if it is contained in the Billboard Hot 100 at any point in time.

First, the number of publicly available datasets for this task is limited, and there is no publicly available benchmark set that is widely used among researchers for comparative algorithm evaluation.

To overcome these limitations we propose Da-TACOS, a DaTAset for COver Song Identification and Understanding, and two frameworks for feature extraction and benchmarking to facilitate reproducibility. Da-TACOS contains 25K songs represented by unique editorial metadata plus 9 low- and mid-level features pre-computed with open source libraries, and is divided into two subsets. The Cover Analysis subset contains audio features (e.g. key, tempo) that can serve to study how musical characteristics vary for cover songs.

Such structure can be captured elegantly using probabilistic grammatical models similar to those used to study natural language. They address the complexity of the structure using abstract categories in a recursive formalism. Most existing grammatical models of musical structure focus on one single dimension of music--such as melody, harmony, or rhythm. While these grammar models often work well on short musical excerpts, accurate analysis of longer pieces requires taking into account the constraints from multiple domains of structure. The present paper proposes abstract product grammars--a formalism which integrates multiple dimensions of musical structure into a single grammatical model--along with efficient parsing and inference algorithms for this formalism. We use this model to study the combination of hierarchically-structured harmonic syntax and hierarchically-structured rhythmic information. The latter is modeled by a novel grammar of rhythm that is capable of expressing temporal regularities in musical phrases. It integrates grouping structure and meter. The combined model of harmony and rhythm outperforms both single-dimension models in computational experiments.

One major challenge in F0-based tonal analysis is introduced by unstable regions in the trajectories due to pitch slides and other frequency fluctuations. In this paper, we describe two approaches for detecting stable regions in frequency trajectories: the first algorithm uses morphological operations inspired by image processing, and the second one is based on suitably defined binary time–frequency masks. To avoid undesired distortions in subsequent analysis steps, both approaches keep the original F0-values unmodified, while only removing F0-values in unstable trajectory regions.

Introducing invertibility enables the practitioner to directly inspect what the discriminative model has learned, and exactly determine which inputs lead to which outputs.

This is an entirely new approach to audio transcription, which first of all necessitates some groundwork.

Of these previous approaches, only constraint programming has led to a successful solution. Unfortunately, this solution is expensive in terms of computation time. We present here two new search heuristics and a modification to a previously proposed heuristic, that, when applied to a greedy backtracking algorithm, allow the all-partition array problem to be solved in a practical running time.

Recent approaches to melodic elaboration have converged to a representation based on intervals, which allows the elaboration of pairs of notes. However, two problems remain: First, an interval-first representation obscures one-sided operations like neighbor notes. Second, while models of Western melody styles largely agree on step-wise operations such as neighbors and passing notes, larger intervals are either attributed to latent harmonic properties or left unexplained. This paper presents a grammar for melodies in North Indian raga music, showing not only that recursively applied neighbor and passing note operations underlie this style as well, but that larger intervals are generated as generalized neighbors, based on the tonal hierarchy of the underlying scale structure. The notion of a generalized neighbor is not restricted to ragas but can be transferred to other musical styles, opening new perspectives on latent structure behind melodies and music in general.

The pitch activation input is structured to allow the first CNN layer to compute two pitch chromas focused on different octaves. The following layers perform harmony analysis across chroma and time scales. Through max pooling across pitch, the CNN becomes invariant with regards to the key class (i.e., key disregarding mode) of the music. A multilayer perceptron combines the modality activation output with spectral features for the final prediction. The study uses a dataset of 203 excerpts rated by around 20 listeners each, a small challenging data size requiring a carefully designed parameter sharing. With an R2 of about 0.71, the system clearly outperforms previous systems as well as individual human listeners.

In this study, we focus on symbolic music with the goal of altering the 'style' of a piece while keeping its original 'content'. As opposed to the current methods, which are inherently restricted to be unsupervised due to the lack of 'aligned' data (i.e. the same musical piece played in multiple styles), we develop the first fully supervised algorithm for this task. At the core of our approach lies a synthetic data generation scheme which allows us to produce virtually unlimited amounts of aligned data, and hence avoid the above issue. In view of this data generation scheme, we propose an encoder-decoder model for translating symbolic music accompaniments between a number of different styles.

In general, an analogy is made by partially transferring the music abstractions, i.e., high-level representations and their relationships, from one piece to another; however, this procedure requires disentangling music representations, which usually takes little effort for musicians but is non-trivial for computers. Three sub-problems arise: extracting latent representations from the observation, disentangling the representations so that each part has a unique semantic interpretation, and mapping the latent representations back to actual music. In this paper, we contribute an explicitly-constrained variational autoencoder (EC^2-VAE) as a unified solution to all three sub-problems. We focus on disentangling the pitch and rhythm representations of 8-beat music clips conditioned on chords. In producing music analogies, this model helps us to realize the imaginary situation of ""what if"" a piece is composed using a different pitch contour, rhythm pattern, or chord progression by borrowing the representations from other pieces.

The difficulty mainly lies in the intrinsic long-tail distribution of chord qualities, and most chord qualities have too few samples for model training.  In this paper, we propose a new model for audio chord recognition under a huge chord vocabulary. The core concept is to decompose any chord label into a set of musically meaningful components (e.g., triad, bass, seventh), each with a much smaller vocabulary compared to the size of the overall chord vocabulary. A multitask classifier is then trained to recognize all the components given the audio feature, and then labels of individual components are reassembled to form the final chord label.

In the composition stage, a short clip of randomly-generated music was used as a seed for the RNN to start music score prediction. To form structured music, segments of generated music from different seeds were concatenated together. To improve the quality and structure of the generated music, we integrated music theory knowledge into the model, such as controlling the spacing of gaps in the vocal melody, normalizing the timing of chord changes, and requiring notes to be related to the song's key (C major, for example). This integration improved the quality of the generated music as verified by a professional composer.

These approaches commonly employ supervised learning models that predict various time-frequency representations, by minimizing element-wise losses such as the cross entropy function.

To address this issue, we introduce an adversarial training scheme that operates directly on the time-frequency representations and makes the output distribution closer to the ground-truth. Through adversarial learning, we achieve a consistent improvement in both frame-level and note-level metrics over Onsets and Frames, a state-of-the-art music transcription model.

""Voicing"" refers to whether or not a pitch is active, and has historically been regarded as a binary value. However, this has limitations because it is often ambiguous whether a pitch is present or absent, making a binary choice difficult for humans and algorithms alike. For example, when a source fades out or reverberates, the exact point where the pitch is no longer present is unclear. Many single-f0 estimation algorithms select a threshold for when a pitch is active or not, and different choices of threshold drastically affect the results of standard metrics. In this paper, we present a refinement on the existing single-f0 metrics, by allowing the estimated voicing to be represented as a continuous likelihood, and introducing a weighting on frame level pitch accuracy, which considers the energy of the source producing the f0 relative to the energy of the rest of the signal.

For reconstruction, latent variables of timbre and pitch are sampled from corresponding mixture components, and are concatenated as the input to a decoder. We show the model's efficacy using latent space visualization, and a quantitative analysis indicates the discriminability of these spaces, even with a limited number of instrument labels for training. The model allows for controllable synthesis of selected instrument sounds by sampling from the latent spaces. To evaluate this, we trained instrument and pitch classifiers using original labeled data. These classifiers achieve high F-scores when tested on our synthesized sounds, which verifies the model's performance of controllable realistic timbre/pitch synthesis.

This is commonly addressed by defining some heuristic notion of pattern significance, and returning only the most significant patterns. This paper develops a method of pattern discovery that models human judgement of what constitutes a significant pattern by incorporating annotations of repeated patterns, avoiding the need to design heuristics.  We take pattern discovery as a clustering task, where the input is a set of passages of monophonic music, represented as vectors of extracted features, and the output clusters correspond to discovered patterns. The human annotations are used to train a neural network to learn a low-dimensional embedding of the feature space that maps passages of music close together when they are occurrences of the same ground-truth pattern. The results of this approach match up with the annotations significantly better than the results of an approach using clustering without subspace learning. We provide examples of the types of patterns that this method tends to discover and discuss its feasibility and practicality as a tool for extracting useful information about repetitive structure in music.",CAN,education,Developed economies,"[0.18092206, -4.2907624]","[16.93312, -20.89492]","[-0.35227558, 9.598622, 5.515545]","[-12.633415, -13.901965, 12.499175]","[11.331141, 9.858812]","[7.8596315, 2.043738]","[10.902519, 15.473335, 1.7348895]","[7.4289975, 2.6061327, -1.0179415]"

A typical scenario involves manual annotation of different recordings of the same piece along the time dimension, for comparative analysis of, e.g., the musical tempo, or for mapping other performance-related information between performances. This can be done by manually annotating one reference performance, and then automatically synchronizing other performances, using audio-to-audio alignment algorithms. In this paper we address several questions related to those tasks. First, we analyze different annotations of the same musical piece, quantifying timing deviations between the respective human annotators. A statistical evaluation of the marker time stamps will provide (a) an estimate of the expected timing precision of human annotations and (b) a ground truth for subsequent automatic alignment experiments. We then carry out a systematic evaluation of different audio features for audio-to-audio alignment, quantifying the degree of alignment accuracy that can be achieved, and relate this to the results from the annotation study.",AUT,education,Developed economies,"[-22.738297, 16.850546]","[3.3887095, -36.80504]","[1.3858018, -16.078949, 11.551128]","[-5.3287935, -11.512713, -4.209619]","[10.670754, 6.9898057]","[10.387827, 1.0944359]","[11.454767, 14.0989, -0.35943183]","[9.304959, 2.6657922, 1.4083227]"

Although the previously proposed system employing a noise suppression process and a rule-based pitch control approach has achieved preliminary success in converting EL speech into a singing voice, there are still two major limitations. First, the converted singing voice still sounds mechanical and unnatural owing to the adverse impacts of spectrograms extracted from EL speeches, also making the effect of pitch control limited. Second, the capability and flexibility of the rule-based pitch control in modeling various singing styles are insufficient, causing the converted singing voices to lack variety. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an improved system that uses 1) a statistical voice conversion approach to convert spectrograms extracted from EL speeches into those of natural speeches and 2) a deep generative model-based approach called VAE-SPACE for pitch modification, which generates pitch patterns in a data-driven manner instead of following manually designed rules. The experimental results revealed that 1) the conversion of spectrograms was effective in improving the naturalness of singing voices, and 2) the statistical pitch control approach was able to achieve comparable results with the rule-based approach, which was very carefully designed to be specialized in singing.",JPN,education,Developed economies,"[-0.015242229, -41.128883]","[-39.86253, -15.886145]","[-15.088837, -14.463437, -16.138332]","[-2.5804417, 11.990249, -23.697792]","[8.27051, 11.493427]","[9.655081, 5.9001403]","[8.34877, 14.916365, 0.5390963]","[8.061285, 5.6887326, 1.5343316]"

We present an interactive workflow to address these problems, and test it on Bach chorales. First, a rule-based model was used to generate preliminary, consistent chord labels in order to pre-train three machine learning models. These four models were grouped into an ensemble that generated chord labels by voting, achieving 91.4% accuracy on a reserved test set. A domain expert then corrected only those chords that the ensemble did not agree on unanimously (20.9% of the generated labels). Finally, we used these corrected annotations to re-train the machine learning models, and the resulting ensemble attained an accuracy of 93.5% on the reserved test set, a 24.4% reduction in the number of errors. This versatile interactive workflow can either work in a fully automatic way, or can capitalize on relatively minimal human involvement to generate higher-quality chord labels.

Although human similarity judgments are the gold standard, computational analysis is often preferable, since results are often easier to reproduce, and computational methods are much more scalable. Moreover, computation based approaches can be calculated quickly and on demand, which is a prerequisite for use with an online system. We propose StyleRank, a method to measure the similarity between a MIDI file and an arbitrary musical style delineated by a collection of MIDI files. MIDI files are encoded using a novel set of features and an embedding is learned using Random Forests. Experimental evidence demonstrates that StyleRank is highly correlated with human perception of stylistic similarity, and that it is precise enough to rank generated samples based on their similarity to the style of a corpus. In addition, similarity can be measured with respect to a single feature, allowing specific discrepancies between generated samples and a particular musical style to be identified.",CAN,education,Developed economies,"[13.680764, -2.573515]","[16.333277, -0.71440554]","[3.4033282, 8.343893, -6.4057612]","[11.096718, 4.2074637, 7.381828]","[11.431585, 10.2828665]","[6.9953876, 3.2155273]","[10.746625, 16.043467, 2.0641577]","[6.3111596, 3.2331996, -1.0529917]"

Improvements in deep learning lead to a big progress in music source separation performance. However, most of the previous studies are restricted to separating a few limited number of sources, such as vocals, drums, bass, and other. In this study, we propose a network for audio query-based music source separation that can explicitly encode the source information from a query signal regardless of the number and/or kind of target signals. The proposed method consists of a Query-net and a Separator: given a query and a mixture, the Query-net encodes the query into the latent space, and the Separator estimates masks conditioned by the latent vector, which is then applied to the mixture for separation. The Separator can also generate masks using the latent vector from the training samples, allowing separation in the absence of a query. We evaluate our method on the MUSDB18 dataset, and experimental results show that the proposed method can separate multiple sources with a single network. In addition, through further investigation of the latent space we demonstrate that our method can generate continuous outputs via latent vector interpolation.",KOR,education,Developing economies,"[-15.719369, -40.749557]","[-47.344036, -15.612663]","[-15.547899, -21.178923, 15.461866]","[-13.514444, -0.03916971, -30.254627]","[7.2076006, 10.507686]","[10.283919, 5.7631793]","[8.661312, 13.740644, -0.4620867]","[8.657287, 6.004493, 0.85523474]"

To this end, we first collect a set of multimedia clips that include both music and corresponding dance motion. We then extract the joint coordinates of the dancer from video and the mel-spectrogram of music from audio and train our network using music-choreography pairs as input.

In this work, we investigate how to utilize local data representation with pattern recognition for onset and offset detection of singing voice. We consider onset and offset detection as a hierarchical classification problem, where every local data representation as input is classified into one of all the possible event states in monophonic singing, namely the silence, activation, and transition states, and the transition state is further classified into the onset and offset states. An objective function based on this hierarchical taxonomy nicely guides the model to capture the complicated temporal dynamics of note sequences. Multi-channel data representations containing spectral differences and pitch saliency are employed to reflect the patterns of note transition in singing voice signals. The proposed method implemented with residual networks provides improved performance over prior art in onset and offset detection. Moreover, by integrating with a pitch detection framework, the proposed method also outperforms previous singing voice transcription methods. This result emphasizes the importance of note segmentation in singing voice transcription.",TWN,education,Developing economies,"[2.1728754, -43.628677]","[-19.660095, -31.41171]","[-10.902071, -18.02603, -17.968699]","[6.2813854, -16.81089, -13.103743]","[8.431892, 11.519375]","[10.833073, 2.3891692]","[8.619988, 14.954015, 0.70002496]","[9.911579, 3.8746166, 0.79882497]"

While audio-sheet music retrieval has been explored by a number of works, this scenario is novel in that the query is a cell phone picture rather than a digital scan.  To solve this problem, we introduce a mid-level feature representation called a bootleg score which explicitly encodes the rules of Western musical notation.  We convert both the MIDI and the sheet music into bootleg scores using deterministic rules of music and classical computer vision techniques for detecting simple geometric shapes.  Once the MIDI and cell phone image have been converted into bootleg scores, we estimate the alignment using dynamic programming.  The most notable characteristic of our system is that it does test-time adaptation and has no trainable weights at all--only a set of about 30 hyperparameters.  On a dataset containing 1000 cell phone pictures taken of 100 scores of classical piano music, our system achieves an F measure score of .869 and outperforms baseline systems based on commercial optical music recognition software.",USA,education,Developed economies,"[-25.946936, 8.207445]","[7.7149577, -36.620003]","[-4.8477445, -16.766354, 1.087611]","[-10.825373, -11.461884, -7.17683]","[10.089823, 7.307704]","[9.715176, 0.13715804]","[11.666503, 13.730029, 0.28557584]","[8.777637, 2.4417837, 2.1564546]"

Human listeners can readily distinguish melodies from accompaniment; however, making this distinction given only the written score – i.e. without listening to the music performed – can be a difficult task. Solving this task is of great importance for both Music Information Retrieval and musicological applications.  In this paper, we propose an automated approach to identifying the most salient melody line in a symbolic score. The backbone of the method consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) estimating the probability that each note in the score (more precisely: each pixel in a piano roll encoding of the score) belongs to the melody line. We train and evaluate the method on various datasets, using manual annotations where available and solo instrument parts where not.
